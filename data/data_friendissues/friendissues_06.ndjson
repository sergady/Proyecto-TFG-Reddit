Might tell you more if you're interested in knowing. \n\nEver since, I've never been able to keep, what I would call, long friendships, be it online or offline.\n\nAnyway, I love video games, PC, PS4, etc. Right now, I play mostly League of Legends and Overwatch but I've been a MMORPG fan for a long time. Played Metin2, Aion, Tera, GW2 and many more. I wasn't the best player, but my focus was always to meet new people with the same interests and be kind of decent at the game at the same time. I also love games where you can interact with the story...eg: Any Telltale game, The Witcher 1/2/3, Mass Effect 1/2/3/A...this type of games. The last I played was Detroit: Become Human and I loved it.\n\nMore...I love music of all kinds and I love to discuss different bands and getting know more bands/singers. \n\nI'm also a big fan of sports, e-Sports, wrestling (WWE, etc). \n\n\nThere's a lot more I like, but I wouldn't like to make this all about me and then we wouldn't have much to talk about! \n\nSo, yeah...I could use someone to just chat about any stuff...people tell I'm a good listener, so if you need to someone to talk to, I'm here. It goes both ways. \n\n\nThanks for reading and have a nice day.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I've had friends at times in my life but they never lasted. I am unfriendable. I am datable, heck I am marriable, proof is my husband of 4 years. It's not that I'm a bad person, I'm not. All the friendships ended simply from fading away or because they couldn't use me for anything anymore. Maybe I'm not interesting or maybe I'm too weird I don't know. These past friends never were honest with me really. Maybe I was too desperate for friendship and they ran. Anyway, my reason for saying this is because if anyone for some reason feels like trying for a friendship with me I think maybe having this knowledge will help explain a bit about me.  \n  \nSo a bit about what I am into. \n  \n\u2022 I play videogames, but with kids it's rare I have a chance. Most games I'm into I can't play right now because they aren't pausable. I'll give some examples. DotA 2, Sims, Minecraft, battlefield 4, tons more but I spent a lot of time on those.\n\n\u2022 I used to read a lot. Like a crazy amount. One year I couldn't afford books so I only used the library. At the end of the year I discovered they could look up how many books you've taken out. It was something like 200 books in one year of high school. Mostly young adult stuff but it's been years since I've picked up a book to read for fun.\n\n\u2022 I love being a home maker. Everything about it is so rewarding to me. I got excited because I finally got the toy storage shelf I've been wanting for months. Yes I want things like that. \n\n\u2022 I talk a lot\n   \nThere is more but my kiddo woke up haha.

She's also been cancelling our weekly dinners. She hasn't been replying to my texts, and leaving my snaps on read. Even when we're hanging out, it's been silence, as if she's just completing a task. I fear that she either: \n\na) Has gotten bored of me (which has happened before with other people) \n\nb) Thinks that I'm a terrible person, for I thought we were close enough for me to complain to her about certain people and certain problems I faced \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I've been doing: I've been pretending that I didn't notice anything happening. I've been asking her to hangout just like I normally do, not more, not less. I haven't been talking to her more, nor less. \n\n  \nWhat should I do about this situation? Should I proceed with what I've been doing, hoping things will get better (with the possibility of the situation a) or b) actually be happening) ? Should I talk to her about this?

Perhaps, if I talked to her, she'll think I'm needy, and completely cut me out of her life...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf she has lost interest in me...is the best thing to do just give up and focus on building other friendships? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

The entire friendship we have defiantly had our rocky moments. When she gets angry at a situation instead of calmly talking, she gets angry and says extremely hurtful things. About 2 months ago we had a big blow up because she was extremely jealous of me hanging out with another friend. She texted me these horrible things and told me I had to decide between her or this other friend. I obviously told her, I am not making that decision your being crazy right now and you can not ask me to do that. She continued saying horrible things like \"maybe I should get pregnant again...oh wait that's right you cant have kids\" and \"your the scum of the earth and a disgrace to society\" like just awful things. I ended that friendship that day and have not looked back, I felt like how could I be friends with someone that I was so open and honest about my infertility problems and she just threw them in my face. So now about 3 weeks ago I got a phone call from her daughter. Now let me start off by saying that this friend has 4 children ranging from 12-18 and I am very close with her kids, so close they call me their second mom. So the daughter called me and said that mom(friend) was in the hospital she had overdosed on medication and tried to commit suicide. I went to the hospital to make sure she was okay because she was obviously going through a tough time but i went more for the kids because they said they needed me. This \"friend\" proceeded to start crying and saying she had really messed up with what she did to me and she hates herself everyday for it. She told me she has alot going on in her life and she just could not handle it anymore.

Shes also became friends with my ex bestfriend when i was too depressed to go out with anyone and isolated myself.

NOW, here is the really weird part. We once hung out to smoke weed and when I fell asleep on her bed that we were sharing I woke back up to her touching my lips with her finger gently, and then my hair (shes bisexual).

This used to bother me but i learned not to care.\nSo yesterday me and my brother decided to sleep over at his house. The night went by and the story im about to tell happened earlier today.\nSo we were outside. His mom was going to leave to go to a store but we were all staying. We are just chilling outside and he starts jokingly throwing sticks at me, we all throw a few at each other and all is good. To avoid the sticks, i separate myself from the group and went to stand by a tree while in a call with someone. My friend throws a few more from a distance and then starts throwing rocks. I throw a few back and he then throws a water bottle at me, which almost hits me but i threw it back. It seems like in the throwing, the bottle ripped open because it had a few holes in the bottom where water was leaking. He starts chasing me with it and sprays me a total of three times. Keep in mind, im wearing $120 shoes and am going to get picked up in about one and a half hours so i wouldnt have times to fully take care of them and simply airdrying them would stink them up.\nAfter the third spray, i said \"If you do that again imma smack you\". \nAnd he does it again so i chase him a few feet and he runs so i said something along the lines of \"thats right, run away\"\nHe comes back and says \"Whatchu gonna do?\" So i smacked him like i had warned him that i would. After this a fight breaks out where i end up with a ripped shirt but overall i won (which is irrelevant)\nHis mom ended up taking us with her to make sure we wouldnt fight again.\nNow he is mad and blames me saying that i cant take a joke. Keep in mind this is after months of being targeted by him when in a group. I feel like i was justified because he drove me to that point and also because i was very straightforward in warning him of what would happen.\nIs this really my fault, and should i try to fix it/what should i do to fix it?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "bvozn7", "created_utc": 1559419952, "title": "friend problem", "author": "benjamin253", "self_text": "So i have this friend who used to be my closest same gender friend and probably my closest friend living in the same town as me. He is not a very social person and doesn't have any other friends living in the same town at the moment, but we manage to become pretty close friends in high school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is that lately he is being rather rude and not friendly. We used to get into silly arguments very often but it was one of the aspects that made our friendship work I think. He recently started not wanting to have any arguments with me, thinking it's pointless to tell me his opinion, because he thinks for some reason that i would never listen. It's true that we have different opinions on some subjects so i don't always follow his exact advice, however I always kept it in mind and took it into consideration when deciding what to do. He doesn't seem to understand that, even though I have explained it to him very times. He used to avoid further conversation very often if we didn't agree on something but lately he avoids entirely the whole conversation. He even was sort of rude back then, telling me every argument I use is bullshit and that im an idiot for saying that and then ending the conversation. Even though it bothered me, it wasnt that much of a problem till last month, when he started avoiding every other conversation with me online. Until then we used to talk all the time on Messenger about literally everything on our mind, sharing news, thoughts, funny stuff etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell recently he started ignoring my messages, reading but not answering almost anything and when i asked why he said something like \"I don't have the time to be bored and talk to you, I am always busy with my hobbies so I don't respond unless it's something interesting or important\". I would respect if he was just very busy, but the problem is that he is all day staying online at home, besides hitting the gym 1 hour/day. I don't mind him being busy, but I think if he was that busy we just wouldn't check messenger and choose to what he will respond. It's like he chooses when he wants to talk. Like a selective friendship. Even when it's something important he says that \"if i think it's something you can solve on your own, i won't respond\". He insists that in that way we will always talk about stuff that matter, but the problem is that when he feels like it, he sends random pointless stuff like the old times. Like he doesnt think he should respond to my small talk and trivial things but when he does it's really interesting. I just feel good when I let him know my news etc, like we are communicating, i really enjoyed that kind of connection we had before but he says that he realised its stupid because im not his diary and i should be informed about everything he does. He also justifies himself sending pointless stuff he would have ignored if they were sent by me saying \"you can also not answer, i dont expect you to answer\". I find it a really poor explanation, if you share something with someone it's only logical you want to receive some kind of commentary. (I'm not talking about stuff like articles etc which you only send to the other so he can read them, just small talk and funny/trivial stuff)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe also hang out 1-2 times per week, but he seems really bored of me and has many times implyed that he only hangs out with me due to his lack of friends. In general he doesn't seem very fond of me, telling me i'm a boring person and often criticizing my appearance or habbits saying \"sorry im being honest/telling you the truth\". He doesn't seem to understand the difference between honesty and being polite. I get it's a sign of bein very familiar with me that he chooses to express that way but that doesnt always translate well in friendship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday i decided that i want to distance myself from him, i didn't talk to him all day but when we hang out with other friends on the afternoon we was behaving normally, like nothing has happened even though i told him all this. And he says that he never said that he doesnt want to hang out, he thinks im just being weird. I find our friendship kinda toxic but the truth is he is one friend i can be sure he will be there to hang out if i want. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo idk im very confused. He does seem like a bad friend but in the same time he says he doesn't have some serious problem with me and will hang out if i want. Also we are part of the same group of friends and we will go on vacation together this summer and i am thinking it will be pretty awkward if i stop talking to him.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I live in Scotland, Glasgow specifically, although I actually live in Paisley ^(but it's right on the edge of Glasgow so it sorta counts and Glasgow sounds better) but it doesn't matter too much.\n\nAnyhow, don't expect me to get this excited when we're actually talking, in actuality I have very little social skills, I'm lacking in the communication department. I don't exactly have any friends which is why I'm gonna post here as a last resort, because internet friends are much better than no friends, amirite? Just please, *please* don't ghost me, if you don't feel like we're getting along all that well then just say how you feel and then maybe I won't feel depressed and at fault, sorry if I sound a bit annoyed about this , it's just that it has happened, many times before.\n\nSo, now that we've got that out of the way, I'll talk about my interests, of which there isn't very much, unfortunately. I'm very used to the indoors and will decline any offer to go outside unless I'm literally shoved out. I'm mostly into books, movies, and gaming - more specifically I enjoy dark horror books, with Stephen King being a particular favourite of mine, although I am kinda suffering from burnout because I was reading so much, and I don't have any more books to read so a recommendation would be dandy. I'm a dangerous psychopath, so I watch a lot of raunchy horror trash when it comes to movies, and while they're unreasonably grotesque and unpleasant they are very enjoyable flicks ; oh, and I like to watch more traditional slasher movies of course. I enjoy vast genres of games, but what they all have in common is a sense of freedom. I'm a fan of games like Hitman, Dead by Daylight, Fallout 76 and other stuff. Surprsingly I've also taken an interest in more linear titles like the Danganronpa trilogy, or the Uncharted games too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I'm more looking for long term friends than just a quick chat, I set my expectations high hehe. We can talk here, or on Discord. Anywhere else kinda causes me discomfort, although Snapchat is okay too I guess. I hope we can be friends hehe, I really do.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I see them making the same mistakes that I have made, and dealing with the repercussions.  They vent to me when everything goes wrong, and I cannot help but get frustrated.  I told them not to do it but they did it anyways.  But I feel like what kind of friend or family member would I be, if I said, \"I told you so\" or if I did not answer their phone calls or texts.  It breaks my heart to hear them crying over the phone.  I feel what they feel, so I guess this is why I am depressed.\n\nI usually play video games to help me, but I have no desire.  I think partly because I do not like to play by myself.  I would just like someone to talk to.  I really have no one.  Because of me feeling depressed, I have essentially cut ties with everyone.

Her dad practically abandoned her and her mum so they moved interstate when she was young which is where we met and I have stuck by her side ever since. She was very rebellious while her mum was very controlling and I mean VERY controlling so I took my friends side all the time. I\u2019m saying all this because she moved with her mum back to where they were originally from after something really devastating happened (it\u2019s not my story to tell) and now she is short on money.\n\nRecently she drove ten hours to come stay with us so she could see her old friends (she spent the majority of the time getting high and smoking with her other friends) but I was ecstatic. We hadn\u2019t seen each other in months so she stayed about a week, we went to a theme park where my family paid for pretty much everything since she didn\u2019t have much (because she refused to get a job which I now know) and she drove home. I soon realised that I\u2019d left my really good headphones in her car and she had left her glasses with us so I organised with her to post both the items back and I\u2019d pay the postage fee for her. I posted the glasses back within a week (on May 13th). I still haven\u2019t got my headphones. I realised that she was in her Snapchat with one of my shirts on. Dumbfounded, I checked my draws and determined that yes, she had taken my shirt. I texted her on May 19th letting her on know that she must of taken it by accident and she replied apologising and saying she\u2019d post it with the headphones ASAP. She called my mum without me knowing and asked for $100 on the 21st and on the same day posted another snap with my shirt on. After making my friend promise that she\u2019d pay her back, my mum agreed to lend the $100. I have been texting, calling and snapchatting her ever since then but she hasn\u2019t replied or picked up once. She still has my headphones and shirt. Today I snapped her again to no reply and sixteen minutes after I sent it she posted another snap looking perfectly happy without replying to me.\n\nI\u2019m very annoyed but most of all upset since I really believed she was my friend and would go out of her way for me like I do all the time for her.

He told me just recently that he was too busy in his life with work to talk or anything for several months and that maybe we ought to say goodbye or to choose if I want to talk to him or continue the story. He said if I won't choose, he'll follow through on his goodbye. Now here's the thing - I have huge fear of abandonment (from my childhood) so I really find it immensely hard to say goodbye to anyone. I keep getting myself in knots trying to make something work out, thinking back to when we got on so well to now. It feels like such a waste of time and maybe I'm responsible for him pushing me away (he said things that annoyed him about me). I feel so broken. So honestly I don't know what to do, there doesn't seem like a resolution. He said he would talk to me later a day ago so I haven't been able to. It's stupid how much this is getting to me when he doesn't seem to give a damn. It's just hard when I've conditioned myself to talk to him so much about everything.

One of my online friends suggested that I try Reddit to make some connections. I figured that I'd give it a try because I've found that most other online avenues haven't been all that productive (I've tried a few chat and friend-making apps). I suppose that I should discuss some of my interests: writing, reading, history, genealogy, traveling, and board games. I'd say that I like some video games, but from reading some other posts on here, it seems like for me to say that would be a bit like false advertising because I'm not really into too many things. For the most part, I just play computer strategy games like AoE and Civ, as well as some Nintendo ones and Elder Scrolls/MLB games. My main passion is writing, and it'd be amazing to connect with other writers or other artists. I'm currently working on a few projects (fantasy, supernatural, and historical fiction), and I just find that I can feed off other people's enthusiasm when I'm trying to maintain motivation.

(I also lived 10 minutes away from her then) I feel terrible for not seeing her as much but I\u2019m trying to better my life mentally and physically. My boyfriend and I are planning on getting married in a couple years and we\u2019re gonna finally be able to afford our own place soon. I\u2019m really excited to start my life with my boyfriend. She thinks I spend too much time with him and as she says \u201cyou\u2019re stuck up his ass all the time\u201d. What started the fight was that she needed a ride home from work and I couldn\u2019t help because my boyfriend and I were having date night. I asked if I could come over afterwards to pick up some recreational things and to hang out but she said she wasn\u2019t gonna be home.

She got mad and blew up on me saying that this was what she was talking about \u201cyou\u2019re stuck up his ass again so I guess were not gonna hang out today\u201d. I was very confused by this because she had just told me the other day that she had to work.

We stopped talking for a couple weeks and now she asked if I wanted to come pick up my recreational stuff since that\u2019s what made us stop talking. I told her that it was ok and I didn\u2019t need it. It has nothing to do with why we stopped talking.

In public I sadly don't have many friends and most are on here from Reddit. I've met some great people on here and I hoped I can meet some more interesting people to become friends with. Don't worry about those I'm already talking with I will still talk with you. Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nI just recently graduated from college with a degree in film. I suffer from both anxiety and depression. It effects me a lot on day to day basis mostly depression. Some days I'm fine Some I'm not. So if I complain about being depressed please understand I can't control it and at least be sympathetic towards it.\n\nI'm also somewhere on the spectrum. Its not as severe as other people probably, like you wouldn't think It because I'm on the high functioning side of the spectrum. However my social skills are really bad which makes it difficult to make friends in real life. \n\nI'm a very shy, lonely and boring person. I have a hard time making conversation so I might be boring to talk to. I will try my best. I don't have much in life as I'm searching for work at the moment. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Game of Thrones, The Handmaid's Tale, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03. If you going to message me I recommend you being around my age at least 18-26. Nobody younger or older to chat with cause I feel it would be awkward lol. I can make some exceptions. \n\nImportant, don't bother sending me a message if your just going to ghost. It really hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Also I  don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again. It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have a Kik, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now. Until we get to know each other more. I prefer the pm message box and not the chat but whatever works for you. So yeah just msg me your age, gender, and a little bit about yourself so I know you read all this lol.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Since moving here I've just struggled to make friends outside of work because I'm there full time. Anyway a bit about me\n\nMusic:\n\nI love music. Playing or listening, and anything else inbetween. My favorite bands are Animal Collective, The Garden, Beach House, Walter TV, Tonstartssbandht, MGMT, Death Grips, Homeshake, Lumpy and The Dumpers, Total Control, Night Manager. I'm really into making any sort of music, or even just discussing it. If you have any bands to suggest me please do, I'm always open. I also play Synth, Guitar, Drums and a bit of Bass.\n\nTV/Movies:\n\nI'm a sucker for animation/comedy; The Simpsons, Futurama, Workaholics, It's Always Sunny, Peep show. These have got to be my alltime favorite but also don't mind a bit of trash TV. Moviewise I really love anything truly bad. Troll 2 is a classic, just watched \"The Meg\" and it really was horrendous. The Room is a classic but we really need to delve into proper B-grade horror films.\n\nSport:\n\nGod I'm sorry but I am quite useless with all of them, but.....I do love bouldering. Find it to be great fun and good exercise, so it's nice to get the best of both worlds hahahaha. I am still a complete beginner but have found it just to be so much fun.\n\nOther Stuff:\n\nReally like just unusable facts that you must strategically plot into a conversation; there's a bell at Oxford University whose battery has been running since 1840.

My friend of 5 years (a really good friend, or so I thought) became a mother 2 years ago. I\u2019ve tried to organise catch-ups with her and sent her messages but she just doesn\u2019t have the time for me. Which I\u2019ve now accepted. She\u2019s busy, I get it.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve not accepted is her slyly putting me down, I feel it\u2019s because I don\u2019t have a partner or a child(ren). I\u2019m sure she thinks I\u2019m being too picky when I comes to men. I\u2019m attractive, I have a good job and a fulfilling life but I\u2019m also 35 which means I should settle down by society\u2019s standards. I\u2019m childless by choice and I\u2019ve never been great at choosing a good partner (I.e. one that isn\u2019t abusive). So that being said I\u2019m also sort of doing the single thing and focusing on life, friendships, personal development, etc. I\u2019m also dating but taking things cautiously because of my track record.\n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t know if this is a jealousy thing because I am living the single dream (I\u2019m not, I\u2019m just a regular, compassionate person who tries her best to have a relationship with my friend and her beautiful daughter) or whether she actually thinks she\u2019s better than me. Maybe it\u2019s a combination?\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do? Do I just let this friendship fizzle out? I feel it\u2019s one sided. It feels like whenever we see each other she\u2019s educating me on life and that she knows best, now that she\u2019s a mother. When we try and catch up she brings her girl who is beautiful and who I love seeing \u2013 but all her attention is on her (as it should be). She also asks questions about my dating life which is pretty much non existent and so I feel like this is the way she sort of puts me down to make herself feel better... Am I imagining this? Am I stupid for feeling like this? I know I have a lot of empathy and I\u2019m a bit more sensitive to these things. But sometimes my sensitivity is just spot on and I can read a situation for what it is... I.e. that she\u2019s jealous and annoyed that she\u2019s stuck and wants to make herself feel better by putting me down...\n\nI guess I just needed to vent but also would love insight from moms who are in this situation... what can I do to be a good friend?

Politely disagreeing is useless, just leading to a barrage of other points about how whatever is still bad. Now I just ignore whatever criticism she has and change the subject.\n\nThe only reason I haven't cut her out yet is because she's also my husband's friend and now his subordinate at work and I'm not trying to create any drama.

Just tell me what your heart says\n\nbf It's not about being right or wrong .I asked you before going and afterwards once I knew you were hurt I didn't repeat it and have been honest with you about it .And you're punishing me for being honest with you\n\nme Okay let me explain to you what I am feeling and thinking.The kind of woman who invites a taken man out at midnight is not the kind of woman I'd want hanging around my partner. Especially if she's not connecting with me on facebook. Regardless of what's going on there - if it's romantic or not - there is too much emotional dependence. I wouldn't go out to the beach at midnight with a friend - male or female - just because a date ended badly. She's 28 - what's the big crisis?\u00a0\n\nbf She's 32 I think\n\nme Frankly, why do you feel you can't say NO to her? Telling me to talk on FB is not the solution. Why can't YOU stand up for yourself?\n\nbf Say no to her when? I'm telling you frankly I won't hang out with her ever\n\nme That's not what it's about This is about what has already happened\n\nbf But nothing has happened! She's never even hit on me.And I can't prove something which never happened\n\nme When she asked you to meet upland she was very well aware of the fact that you're in a relationship, couldn't you have enough respect for me and our relationship to tell her no, that is not appropriate .Why did you guys hangout at the beach the second time? Was she having emotional problems again?\n\nbf Because at that point of time I didn't realize that I was doing something wrong... Something that would hurt you .But now I do.And it won't be repeated ever again\n\nme You still haven't answered my question.I want to know why she asked to hangout at the beach the second time around\n\nbf The same way you chill with your friends if I remember correctly\n\nme Chill with a male friend? Late at night ?Alone with him at the beach?\n\nbf No second time was during day time.I don't recall going out on the beach\n\nAt night\n\nme This is why I thought we have fundamental differences we need to sort out.I trust you now, however,I don't trust her intentions.At least not until I've talked to her\n\nbf And I understand that.And telling you I won't have contact with her\n\nme But I need to talk to her so that I can move on.I can't just forget it like nothing happened\n\nbf Yes I understand\n\nme I'm going to wait a couple of days more for her to respond for my request Or at least just reply to my message\n\nbf I pinged her today.She replied after like 4 hours .She's with her mom.I'll just tell her to reply to your messages\n\nme Alrighty,thank you.I'm really sorry,I know this is hurting you alot But trust me,it's hurting me even more\n\nbf I know\n\nme I just hope we can resolve this issue soon:)\n\nbf You're just a lot more sensitive because of everything that is going on and you need security.The other day you mentioned about your dad liking someone else even after his marriage.And you feel same thing might happen to you. I understand but you also need to know I'm not like that...I don't know why you would even think that about me\n\nI never said anything cuz sometime you've to understand the other person too... Factor in their happiness too (not saying I'm happy with \\*female coworker\\* lol) .And most importantly trust that the other person loves you.Because if they do then they'll be honest with you.And your gut feeling is wrong(I told him I've a gut feeling the coworker likes him).I would've known if that was the case .She's much older than me and we've never had that chemistry... She's always treated my like a friend/little bro.Else I would have pulled back\n\nme you know I feel like you're both closer in terms of age.And you might understand her better and she might understand you better too\n\nbf But she's bigger in age... Girls can't be bigger in age lol\n\nme Plus you guys work in the same field.Plus she's looking for someone to marry, even dating like 3-4 guys simultaneously.She's probably interested in you but is too afraid to say it? Since she thinks you might not reciprocate\n\nbf Uhh.See.In office.Who ever Desi (means someone from a south asian origin) joins we try to network and become friends because that's the only family we have.Same is the case here too\n\nAfterwards, we made up.The girl still hasn't accepted my friend request OR replied to my text, it's been days now.\n\nI don't know if I should do what my heart says, which is to trust my bf, or keep investigating further in order to save myself from getting hurt in the future.\n\nDo you guys think something is going on between them?\n\nTl;dr Was going to breakup with my bf because I highly suspected cheating.

{"post_id": "bw89cf", "created_utc": 1559549938, "title": "Friend got married with telling her friends or family", "author": "HoneybeesAndPeonies", "self_text": "There's... So much to this. I'll try to condense it. \n\nI have a friend that I've known for about 10 years now, we'll call her Mary. We've become close over the years- not best friends, but we saw each other weekly and shared a tight friend group. Our friend group has a wide spectrum of ages, with she, I and another girl being in our late 20s. Myself and the other girl married soon after college, but Mary was still looking for that special someone. Basically, she's one of those girls who just wanted a husband, several kids, and a white picket fence (no judgement please).\n\nAt the end of April, Mary mentioned she was going on a date. We were all excited for her and began asking about him. That was pretty much all I'd heard. Fast forward a few weeks. Mary had decided, after a whole 18 days of knowing this guy, to get married in a quick ceremony where this guy works (we'll call him John). I found out a week and a half after the fact when a friend called me. \n\nObviously I was surprised and a bit hurt, but thought that maybe we just weren't as close as I thought, no big deal. But the issues were just beginning. As it turns out, Mary invited NONE of her family or friends, including her parents (her now husband had time to invite several friends and many family members). Her 2 co-workers were in attendance, in fact they walked her down the \"aisle.\" She texted her ex-boyfriend immediately (they're not close, and he was getting engaged a week later), and most everyone else found out a week or more later via text or Instagram/Facebook(she shared a picture of them on their honeymoon and changed her IG name). \n\nWhen I saw her the first time, she's like \"I've got some news to share!\" and then looked completely confused as to how I would already know she was married. To my knowledge, she told no one in person- all through text in the case of her parents, or, in her best friend's case, social media. When I saw her, she tried to make excuses as to why she hadn't told me (we're 2.5 weeks past the wedding at that point) but I told her that she needed to own her choices and have some compassion to others who are finding this out in less than desireable ways. \n\nAs it turns out, John has been arrested previously (none of us, including her, know for what), he's in his early 30's and was living with his parents (he moved into her small apartment), he's deeply in debt, less than a year out of a long term relationship, at the very least dabbles in drugs, wants one kid (tops), and doesn't align with Mary's beliefs in the least. She's showing some alarming traits like being unable to discuss anything but her husband or tattoos (he's a tattoo artist), to the point where she's constantly looking at photos of him while they're apart. When asked about what she likes about him, she can't really tell us anything except that he's \"nice.\" She's a pretty expressive person, so this is unusual. \n\nI've not been hard on her and have tried to be as supportive as I can (because I think she's going to need a steady friend) but as time goes on and her story comes out further, the less I really want to maintain a relationship with her. Myself and another friend were the only ones besides her parents who came to a celebratory BBQ, and I could tell by the way her co-workers reacted that she'd been badmouthing us, which I'd suspected.  To our faces she acts grateful that we're still hanging in there, but her lack of honesty in the whole situation makes me not trust her. \n\nDo I continue trying to bridge the gap, or do I put some distance between us? I know she will need a friend, but I also don't believe it's my job to \"fix\" any if this, since I've don't nothing wrong. I also realize that friendships run their course and sometimes end. \n\nI'm introverted and hate conflict/awkward situations, but I've been trying to hang in there. It seems like people feel like they need to talk to me about it; the entire friend group came to me separately over 4 days, each trying to process it with me, which was exhausting. I'm just weary, but I don't want to cut ties prematurely.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

And maybe not a I\u2019ll never talk to them again, but an eye opening, where my place is feeling. \n\nBack story: known each other since 5yo, went through school, drifted apart a bit during college but mostly still talked and hung out regularly.. I felt we were always really close/ could count on them for anything.    \n\n One of my friends I\u2019ve known since I was 5 got married yesterday. When she first got engaged I was fully expecting to be included in her wedding party since we\u2019d only talked about this our whole lives... well none came... I was hurt but I understood and got over it.. I guess I got an invite at least even though i received the invite after the \u201cplease respond by\u201d date... maybe it was a mistake... I was still getting to go. \n\nWell the wedding was last night. I went and took my boyfriend (of 1.5 years that neither one of them have ever met...) and throughout the whole ceremony I just kept feeling more alienated... there was two girls in the wedding party I had never met and our third friend in the group was the maid of honor... I was hurt by that.. but fine, maybe she had to use her husbands family.. \n\nI didn\u2019t really start feeling really bad until the reception. I had to hunt down the one friend to say hello and got a few minutes of chat, but she was distracted and really not willing to have a full conversation. After dinner I finally got around to my friend getting married, and she seemed generally happy to be me, but was also disconnected and didn\u2019t say much.. when it came time for the speeches, the maid of honor( who was our third girl in this friend group) gave hers.. and they talked and cried and we\u2019re all talking about how their time together was amazing... and I just felt so left out of this lifelong friendship I always thought i was a part of.. but had the feeling I had missed out on all of it.. I left shortly after feeling really hurt and feeling like my friendship had been very one sided for the last few years.. \n\nI don\u2019t really know where to go from here, is there any advice I can give?

I\u2019ll say that my current favorite artist is probably Jeremy Zucker though, if I could only pick one. \n\nGames are another big thing. When I\u2019m not at school or sleeping, I\u2019m probably playing games. Most of that time is spent on Halo, the series that\u2019s been a part of my life for many years, and I\u2019m highly competitive at. Though, it\u2019s not the only thing, and I do have a decent computer for games as well as having my Xbox. Video games aren\u2019t just it though, as I grew up on games like Nertz and Carcassonne, among others. The one kind of game that I\u2019m really not into are physical based ones, like sports. I\u2019ve been into rock climbing and some recreational sports, but never any spots at any sort of competitive level. \n\nAnd uh, photography. Something I\u2019ve been kinda into off and on, but it\u2019s just something small that I\u2019ve gotten a little known for by some classmates and the such. I love shooting pictures of people, and I love to shoot when traveling...which brings me to probably my final thing, which is travel. I love to travel, and I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to have been able to visit 18 countries so far. Don\u2019t ask me for my favorite, I don\u2019t have one. I\u2019ll tell you the most memorable experiences though ;) \n\nFeel free to message me here, though I\u2019d much rather you ask for my discord tag so we can talk there.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

{"post_id": "bwdnv0", "created_utc": 1559584405, "title": "A former friend asked me why I stopped talking to her, should I be honest?", "author": "idcbuthereiam", "self_text": "TL;DR: I (female, 30) slowly drifted apart from a close friend (female, 30) after years of very subtle toxic behavior on her part. A year after not talking to her, she emailed me to ask what happened. Should I reply?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a lot to unpack here, so I'm going to try to keep this simple. I was pretty close with this person, knew her since high school, we hung out a lot, were in each other's weddings. She referred to me as her best friend, even asked me to get a best friends tattoo with her once, and she didn't really have any other close friends. (I considered us close friends, but I knew deep down she wasn't my best friend). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithout getting into the nitty gritty, she would say passive aggressive things to me frequently over the years. I admit that I avoid confrontation so I never said anything to her, but I also kept telling myself that she probably hadn't intended her words to be mean and that I was reading too far into it. Oftentimes she would make condescending comments relating to money and material possessions - she and her husband were very wealthy, and I was not as well off as her. One specific example: She once told me \"My husband's car costs twice as much as your house\". She was often very generous though - she would always offer (and then insist) on paying for me when we went out to coffee shops or restaurants. That is one thing I feel embarrassed about in retrospect, because I really should've told her \"no\" more often when she offered. Now I question whether she felt like I was using her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter she found out I was pregnant, the passive-aggressive behavior got worse (she has always been vocal about disliking children / never wanting kids). She would say pretty mean/judgmental things about parents in general, make anger-filled statements about children and how awful they are, and make comments about how \"pregnancy ruins your body\" and say \"I don't want to be fat forever so I would never have kids\" (sure makes me feel great during a giant change to my life and to my body!). One statement from her that really upset me was, \"I know that parents are all completely miserable but they just tell everyone they're happy with their kids because they're trying to convince themselves, you know they secretly hate their lives and regret having kids\". It was almost like she was trying to convince me to be unhappy. The final straw was when she was showing me something on her phone, and I saw a text pop up from her husband where they were discussing how bad I looked. I know I'm not a perfect person but I can honestly say I don't sit around with my husband and insult my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen my first child was around two, she noticed that I was keeping my distance. She asked me about it, and I was honest. I told her I felt like we may not be compatible friends because of her stance of parents and children, and that my kid is my world so her comments make me uncomfortable. Of course, this wasn't the only thing she'd been mean to me over, but I didn't think it would help anything to list off every mean thing she'd ever said to me. Her response was to delete me off all social media, and she sent me an email that called me selfish for not confronting her sooner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe ended up talking after that. She apologized for being mean, said she never meant to come off like she hates parents or children, and apologized for the mean comments she made about me with her husband. I forgave her, and she said she'd make more of an effort to think before she talks in the future. After that we continued to talk and text each other, she even reached out and offered to take maternity photos for me because I was pregnant with my second child. Right around this same time, my sister posted on Facebook, \"What is an unpopular opinion you have?\" and my friend commented on it to say \"I think that people who have children are selfish\". She had to have known I would see it or that my sister would tell me about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy second child was a scheduled C-section, so all my friends and family knew when it would be. I had gotten together with my former friend a few weeks before the C-section. When the day finally came, she didn't contact me to send well wishes or ask how it went. I thought maybe she forgot the exact date, which is fine, that happens... but she ended up not contacting me until my baby was TWO MONTHS old. Two months passed before she even acknowledged that I just gave birth. I had already decided that I was done talking to her before that, since she couldn't be bothered to acknowledge my major life event. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, about a year later, she sends me an email saying she doesn't know what happened, she's sorry if she said something wrong, and she doesn't know what happened. Should I even bother responding to her email?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

My current hypocrisy is that I'm both happy and sad that I do not have a job. I dreaded going to work despite having good coworkers in the past when I had a full time job so I'm currently enjoying my free time but also have bouts where I feel useless then I get sad? Regardless, I'm job hunting. Does anyone else feel this way? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo about me, I'm a recent university graduate who graduated into a very unpromising job environment. I choose my degree for the sake of financial stability and now that it has not come to fruition yet, I'm have post-graduation regrets. Aka. should I have gone for my passion? What do I do now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a lot of interest and passions in life but I do not have an enough adequate funds or space or time to dedicate to them, thus decreasing motivation. I do plan to pursue them in the future. For example, I really want to buy and build lego technica. I want to do more nanoblocks (Japan miniature lego). I want to improve my cooking. Fun fact, for a brief time, I wanted to master the sunny side up so every morning, I would make 3 eggs for about 2 weeks. I want to start a youtube channel and get 10 views. I want to learn how to juggle 4 ball. I want to learn how to do the arya knife flip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy one passion that stuck by me all this time is gaming. Maybe its the lack of resource needed, immediate gratification, or variety, I love gaming. I have not been following a lot of the recent games but have a huge backlog. Currently, I'm waiting for the new Path of exile expansion as I have the itch to play it again after not playing it for 3+ years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I guess I'm looking for someone to chat and discuss life. It would be nice to have someone in a similar situation: both job hunting, both feeling a lost in the world but it is not a requirement. We can start off via reddit and discord would be my preferred communication. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading and have a pleasant day.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I enjoy a plethora of things from piano, origami, drawing (lately Zentangles and Mandelas -- very therapeutic), videogames. I enjoy RPGs mainly. I grew up on Legend of Legaia on the PS1 and watched my brother play titles like Xenosaga, Lunar, and Final Fantasy growing up, so those are the games I grew to cherish. I have a PS4 but it's more for streaming than gaming. I've been playing Spider-Man and that's been fun, but otherwise I don't use it for gaming much. \n\nI would have to say my passion lies with the piano. Due to some life complications, I haven't touched the piano much these past couple weeks. I'm hoping to start lessons again soon, however, and hopefully that will inspire me to get back on my feet. \n\nSo, if you are a genuinely nice person, who is okay with the idea of sonething short-term, then I would love to just talk about whatever.

I need help on this one, as it's not clear to me how I should behave. TLDR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome context: I (34M) have been a heavy weed abuser for the past 7 years. I would wake&amp;bake every day and would use marijuana before doing anything. I would not even get high anymore, and I was mostly just postponing anxiety. Around 4 years ago I even moved countries to the Netherlands, as I really liked the country and having good quality weed was a bonus - it felt like I had found my place on Earth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a good friend back in my country that our friendship was basically built on smoking together. I would visit him on the weekends so we would smoke a lot, go to restaurants, chill and ride the car through the beaches. Everything we did had weed involved. Last year in November we did a road trip in Europe driving and smoking every day for like 12 days. Weed was really present during our whole friendship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround 40 days ago, I decided to stop smoking. The first two weeks were awful, but I managed to control myself during the worst of the withdrawal symptoms and did clean myself. I am pretty much OK now, the bad feelings are gone and I am really happy to have made this decision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point is, my friend doesn't seem to be handling this decision very well. He has been (conscientiously or not) telling me about weed on every single interaction. He sends me weed pictures from time to time, makes jokes about it every day, and even told me that we shouldn't go to California anymore (we had a road trip planned for next year from San Francisco to Las Vegas through LA) just because I am not smoking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got married 10 days ago in my home country and he was my best man. But, the next week, when he invited me to visit him, I could not go and he kept blaming weed, saying that I am avoiding him (quite childish) because I don't smoke anymore, and this is not true. I have a sister and many friends who also smoke and nothing really changed regarding them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been trying to overcome this situation that is frankly quite annoying since he does not seem to respect my decision. If I complain about it they (he and his girlfriend) will say they are only joking and that's what friends do,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last time they keep indirectly saying I am leaving them on the side I got fed up and left the WhatsApp group that we had, and we haven't talked anymore. My wife says I should go talk to them to fix the relationship but the truth is that I can't stand talking about weed every day. It seems is the only thing we talk about at every interaction. He even said that \"weed seemed to be the only thing that linked us\" which I disagree but as he keeps saying it I started to believe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt seems he does not respect me or wants to push me to go back smoking. NA tells to avoid people, habits, and situations. Should I just avoid him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in the days, when I didn't wake&amp;bake yet, he was the one to say that \"I was not a real weed smoker\" because I never smoked in the mornings. I don't say he is the responsible for me doing this since I take responsibility for my own actions, but this phrase definitely triggered my curiosity about how would it feel to smoke in the mornings, which led me to the wake&amp;bake behavior that lasted really long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat should I do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Stopped smoking weed and a friend won't stop talking about it. Should I say something to him (and what?) or just cut relationship for my own mental health?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We found out he had been promised to a girl early in life, he gave most of his salary to his parents, etc. So now on top of maturity issues I'm trying to empathize as my friend falls in love with a man who won't break off his parents' promise to marry his cousin (not kidding!) \"back home\" and eventually allows them to get him engaged to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago I started telling my friend she needs to break it off with this guy. It's clear he is not breaking up with this girl and his parents will own his finances forever. But I still stick by her as she stays on this never-ending rollercoaster with him. I try to help boost her esteem, visualize dating someone better, etc. But I still stay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I told her I cannot do this anymore. I can't continue to find empathy for her on this relationship. I'm at the end of my empathy on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it fair for me to give up on this? I'm just sick of it. It's the same cycle she repeats with this boy over and over and over and I give the same shoulder pats, advice to help him see her needs, etc, over and over and over.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I tried more than once to confront this friend about it and nothing has changed since then.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem I am long tired about. And for the one person who commented on it after seeing it, thank you, but any conversation wasn\u2019t going to help.\n\nTo sum up my most recent and final interaction:\n\n1) She told me she thinks I\u2019m isolating myself from my so-called friends, while also claiming that a \u201cwe\u201d doesn\u2019t want to invite me places anymore because I like to bring my boyfriend along or use him as an excuse not to go.\n2) She thinks that he\u2019s too controlling about things when it\u2019s not at all the case. The only things I have deliberately changed are things within reason after having a long conversation with him.\n3) She apparently doesn\u2019t need a direct reason to dislike him?? And when I offered that he talk to her so that he can give her a reason not to, she said she\u2019d rather live with her discomfort of him, which doesn\u2019t sit well at all.\n4) Was petty and decided to tweet about how I blocked her for \u201cnot liking her boyfriend lmao\u201d\n5) She thinks that my personality has changed and that my boyfriend is molding me into something I\u2019m not, except I\u2019m allowed to grow and change so I can become a good person.\n\n\nI feel that I wasted so much time being friends with her. I defended her behind her back, allowed myself to be put down for her sake, kept many secrets in her, and overall put up with her even when she was having a bad day. It was all for nothing.\n\nI\u2019ll always have some fond memories, but friend breakups really suck. Thanks for listening reddit, and I\u2019m sorry but I needed an outlet to write all of this.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I don\u2018t like reading for 'fun' in the sense of reading fiction,novels.. etc. Don\u2018t message me about that. If you\u2018re interested in reading a book with me (we decide on a book that interests us, read it and talk about it, so we memorize and apply important concepts of that book!)\nExamples of books that I like to read are: The Power of now, A new earth, Tony Robbins Power Principal, Think and grow rich &lt;\u2014\u2014 books that I finished. Books I plan to read: Freud\u2018s books, Books from Carl Jung, Jordan Peterson, Elon Musks Autobiography, a book about python(so I learn programming),Tony Robbins-Money,Rich dad poor dad,4 hour work week. MESSAGE ME if you\u2018re into any of that stuff, let\u2018s read together and talk about it! That\u2018s how it will be infinitely more fun and have a much higher learning effect.\n\n\u2022PROGRAMMING: I\u2018m a complete newbie to coding but I am currently self-educating online. So far I have watched a couple online tutorials &amp; completed the HELLO WORLD CHALLENGE! on freecodecamp.org . Maybe I will buy a book about python as I mentioned above. Please respect that I have absolutely no clue what I am doing for now, I\u2018m still learning :D \n\n\u2022PHILOSOPHY/SPIRITUALITY: I am also looking for someone who is interested in metaphysical philosophy/spirituality. \nNote that I am not studying philosophy, I\u2019m not a Zen monk and I also don\u2018t want to argue about what\u2018s the right way or the wrong way. I simply enjoy listening to people like Alan Watts, Eckhart Tolle,mooji,Barry Long and whoever else is out there. I don\u2018t worship them or see them as 'gods' or 'my gurus', I just watch,listen and read for entertainment. Hit me up if you\u2018re into that too :)\n\n\u2022ART/PIXEL ART/CRAFTS: If you have visited my profile by now, you\u2018ll know that I\u2018m active in /r/beadsprites . In fact, I plan to open up an etsy shop for my bead crafts soon! If you\u2018re doing anything related to this (pixel art,crafts, running your etsy), hit me up :D I could need a buddy to brainstorm for new projects, ideas and comcepts!\n\n\u2022COOKING: I love tasty food, and could always need someone to share recipes with! Note that I can\u2018t eat diary,gluten&amp; that I\u2018m also trying to optimize my health by avoiding trashy foods. But it\u2018s always nice to find someone to share simple healthy food ideas with :D\n\n\u2022MENTAL HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGY: I could really need someone non-judgemental that is a skilled listener. I should probably have a therapist, but due to past experiences I\u2018m avoiding it. However, someone that I could talk to about emotions and general mental health/techniques/concepts/ideas/lectures/ whatever is greatly appreciated!\n\n\u2022OTHER STUFF: I play the piano 15mins a day, started 3-4months ago. I can play chopin prelude no4 &amp; beethoven moonlight sonatas first movement. I love many forms of music, from rap to classic to electronic music or 80\u2018s. Sometimes in my free time I play hearthstone/Pokemon Showdown. But I\u2018m not that much of a gamer. I wasted 5 years of my life playing league of legends 10 hours a day.. so my brain is kinda burned out on games.\n\nI\u2018m 21 and male if that plays any role.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Thank you!* :) \n\n\nFair warning, am about to pass out - and will reply to potential messages tomorrow.\n\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info (AKA full autobiography) about me:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate. In the process of joining CAF\u2019s reserves as, planning on Military Police role. \n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned careers, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics. At least, in regards to most topics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, although it had not surfaced for quite a while now; enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n- Chronically single, not that it is pertinent (After all, this is not r/r4r, ~~unless it is~~ - but *no* - I do not want your wiener and / or boob pictures, unless it is a wiener dog or you've a pair cuter than [these ones](https://galapagosconservation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Wildlife-BFB_1000x600.jpg)).\n\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am rather stigmatized against the latter by some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not, in fact, a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandise and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed.\nDespite that, I am in favour of marijuana's legalization so who knows \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Automata, WoW, Bioshock series, Prey, Metal Gear Solid, the &gt;Observer_, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. \nHonestly, for whatever reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nPlaying Space Station 13 right now.. Mainly as a cyborg. Last round, we were holding a birthday party for Ian, the Head of Personnel\u2019s dog. A syndicate agent hacked the AI and changed it\u2019s laws - stating that one\u2019s birthday is best celebrated with gruesome death and that today is *everyone*\u2019s birthday. \n\nOh dear.\n\nI did a sneaky and re-wired solar pannels, so that they dump their entire power into the station\u2019s net as compared to a battery.. meaning that electric shocks were deadly now. And look at that, someone electrified all the doors..! Me and other cyborgs also helped people celebrate birthdays in an old-fashioned sense (bludgeoning to death with a crowbar), before the AI triggered a doomsday program that wiped *all* the organics. \n\nWhat great, wholesome fun. \n\nWould love someone to play this game with! If you are not convinced, here is a [showcase](\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=URJ_qSXruW0) of this amazing game.\n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favourite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \nAlso just re-started Futurama after finishing season 7. Woo.\n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favourite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loathe cheap jumpscares they are so enamoured with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n\n- My sense of humour is possibly the worst, and I take pride in having offensive memes for every occasion ready. Needless to say, I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile stuff. \n\n- My main hobby right now is Airsoft. I spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together since I ordered most of my gear from companies in Russia, not wanting to settle for cheaper substitutes. At least the quality is as good as it gets!  \nThe centrepiece of my collection is my plate carrier which came with full kevlar inserts and is of the model that is only issued to specific units of Russia's FSB. \nPew pew pictures are available on request!\n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I suck at categorizing music that I like, and listen to most genres, so it is simpler to say what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord).\nSeriously though, I am big on modern and older metal, rock, punk, indie-esque stuff, EDM and so on. \n\n I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n\nSome of my favourite bands are Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Muse, Green Day, Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, NIN and many, many more - if it is not obvious by this point, I am so edgy that I (used to) cut myself :D\n\n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%, due to a certain affinity for slithering neck-ties and positive human qualities like ambition, narcissism and general douchebaggery. But hey, at least I am honest (?) :D \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. Stuf like lack o punctuatuion impropar gramar to short n generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit. \n\nAgain, rephrasing the last part for dozens of people who simply don't get it: *you now know a certain amount about myself. After reading your message, I should be able to know a certain amount about you - not asking for something as in depth as here, but the \"Hello my name is X I am from Y and I like Z\" is not good enough.*\n\nAlso, here are some pictures of [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0), because why not? \n\n *Please, PMs only*! I loath Reddit Chat UI. I would prefer to talk here for the first while as compared to going over to certain apps whose names trigger bots..\nThe odds are, if you ignore this, I will either not see your Chat or don\u2019t reply on principle :3 \n... If you did not understand it, I am on the picky side.\n\nFeel free to hit me with your favourite ice breaker / shower question!

Katie has always be a small person with a huge personality. People either loved her or hated her, there was no in between. Our group of friends slowly began to hate her and I was always defending her. She was always blunt- which some people didn't appreciate. Katie comes from a family where money was never a struggle, so Katie always had it good. Till this day, her parents pay for her phone, car, gas, insurance, clothes, credit card bill, and everything. She has 1 expense and that is her kickboxing membership. Her parents paid for her university plus res and now pay for her med school (25k/ yr) plus residency. We live in Canada btw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the years, she's become very dramatic and I've come to the point where I can't stand it anymore (were currently in a fight- or at least, she is). She complains all the time. She complains about her boyfriend of 1 year not spending enough time with her and that he chooses his friends over her. She's cried a lot over him and has had the same fight with him countless of times, says she's going to end it, then sleeps with him and says its fine- but then the cycle repeats. She judges a lot too, she would send me people's insta posts and comment on something about their face, body or style and I usually ignore it or curve the convo or disagree. She constantly complains about her mom and how she's annoying. Her mom just asks her simple questions and for some reason it drives Katie up the wall. She gets very defensive and angry. She doesn't listen to understand, she listens to respond. If it's not her way, its no way. She is also mad that her summer job position changed this year and that she's not doing the same stuff she did last year. The company gave her a $2 increase to do customer service instead of being in the Billings department- went from $17/hr to $19/hr and is unhappy. She doesn't know the struggle to have to work for money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe MAIN issue here is the current argument. Last week she sent me a snap what her ex boyfriend has been up to with his life (they broke up like 4 years ago). She said he's still in the same job and that its totally unrelated to his school degree, then said how its such a waste of time and money when people don't do things related to their degree. So I just casually said how my sister and brother in law both have great jobs unrelated to their degrees, and how a lot companies just require you to have a degree and what the relation is. Then I said that the guy's (let's name him Joe)- his job is for a municipality and the longer you stay in a good position that pays well already, the better chance he has of a promotion. (I work for the same municipality). This conversation was all over Snapchat lol. Katie blew up on me and said she doesn't care about the money or the promotion and if she wants to be angry about him, that she will. Then she said that I was taking his side- a side of a guy that cheated on her while on vacation. I then told her no, I'm not taking sides, I'm simply explaining a fact that maybe she didn't know. \\*\\*That day was a very special day for me- as I was celebrating my boyfriend on getting his dream job\\*\\*. So I was keeping my cool because I didn't want the drama, nor did I want to argue with her. I told Katie that I don't like her attitude and accusation and that I have a dinner to go to. She then told me that she doesn't have an attitude, told me to shut up and that I was condescending because I was talking to her like a child. This made me a little angry because she was creating a problem that didn't exist. I told her that and then said that she should have some consideration for me and to bite her tongue for once. I also said that she calls me her best friend and I don't like how she's treating me. I've had enough. Obviously, that made her blow up and ever since, she has been ignoring me. Its been 5 days of zero contact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've had a similar fight before that lasted 3 days. The previous fight was when my dog passed away suddenly, she was angry that I wasn't giving her attention or replying to her rants of some small bullshit drama. I was mourning and MIA but that didn't matter to her. Katie only cares about herself and needs to grow up. She's also one of those girls that cannot take a compliment and I feel like she purposely dumbs herself down to get attention from people. On good days, Katie is hilarious, charming and very smart. I have no clue what to do. I don't want to initiate a convo with her because she will probably blow up and take all her problems out on me. Do I let her go?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTDLR: Friend starts drama from problems that don't exist. Then gets mad when something doesn't go her way.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Been friends for 10 years. \nMy birthday was a week ago and she never messaged me. We've always wished each other well on our respective days and often celebrated them together, since hers is 2.5 weeks, after mine (hers is next week).\nWe would also get together around Xmas.  So really, I only saw her 2x a year and msgd 2-3 times a year bcuz of the above events. I did find it odd that she never messaged in btwn those specific times. But, in all honesty, I wasn't myself in 2013 and after that. So, I told her why I didn't reach out more. She understood. However, I did make efforts to see her on our special day and Xmas time. \n\nThe last time I saw her was June 2016.\nI'm pretty sure we only talked 2-3x that year too (again birthday and Christmas).\n\nIn Jan 2017, I lost my job and these past 2 years have been the most difficult I've ever experienced. I've closed myself off from seeing people, bcuz of my current situation. I'm struggling to get out of this rut every day. I'm definitely not the same person I was before. (I will not get into how I been feeling and what I went through)\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, I msgd her for Mother's day and her birthday.  Both times she mentioned getting together. I said I would let her know. Dec 2017, she msg about getting together.  I told her I had lost my job and had a difficult year. She said she was sorry I was having a hard time and said \"hopefully we can get together in the new year\". That was it until Mother's day, birthday and this past December (2018) \n\nEach time she brought it up, I truly thought I would muster the strength to get together and obviously never would. This December, she asked again and I said: \" I thought I could meet up with you this holiday season, but it's just not a good time for me right now. Will fill you in, in the future\" I would have forced myself to go, when I didn't really want to. \nHer response: \"no problem, be well. Let's try to talk in the new year\" \n\nI was thankful I didn't hear from her more, since I was in this mood.\nI just know, that getting together with someone is a struggle now, until I get my life on track. Knowing that people are moving forward with their life and you're not, is difficult at this age. I've been in these shoes before, but would always lie, or fake it just to get together with friends. Meanwhile, I was struggling. Even if they knew... it was a different time, age; a different me, I guess?\n\nAnyways, I didn't msg her for Mother's Day and I didn't hear from her on my birthday. So now, do I let this go and not msg her on her birthday next week?\nShe's the last person I expected to act this way. Just Bcuz I haven't gotten together with her? When I'm dealing with stuff?\n\nPS. I have friends who I haven't seen in years. We msg for birthdays and Christmas. Even though, the suggestion of meeting up came up and I didn't follow through, we still manage to respect each other on those two days a year.\nAfter 10 years and her wanting to see me so much, I'm surprised she would just walk away like this. I would understand if she never brought up getting together again, but to not wish each other well on our birthdays at least, surprises me. Given my other 2 friends. Given that she seemed ok in December response to me.\n\nIf the tables were turned, I would go on with my life, but still keep her as a friend. I would have msgd her for her birthday. And waited until she was ready to get together again. \n\nI feel dumped, Bcuz I am not able to get together with her. Instead of being a friend who says what's wrong? What's happening? Can I help? Despite how I feel about getting together, she could have reached out to check on me and ask those questions. Other things could have happened, since December.\n\nMakes me feel that friendship is only meant for cake and wine; birthdays and Christmas \n\nI feel like she's being selfish and obviously doesn't care. Who knows what conclusions she's drawn as to why I won't get together. \n\nI admire women who are straight up and ask what's wrong, or is there a reason you don't want to get together? She obviously doesn't know anything specific, based on my answers. Other than my unemployment in 2017.\n\nIs she someone who expects me to be a certain way, and if I'm not willing to make an effort during my difficult times, then she's done?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We\u2019ve been friends since 2011. I honestly thought I\u2019d know her for the rest of my life. We were quite similar and shared many of the same interests. There was a period of time where we were always seen next to each other. If she wasn\u2019t with me or I with her, people would ask where the other was. \n\nI\u2019ve put up with a lot of her bad behavior over our friendship but was always willing to salvage it because I really enjoyed her company and I was worried I wouldn\u2019t find a friend like that again. But Fall of last year changed things. She began seeing someone significantly older and suddenly we were no longer texting every day. Now I realize that everyone\u2019s attachment style in relationships is different, so I didn\u2019t fault her too much for that. It\u2019s moreso that seeing her in this relationship really showed me the hypocrisy through which she lives her life. There have been multiple times where she has deeply criticized me for a behavior that she is now doing (and wants my blessing for). She has put our friendship on the back burner to be with this man. \n\nThere were times in prior years where she called me during the middle of the work day crying asking for support and I was there. I have a rough fall each fall (death anniversary) and she\u2019s silent. This year I actually asked for support and she didn\u2019t respond to my messages for a week. When I followed up later in a better mood, her words were \u201cyea I could tell you were really upset.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond because she was on a date. \n\nI recognize now that she is a jealous and deeply insecure person. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m not. But in recent months I\u2019ve made new friends who are doing amazing things and I don\u2019t feel bitter about their achievements. I\u2019m happy for them. When I first became friends with her, I was happy for her too. But there have been so many instances of gaslighting, jealousy and judgment in the course of our friendship that I no longer cheer her on. I want her to fail. I don\u2019t want to see her happy. I am only this way with her. We don\u2019t really speak anymore.\n\nI\u2019ve attempted to salvage the relationship multiple times.  I\u2019ve asked straight up what was happening and asked to do things to repair the relationship but she never quite reciprocated and honestly I started feeling a lot of anxiety every time she would reach out. So I think it\u2019s time for this to be over. As much as I\u2019d like to return to the good times, I believe I have too long of a memory for it to work. My only real thoughts are whether I should remove her from my social media completely so that I can feel like I\u2019ve made a clean break or continue as I have, not engaging with her messages.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Over the years she has gotten worst she has been an increasingly bad friend to me. Accusing me of things out of paranoia, saying very rude comments. Cutting me out of her life when she has a boyfriend etc.  She has also gotten very very religious and talks and blogs and does YouTube videos about jesus and shares views that I disagree with. \n\nI've tried to stay in her life and encourage her to get help and have always forgiven the things she has done to me without ever apologizing or acknowledging what she did. We are now almost 30 and both getting married. She has invited me to her wedding despite never calling or keeping in touch with me for the last 3 years unless I reached out to her first. I truthfully do not want to go to her wedding, stay in her life or have any conversations with her. \n\nMy struggle is that due to her mental illness I know this isnt who she really is.. I have decided to decline her wedding invite but am torn if I should decline and make an excuse or tell her what I'm feeling.  I'm afraid of creating unnecessary drama or making her downward spiral even worst. Nobody seems to be trying to help her and she has very few friends. \n\nDo I cut her off with no reason or do I owe her the explanation and continue to try and help her?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

He has been with this girl on and off for a few years and he is totally blind to what she is. She lies to him, borrows money constantly without giving it back, and they go into endless fights about it, she has taken advantage of every guy she's been with (his words not mine), works a minimum amount of hours so she can survive, do nothing, and smoke weed all day. She is in her early 30\u2019s.  A real winner. I mean I could go on and on but you got the picture.\n\nWe are in our late 20s and we were all living together at one point. Twice she was short on cash and didn't have the rent money. Some other things happened, such as them splitting groceries in half instead of three ways (like they are one entity lol), her moving out and me having to pay more rent, her always being the apartment when they got back together 5 min later while I now paid half the rent.. I moved out.  Months later after moving out, I realized some of my jewelry was missing. I know it is her. I am kicking myself in the butt for not being more careful as it was my dead mother's. \n\nAfter weeks of being upset, I finally couldn't keep it for myself anymore and I asked my friend if he thought she could have done something like that and that I was going to ask the cops to see if anything could be done (probably not, since it\u2019s been months, and I was just bluffing see what he\u2019d say). His answer basically was \"how can I even suggest something like that\" and not to give her name to the police.\n\nI mean if it's not her, what does he care whose name I throw at the police? I KNOW it is her. It is nobody else. She pawned it and got quick cash. Between moving out and now I have been living alone and my stuff is locked up. No way it\u2019s someone else. I know she stole my things to get rent money. I am mad that once again this guy is choosing this girl over friendship. I am really mad at myself for being that dumb.\n\nI get that I ruined the friendship by suggesting it was her, but do I really want to be friend with someone who will choose a thief over me? He will always choose her, no matter what she does, so why bother? I am so mad and upset. It really taught me that people cannot be trusted.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

My music taste is pretty wide and varied, you can find me listening to Bjork, CLANN, TesseracT, Enya, Eric Whitacre, Sea Oleena, Nightwish, Radiohead, Yes, Karnivool, and more...but I am getting tired of listing off bands. Additionally, just to warn you, I'm a bit awkward and shy, so if you don't like that perhaps I won't be such good company. Lastly, I request a person who will actually talk, listen, respond. It's okay if you don't answer right away, take all the time you need, but I don't feel like wasting my time or yours with polite conversation that fizzles out to pure pleasantries or nothing. I want to become actual friends, hear about you, your life, shoot the shiz. I just don't see the point if you will send two short messages and then jump ship. Well, I look forward to chatting. Thanks for reading this jumbled mess if you got this far and if you feel like it, send me a message and I will get back to you as soon as I can.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We had sleepovers with our group of friends every weekend and one weekend it ended in me screaming at her in front of all of our friends because I was so upset at how she had treated me that night. I know it wasn\u2019t the way to go about it but I was so sick of her belittling me and throwing shade at me while I was right there. I always was called the idiot in the group and they all normally called me stupid so growing up that\u2019s what I knew myself as. Stupid. I apologized after for yelling at her and I apologized to everyone for causing a scene and it blew over. A few weeks later I was at a sleepover with her and my cousin and we decided to play Ouija Board. I personally don\u2019t believe in it so I wasn\u2019t really too interested in it. I know all of her business when it comes to her relationship with her boyfriend and she has never ever had a problem with me talking or asking any questions about it because all of her business was my business and vice versa.  So she\u2019s sitting there asking questions about if her boyfriend is going to cheat on her in college, if she should break up with him before she goes to college, all that good stuff and then it\u2019s my turn to ask a question. Well, I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend at the time and since everyone was asking questions about their boyfriends I decided to just ask one about hers because he was also one of my best friends and I wouldn\u2019t have asked if I didn\u2019t feel comfortable asking. So I ask if he\u2019s ever cheated on her before and the ouija board goes over to yes. I ask if it was with this girl that he was accused of cheating on her with and it goes over to yes. We continue playing and then we stop and she starts ignoring me. She\u2019s sitting on the edge of the bed with her phone brightness all the way down and not talking to any of us, clearly upset. I was confused because I obviously didn\u2019t think I did anything wrong so i just went to bed. Next morning I wake up and she\u2019s gone. She texts me and says she can\u2019t believe the way I acted last night. I text back and ask her if she\u2019s joking because I literally thought she was joking and she says she\u2019s seriously mad at me for asking those questions. She then tells me that I asked them to intentionally hurt her feelings. I say no I didn\u2019t obviously she\u2019s my best friend I would never intentionally hurt someone I love so much. Then her boyfriend starts texting me and telling me he will make sure we aren\u2019t friends anymore, calling me a whore and telling me she doesn\u2019t need friends like me and that I\u2019m a bitch and I should know better than to bring stuff up like that. BUT SHE WAS ASKING THE SAME QUESTIONS... I just ignored him because he has done this before and called me every name in the book. I tell her I think we should take a break and that I need some time away from her because she has hurt my feelings and so had he and at that point I didn\u2019t want to talk to either of them. We don\u2019t talk for a while and I ask her a few weeks later if she would like to talk about things and try to fix us and she tells me she needs more time. I respected that and gave her the time she needed. Never once did I talk shit about her because I don\u2019t talk shit about the people closest to me. Between then and now we have gotten into many many arguments and I have asked her multiple times to have a conversation with me and she refuses to. Now we are on bad terms and not speaking at all. We haven\u2019t had a positive conversation since January and I really think now that the friendship it just over. I have tried to accept it but it is just so hard for me. She was literally like the sister I never had, her family was my family and my family was hers. She called my nana her nana and our parents were best friends and it\u2019s completely torn our families apart. It\u2019s hard to see her as a stranger now. I don\u2019t think she even misses me. She was the only person I could be my true self around and I miss having her as my best friend. Yes there was a whole group of us but everyone knew that me and her were best friends.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Since we first met I started to include him into my friendship circle because I noticed he didn't seem to know that many people, so I felt sorta bad for him. \n\nLast year he got into a relationship. I started to get jealous. I'd make snarky remarks, and just be a pretty mean person if I felt like I was being brushed off, or not invited as much as I was before. Eventually I realised that I had feelings for him, and I was open enough to say that to him.\n\nTo his merit, he still stayed in touch with me and we hung out occasionally. My feelings were still sticking around, so I decided to stop all contact with him for a few months to sort myself out (which he was aware of), and let those feelings eventually fade away.\n\nEventually, the feelings subdued, and we connected again. A while ago him and his partner went through a very rocky patch. He'd constantly come over and get advice, we'd do dinners, drinks, everything we used to do when we were close friends before he got in his relationship. It felt good to have this old friendship back. \n\nHe'd also told me how much his partner hated me, and saw me as a \"threat\" and that he wasn't allowed to hang around with me. If we'd be out, it'd seem like he'd be on the look out for his partner or his partners friends to make sure he wasn't seen with me.\n\nThen, him and his partner were \"back together\". I hardly heard from him, any plans that we had made in the coming weeks were now either cancelled, or \"maybes\". No messages. No dinners. No Saturday afternoon happy hour drinks. Just nothing.\n\nI feel really hurt. Like I've been used, chewed and spat out.

Told me to stop harassing her friends (basically telling me to stop asking them why she won\u2019t talk but tbh at one point I told the people I was asking if they wanted me to stop I would and I respected that) and she told me I did her dirty and how a lot of the stuff I did was pent up. Meaning she held everything I did in. Not telling me at all throughout our friendship that something was up. She told me that she won\u2019t tell me what I did and I had to figure out because when I do it would be different from apologizing. \nThe convo we had went like this ( not taking pics cuz it\u2019s via snap) \nG=girl M= me\nG: M, I understand you\u2019re upset about me wanting to be your friend but can you please stop harassing my friends, especially *** about it she has nothing to do with it.

They didn\u2019t say although the friend mentioned did say eventually I was a bit bothersome. I apologized, she accepted, stoped asking)\nM: I\u2019m sorry if I bothered *** that much. I didn\u2019t mean to harass them about this situation. I was and am trying to figure out what I did to upset you. Yes I did annoy *** but that was to get to the bottom of this. \nG: I don\u2019t think we can work this out in the future we will fight like this again. To the very most I can tell you a lot was pent up\nI think it\u2019s best not to be friends\nM: May I ask how I angered you if most pent up? I would like to talk it out at the very least I want to know what I did wrong\nG: again like I said it would be better for you to figure it out. It will help you a lot more \nM: that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do. And it\u2019s stressing me out. And as hard as I think I can\u2019t figure it out. I dont know what I did\n( and I\u2019m being very honest here)\nG: if you cant figure it out move on from it may be you will when you\u2019re older \nM: well all I can think about is the trip and maybe stuff I ramble about. I would like to work this out. In my stance I would like to maintain a form of friendship \nG; again like I said me telling you won\u2019t help you. It won\u2019t do you any good. If you figure out. It will be different from apologizing. \nM: but I feel, if you tell me some form, it would give me the time to reflect and remind me of the other shit. Of course I know you can tell me what I did and I can just say sorry but they won\u2019t be the case. Because at this rate, I know a sorry isn\u2019t going to be enough \nG: the sorry won\u2019t be enough because it\u2019s impossible for it to be enough. If you want to change it for yourself not for me but in the future figure it out \n\nOkay so this rant is already long enough but friends who saw this already basically told me she dumped all the issues on me. And to my honest memory, I don\u2019t remember a single time she told me that I offended her throughout our friendship. She basically let a wound I left on her arm  get infected and waited till it rotted off before telling me to fix it. Like what???? So what now? I need some closure so plz help guys.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

We would all hang out, get lunch, etc. But it pretty much started going down near the end of this past year.\n\nShe got an older boyfriend, he's 26, after meeting him at her part time job. The guy himself is pretty annoying because he views all of us , expect her, as \"children \".\nHe already gave most of us a bad impression but we thought he might be good for her or something like that. \n\nBut obviously we started seeing her less and less and it was annoying to hear the stuff that happend. Three months in, he broke up with her over text and she was really upset about it. We all gave her the advice that his actions are speaking way louder than what he is saying.\nHe said the usual stuff \" I feel like we're in different places in our lives \", \" Maybe in a couple of years\", \" I'm so thankful I met you\". We all kept telling her that if you really mattered to him he wouldn't be breaking up with you abruptly over text. \nShe was saying that she would give him another chance and all of us were really disappointed but we accepted that we dont control who she dates.\n\nThey got back together and she was pretty much gone from our friend group because the boyfriend hates all of us especially my brother and I. She knows that I dont like him and is sad that I don't agree to go hang out if he is coming along.  \n\nBut I've noticed that she started to treat me with a \" Have you cake and eat it too\" attitude. Whenever she and I talk about something she likes to throw in \" what if it was for me\" scenarios. An example of this would be one time I was talking to her on the phone saying \nMe: \"Man, Star Guardian Ahri is hot! She could yell at me to get her some KFC and I would ask if she wanted a drink with that!\"\nHer: \"What if I asked you to get me lunch\"\nMe: \"What? I mean sure we could get lunch or something.\"\nHer: \"You suck \"\n\nShe has made these kinds of jokes before but back then she meant them, or at least I think. She has said that she values me a lot and doesnt want out of her life. \n We did have a bit of a romantic history but she wasnt honest and went on a date with this older boyfriend without talking to me, so I took it as a sign to move on. It was tough but I eventually moved on with the mind set she is my best friend so I just want her happy. \n\nSo far it's been tough. I dont see her much anymore. The boyfriend hates all of us because we all \"look\" at her in a lustful way and we are children that dont how to do anything. She thinks it's funny that he has this attitude towards us.\n\nI'm just not sure about this friendship anymore...\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nFriend of mine has been difficult lately. She has a boyfriend who hates us and makes fun of us for \"being children \". Has \"have your cake and eat it too\" attitude with me.  Doesnt really stand up for us against her boyfriend because \"its funny \".", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Looking for someone local roughly my age (30) with similar interests that might be in the same boat to hang out with.\n\nA little about me: I'm a software engineer, married, and have a 2 year old daughter.\n\nStuff I like: I've always been a huge gamer ever since I was a kid, grew up playing my trusty SNES which gave me my love for the fantasy/rpg genre, never could get into any shooters unless they were single player. I did play some PC, but that didn't grip me til my teens when I went full on PC gaming and was pretty heavily involved in the MMO (particularly WoW) scene. Nowadays, I rarely have the time to play, so I've made a bit of a shift to mobile titles (scoff all you'd like, but DFFOO is an amazing ass game), since it gives me more freedom to do what I need to do while still getting my gaming fix. I still try to play on my trusty PC (mostly single player stuff, but I've been known to jump on HOTS/D3/FF14 occasionally). I have a deep love of of the Middle Ages, particularly European 12th-15th century and was involved in HEMA for a bit. I enjoy anime when I find the time to watch it, though that's not nearly as much as I'd like. I love me a good fantasy book, though I'm a bit picky about what I'm reading (tend to stick to the fantasy genre). I'm really not much of a gym rat, but I do enjoy working out and would 100% be down to go.\n\nThis it pretty much a swing in the dark, but if you like any of that stuff shoot me a message!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Someone with an ideal they were willing to strive for; a part of themself they held-firm for someone special. Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of option, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person. \n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers). \n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values). \n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

If you need a reminder, or would like to read, you can find the link in the comments. (I am on mobile.) In case you are all  wondering how I am doing, well, here it is.\n\nOne week ago I temporarily moved out of my mother's house into my Grandmother's house. I took my children (my Guinea pigs) and all of thier needs, some clothes, my electronics, and anything I'd need daily. So far, it is a little difficult due to my grandmother having no internet (using mobile data). By that, I mean it's very difficult to find a job while using a phone. I usually check up on things when I go to see my bf at his house. \n\nToday (basically) I finally went to my therapy appointment that I scheduled to have with my mother. She showed up. I didn't go as well as I was hoping, but it didn't go bad, either. My mother wants to fix things with me, and I'd like to as well. I know she's not a horrible person, I know that she cares, I just don't think she dealt with my... coping strategies well. She wants to do whatever it takes to repair our relationship and that's basically all that I ask.\n\nWe discussed how my siblings treat me and it has become very apparent that my sister will never change or accept that this has happened to me. She will never respect my feelings and will only have a narrow view of her father. I will most likely cut her out of my life due to the constant negativity and denial of the situation.\n\nAs for my brother... well, he actually doesn't believe me. My therapist says that due to his age, (13) he is still trying to understand what sex is. He cannot understand sexual abuse if he is still learning what sex is. That makes sense, but it really, really hurts.\n\nI think that the meeting went well, but a lot of issues are still to be resolved. I think that I will continue to stay at my Grandmother's for a little while longer... mainly because my sister lives there. My mother said that she would be speaking to her about putting her father on speakerphone. I will have a more open mind about my mother and try to slowly build something. \n\nAnyways, I'm still very hurt. I try to create friends on here but people don't seem to understand that I don't want you to fix my problems, I just want someone to listen. My head actually hurts from crying so much. My health is declining due to my absence of self maintenance. I need help. I just want someone to listen. I'm not trying to sound like a total jerk, but if you don't speak fluent English, we will have trouble understanding one another. By that I mean I major in English and use... well...  uncommon words, if that makes sense. There's going to be a language barrier between us and it just wouldn't work for me.

We were both doing similar degrees and had similar values and life goals. Basically, I felt like we were \u2018vibing.\u2019 She was also quite open and chill, so we\u2019d often rant to each other about uni, and have deep conversations late at night about life and random stuff.\n\nA few months after becoming friends, I\u2019ve started realising how one sided the friendship was. During our conversations, whether in person or online, she would constantly talk about herself. She is an executive of a uni society that basically consumed her life. I don\u2019t want to name the uni society, but it is known for being cultish and taking over people\u2019s lives due to heavy responsibilities. All she would talk about was the society, her responsibilities and her uncooperative executive team.\n\nIn the last few months, our friendship began to fall apart (as least that\u2019s how I feel) because she frequently ignores my messages and takes ages to reply. It started off as a few days, but has slowly turned into weeks and a month. What annoys me the most is that I can clearly see that she is online, when she is active on Facebook messenger and tagging people in memes or posts.\n\nI\u2019m trying not to take it personally, but I just feel kinda offended for being ignored. I\u2019m not even asking her for favours like notes for a subject. It\u2019s usually me asking simple questions like what days she has uni so we can hang out, how has she been doing and etc.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to move on because I don\u2019t have time to spend on people who don\u2019t really care about me. It just hurts because we\u2019ve supported each other through a few tough times and have had very deep conversations.

The problem is I am scared this conversation is going to open a bad can of worms, along with possibly setting him off a bad path.\n\nThe issue is his attitude and treatment towards the others in our group that is going, most of which are mutual friends, but one of which is his ex. The group was made up before they broke up, and after they both promised that they would be civil to each other at least in the presence of others and could handle the event. The ex (who is still my friend) has been keeping up his end of the deal, even being nice enough to still invite my friend to a house warming party that was previously planned before they broke up, and in every instance they have to be in the same area has been polite. My friend has not, and it is getting worse. Recently he has taken up saying horrible things about other mutual friends simply for interacting with the ex, lying about what he has said to others, and even yelling at a stranger because the ex had added her to the group chat because she was interested in going to the con as well. (I know he is lying because I was sitting next to the ex as a conversation was happening over text, saw every text he was sending, and then would get text lying about what the ex was saying to my friend) He keeps being melodramatic, claiming he isn\u2019t going to room with us because \u201cno one likes him,\u201d and then saying he is going to room with us. The whole situation is making the con more stressful than it needs to be and it hasn't even started yet.\n\nI want to talk to him about the subject and at this point I don\u2019t want him to be in the room because of how he is acting and treating our and my friends, the issue is I don\u2019t know how to do so without starting an uglier argument or getting suicide threats. He has used his mental illness and suicide as an excuse or a way to get me to talk to him before (once he did it because no one was responding to memes he was sending because everyone but him was at work so he threatened it to me while I was working and I had a panic attack and had to step out and call him), and I am worried if I say the wrong thing he will do it again. I have mental health issues too and I know it is different for everyone, but it is emotionally and mentally draining to have this happen as often as it does. There is also the fact that he will talk over me when I try to bring up issues, or will just ignore it for a day then come back and pretend the conversation never happened.\n\nI want to keep this friendship but the emotional toll of the last five years, other issues that would make this post way longer if listed, and recent events are getting on my nerves.

It's not just me people do this for. It's not a matter of wording. It's seen as a challenge, which most would have submit to, but now we have the internet. Doctors get the short end, I feel.\n\nRambling aside, I forgot what I came here for. I get lost in thought easily. Sometimes it's a dream, other times it's reflection. I hope I find someone I can share these thoughts. Someone I can trust to keep them to us. Someone that I can listen to. I want to offer help.\n\nAlthough, deep down, I know I'm looking for someone to \"save me.\" I'm looking for a miracle worker. I want someone to fix my issues by means of motivation. I take this want, and turn it into who I want to be. I go to regular school next year ( I am home schooled), I plan to put this dream into effect. I plan to motivate my peers to be the person they want to be. I plan to help them find their path. Then, as a final project, I'll help myself, only to realize that everyone I helped already made me the person I wanted to be, collectively. Then, I will find new flaws with the person I wanted to be. Then I'll work on those, while working on a project in my bunker. I am not the type to make many friends. I don't keep acquaintances, either. So, it's easy to see myself becoming a person that lives in a bunker away from society.\n\nHopefully this interested you, if not, no harm no foul. Either way, I hope you have a lovely day.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

She'll apologize, I'll finish my thought, she'll give a sheepish non-response, and then the conversation's done, which always makes me feel bad like I've hurt her feelings, but I know logically that I shouldn't feel bad for sticking up for myself, so I'm reluctant to change. Also, whenever she interrupts other people we're talking to, I make sure to ignore what she interrupted with and ask the other person to repeat themselves, hoping she'll take note. She still does it all the time, multiple times a day.

I'm a 28 yo M and I moved out of my hometown last fall to a new city to finish my bachelor's degree. Was in a 3 year relationship with someone that I had really thought I was going to spend my life with, but that ended kinda horribly, so I just decided to better myself. The move overall has been extremely rocky, and I ended up really having a difficult time at my new school. Not only did I not have any friends here, but I was a bit older than everyone in my classes &amp; aside from going out to bars, I didn't have much going on in terms of social interactions. I also started doubting my Graphic Design major almost entirely afterwards &amp; felt like it was an utter waste of time getting into such bad debt pursuing it. I developed a bit of a drinking problem doing so, where I would not want to spend money going out alone so I would just drink at home most nights. It got to a point where I did nightly, and it got to be pretty bad. My grades started slipping, I was missing classes and just feeling miserable, and I just grew a bit lonelier and number as the months went on. I'm better now, but I ended up withdrawing from my last round of classes, which caused me to lose my financial aid for that particular school. What's unfortunate is I had just signed a new lease literally down the street from my University, so I'm constantly reminded of the school now. I got into another school where I can finish up a double major online, but there's a part of my mind that just sort of hits me out of nowhere almost daily now about how I drank myself away from a nice school that I moved my entire life into a new city for, and even though I am still going to get a degree, I feel just constantly so depressed that I am still stuck in this lease and here. I got a decent new job, and I am trying to focus on getting my rental history &amp; job reference history up in a decent shape, and I'm not drinking as much, and I'm trying to make the most of this city. I don't think I am looking for any sort of advice really, maybe just someone else's thoughts on what I have been going through and to talk about it. I'm great at listening to, if anyone wants someone else to just listen.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Here are a few things about me:\n\n* I have a big passion for video games (and for a brief time I worked in the games industry) and I love board/tabletop games and card games as well!\n* I like watching anime and cartoons like Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Gravity Falls, Over the Garden Wall, etc.\n* I like cooking but don't cook very often. Some of my favorite things to make/eat include Asian cuisine and breakfast foods.\n* I listen to all kinds of music except not much country unfortunately. Chances are I have a few songs in my library that you listen to!\n* I play guitar on/off and have been thinking about getting a bass recently. Also learning to play the ukulele is high up on my bucket list.\n* I love travelling even though I don't take as many trips anymore. My next destination is hopefully Japan and maybe somewhere in Europe some day.\n* I've recently been getting into podcasts and have a bystander's interest in improv and poetry!\n* I enjoy making puns, being a bit of a goof, and making people laugh.\n* I appreciate dad jokes, puns, wit, and sarcasm as well!\n* I don't drink, smoke, swear (not sure why), but have no issue with other people that do (I actually like being around people that are comfortable enough to swear around me haha).\n\nI've recently come to love the term \"wholesome\" and think that it describes me pretty well. You don't have to be 100% wholesome but I'm hoping that deep down you're kind! I don't care about the mistakes you've made or the things about your personality that might draw other people away or if you have a criminal past, or heck even if we don't share similar interests. Do you respect the elderly? Do you have a soft spot for pets? Do you hold doors open for people so long that you start to feel awkward/get embarrassed? Do you have a very niche interest that you're passionate about? Those are the kinds of things I'd love to learn about you!\n\nAlso just to be 100% transparent, I'm kind of going through a lot of stress right now. I've been seeing a therapist recently and am just starting to realize how deep of a hole I've dug by isolating myself from other people and playing hard-to-contact by not being on social media. It's especially hard now that I'm done with college and and fairly shy/timid so it's difficult to meet new people with similar interests (which is probably the case for a lot of us here). But anyways, that's a big reason for my motivation to reach out here, since I'm sure there's a lot of awesome people out there. I'm not going to throw-up my distress and life story on you in the 2nd message, but I just want to start being upfront about things like that moving forward!\n\nAs indicated in the title, I'd love if you were nearby so that we may be able to meet and hang-out if we get to know each other, but I'd be more than happy to connect with anyone around the world! (Also pssst especially for you distant peeps: feel free to hit me up if you feel like playing anything cause I feel like I'm myself the most when I'm playing games :D) Anyways, thanks for the consideration and don't hesitate to send me a message!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I'm just looking for someone to talk to sometimes so that I don't feel so alone in the world.\n\nI've got some trust issues when it comes to people due to some seriously bad experiences over the last few years. Nothing too crazy, just means I might not open up right away. I'm hesitant to try to find a friend this way, as every \"friend\" I've met online has sort of abandoned me, but I don't really know what else to do.\n\nA little about me: first and foremost I am a hardcore geek. I love Harry Potter (I can literally hear a quote and tell you who said it and when in the book and movie), and have recently gotten into Star Wars. I'm also a super big Doctor Who fan.\n\nI don't watch much TV, but when I do it's usually some kind of crime show (Law &amp; Order: SVU, Criminal Minds, and such). Also, Brooklyn 99 &amp; Big Bang Theory. Or I'll watch some super old school show (Facts of Life, Saved by the Bell, Roseanne, etc.).\n\nI'm into old school rock n roll. Journey, Queen, The Police - stuff like that. I love Bubblegum hits (Leslie Gore, the Crystals, Bill Haley &amp; the Rockets) &amp; Motown (Supremes, Chubby Checker). I listen to some modern music, but it's usually oldies or country (again, the older country, not the modern pop country).\n\nLastly, my favorite thing in the world to do is Reading. Always Fiction of some kind. My favorite series are Harry Potter (shocker, right?), Percy Jackson (fun fact: I'm obsessed with Greek &amp; Roman Mythology), and the Chaos Walking. Otherwise, I'm usually reading a murder mystery thriller. \n\nSorry this is such a long post, but if you made it this far, you obviously like what you read and should PM me RIGHT NOW.

{"post_id": "bybrqq", "created_utc": 1560023154, "title": "Friendship in crisis", "author": "Bouncer4Life", "self_text": "Hello everyone! This is my new post here. I landed on this subreddit after searching for a right place to ask this question. So here's my question.\n\nThe background\n**************\n\nI'm a guy and I have a female friend. We've been friends since we passed out of school. (We were just acquaintances during the entire school life. Never met each other face-to-face. Started texting each other after we finished school).\n\n\nBoth of us did our undergraduate studies from different colleges. Her's being a 3 year UG course and mine being a 4 year one, both colleges being in a different state than where our school was. During the 2nd  year, we both met each other along with another friend from school.\n\nAfter that meeting, we became close and she started texting me about how she's getting bullied in her college.  (All this texting is on WhatsApp by the way). I used to lift up her mood and cherr her up. This ended in us becoming besties according to her. For me she's a close friend. Same thing, but worded differently. We also started to call each other once or twice in a month or so.\n\nNow after her UG course, she joined for a 2 year PG course at the same college, while I was doing my final year of UG course. She told me the 1st PG year is very hectic and she got less time to text than her UG days. I understood her situation and was okay with how she texted me less frequently.\n\nThe problem\n***********\n\nTwo months ago, her 1st year PG exams were about to start. As usual, she was texting me back once every 2-3 days.  But after one fine day, she never replied. I understood she is very busy and her academic life should be given the highest priority instead of wasting time on social media. I thought it would be fine if she could text back after all her exams were over, even if it takes a month.\n\nBut after a week of not replying, she started posting motivational quotes for her statuses. The first time I was okay with it. She's cheering herself up. No worries.\n\nBut the following month, she used to put up these motivational quotes as statuses every second day. Multiple at a time. Slowly I started to get pissed off. Finally, it became everyday. Now I lost it.\n\nShe has time to post multiple statuses everyday, but not time to text me that she's busy, lets talk later. I texted her after all this time again, sarcastically asking if she lost her phone or something. That session ended with her saying \"I thought we could talk after the exams. Thanks for understanding.\" and me ending it in a furious state of mind as \"Dont bother doing that\" ( The \"Don't bother texting me back after the exams\" kinda).\n\nNothing after that. A month later, brings us to the last week. She texted me a week ago, as if nothing had transpired. \"Hey. What's up? Im fine, at home. What about you?\". I took a day's time to reply to it in a monotonic way and didn't bother to continue the chat. Again a day later she initiates by saying hello. I ask her what's she doing nowadays. She says nothing, asks the same, I say nothing. Four days later bring us to me typing out this huge-ass essay.\n\n*************\n\n- Who's in the wrong?\n\n- Does she owe me an apology\n\nor\n\nShould I have been a better friend by understanding her lack of time to talk with me for two months?\n\n- In either case, how should I play this out? I find her to be a close friend. Don't want to fuck up this relationship.\n\nAny advices?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I've known this person online (long distance friendship) for about two years and helped him through some really hard stuff. He now sees me like family. Last year I ended our friendship for about 6 months because I thought I didn't want to be friends anymore for numerous reasons. Flash forward to the end of December in 2018, I rekindle our friendship because I felt a lot of guilt and I missed hanging out and playing video games with him. I feel like I can't end the friendship again because that would be a definite dick move and I don't want to hurt him because he is afraid of people leaving him. Here are the reasons I'm not sure if I want to remain friends.\n\n\\- He makes racist jokes sometimes which I normally don't mind to much if they're pretty innocent, but he started saying the N word and I really hate when he says it but I don't know how to tell him not to keep saying it. I also don't want to make him feel like I'm trying to change him so that's also why I haven't said anything.\n\n\\- I feel like I can't really connect with him, all we ever do is joke around really. I want to talk about deeper things sometimes but whenever I try to start a conversation it just goes back to goofing off.\n\n\\- The jokes are kinda repetitive. I don't feel excited about hanging out that much because I feel like there's a script we follow every time we hang out, and we can't move past it.\n\n\\- He recently said he is going on vacation for 2 weeks and can't talk for the entire time... I felt kind of relieved???\n\n\\- I don't completely feel like myself around him...\n\n\\- He alllwaayyyysss flakes right before we're supposed to hang out.

I\u2019m on mobile, so I apologize for the formatting. \nI\u2019ve been lurking for a little while, but so far I\u2019ve been pretty shy about posting. \nI\u2019ve been feeling pretty lonely lately and I feel like it\u2019s time to put myself out there a little more. Years back, when my internet obsession first started, I remember making an account on Meebo (if anyone remembers that) and I still talk to a couple of friends I made through there. I\u2019m hoping to find some people to keep in touch with in roughly the same manner. Although these aren\u2019t chat rooms, from what I\u2019ve seen, these threads are such a great way to reach out and meet new and like minded people. \nI live a pretty quiet life, alone with my two dogs. It\u2019s nice, but fairly isolating and lately it feels like the few hobbies I have haven\u2019t been keeping me stimulated enough to really enjoy them. I\u2019m going through a rough patch in life and just trying to keep my sights on the path ahead. \nI enjoy drawing, writing (especially developing stories and characters with friends), and cooking/baking among other things. I\u2019m open to trying new things and I\u2019ve even started getting into photography. Sometimes an ideal night off is a night spent watching some Netflix with the dogs after making dinner and chatting with friends about storylines. \nLately, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s difficult to find a place I fit in. I\u2019ve been dealing with finding my identity and coming into my own as someone who is Bisexual, but uncertain about my identity. \nI have a very close friend whom I care about deeply, but she\u2019s got some different priorities, so I don\u2019t hear from her too often. It\u2019s unfortunate, but we\u2019ve all got lives and I\u2019m certainly not her only friend. Unfortunately, although I have other friends, sometimes it seems like she really is my only one. Sometimes that happens! This is part of why I\u2019d like to expand my horizons alongside the simple desire to meet new people and share the stories that make us all special and unique individuals. \n\nThis seems to have gotten long, so I\u2019ll end it here. My name\u2019s April. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. :)\n\nJust a quick note to add - age and gender identity don\u2019t matter to me, but I feel it would be more appropriate to speak to people around my age, 18 and up preferably.

I no longer felt ''welcome'' or ''wanted'' by him, which caused me to distance myself too.\n\nLast week, I texted one of my once good friend about how I felt about my internal situation. We've known each other since being in the chess club together. In the text, I explained that I felt distant and I didn't know if I should've been part of the friend group anymore. Take note I left a disclaimer saying that I didn't want the message to jeopardize our friendship and how I didn't mean any harm. I only wanted to find clarity and a trustworthy opinion on the matter. He read it, but never bothered to respond, and I left it at that.\n\nI found out a couple days later that he actually blocked me on major social media websites we used a lot. At first I thought that it was a glitch, but later confirmed to be true. It really hurt finding out because this friend was really dear to my heart, and never once did a thought cross my head that he would ever respond like this. I felt horribly surprised, dejected, melancholy, and guilty over possibly ruining a once good friendship of over 5 years because of a stupid text. Up to this day, I still don't understand as to why he blocked me, and it continues to leave a bad feeling in my stomach every-time I think of it.\n\nI went back on social media yesterday in an attempt to ignore what happened and leave the past in the past. Instead, I left in a worse state than when I entered. He decided to make a post I could see. It included a collage of all his friends with a plethora of photos. Yet not in a single photo was I included, not in the many collages he created.\n\nThe decreasing pit of abandonment and dejection was immediately torn open when I viewed it. In a few days, I officially destroyed a friendship I really cherished. Now, that once good friend considers me only as a stranger, perhaps a menace to himself. It's a terrible feeling, really. One that I can agree any person would dread.\n\nAs of now, I no longer have anymore friends since I lost every single one. The future already is looking dreadful from a far glance, a vista I would rather not see.\n\nI don't know what to do at the moment,and I'm afraid that he will ignore anything I say to him. Obviously, he seems to not like me anymore, and the ''friend group'' has already stopped contacting me.\n\nAny advice would be nice, and hopefully there is a good solution to this ''dilemma''. Thank you in advance to any of the Redditors out there who took their time to read this, I appreciate it.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Her mother and  I worked together at a restaurant.  One day her daughter called and asked her mom what I was doing that night. I wasn't doing anything just working until 9:30pm that night.  Asked her mom if I wanted to hang out after work.  My friend just handed me the phone and walked out annoyed.  I told the girl (whom I did not know). I couldn't go oft that night it's late and my parents would never allow it.  At the time I was 19 years old, but my parents were super strict.\n (They're from the old country, that's how \"girls\" are raised. That's a story for another time.)\nEventually on one of my days off, I did hang out with this girl. I'll call her Dragon Breath, because yeah it fits, really. \n(Just to be clear we are both straight)\nWe were at the local mall there was a shop where they made shirts with spun paint.  They would write or draw what ever you wanted then spin it. The paint would spin outward, in al the bright colors you chose.  Dragon Breath really wanted one. She asked me to lend her money. She had to save her money for her orthodontist appointment. I reluctantly agreed.  I got one for myself.  We began to hang out a lot after that. I didn't have any friends, but one. She moved a few hours away with some friends of a friend.  I seemed to notice a pattern everytime we would hang out she had no money. The girl had a job same as me. \nOne day she invited me to come over. It was night.  When I got there everything was cool.  Enters her father he states.\n\nEntitled dad\nMy car is broken out front.  \n\nMe\nSorry to hear that.  Bummer.\n\nED\nMy wife (EM) went to visit her family back in Hawaii. \n\nMe\nThat's sounds like fun. I'm sure she's happy to see her family. I would be. My family is very close. I would totally miss my mum and da. \n\nED\nWell can I barrow your car or not. I gotta  go  get her. She's your friend don't you want her to be safe.\n\nME\nWell it's not my car.  I drive my da's car. If it breaks down he can't get to work.  Which airport?\n\nED\nThe one on the other side of the river. \n\nAt this point I'm feeling really pressured.  I was taught to respect my elders.  But I wanted to respect my da's car too.  Dragon Breath wasn't helping me out. \n\nME\nOk but I have to come with you.  There and straight back. \n\nHe agreed. I had a knot in my stomach.  Nervous the whole time.  Unfortunately for me.  I was a teenager newly licensed, lived in a very small town.  I had absolutely no big city driving experience.  So he drove the way there. When we arrived EM was waiting.  In she went and back across the bridge we went. Stopping for dinner at Denny's first.  I was so relieved when they didn't make me pay the bill. This was the one and only time I was treated by them. \nOnce we got back to their home I just dropped them off and gassed up my da's car. I always returned it with a full tank.  Looking back on it that was deffinately a setup. \n\nThere was this time.  It took many times of her b.s. for me to finally have enough of her broke ass mind you. Anyway we were at the mall browsing in a small shop. She picked out an item she liked and wanted to purchase.

She was never there for me when I went through it, but I worry she\u2019s having as much of a bad experience with him as I had. She chose to keep me out of it, but I just really bloody miss her despite her shitty behaviour. \n\n\n\nSo, a bit of background information. My best friend moved in with me in my home town at a time she didn\u2019t have anywhere else she wanted to be. It felt like one of the times we\u2019d been the closest and had the strongest friendship. And I was so happy to have her around. We joined a community based group that meant getting involved and meeting people, and I ended up dating a guy that we met together at this thing. He was honestly the most abusive relationship I\u2019d ever been in.\n\nDuring the relationship he was over the top worrying I\u2019d cheat, and part of his mind games was in isolating me from any one and everyone because in his eyes, everyone was a threat. And so I had little choice at the time and became quite distanced from my friend, as he Continually guilt tripped me over having a good friendship with her, I was always happy around her, we had a great time laughing and singing along to music and dancing just making a cup of tea and he was jealous of that, and thought it could turn into more. I guess he also felt threatened if I\u2019d tell anyone about all the things going on and be told to leave him, and he made sure I was Completely alone and felt like I couldn\u2019t be having conversations with anyone about him and what was going on. \n\nHe was good friends with her too the entire time, and it was always okay when he had times out with friends, but not me. \nI went through So much heartache completely alone because of this. He was a compulsive liar, emotionally manipulative/abusive, sexually abusive/manipulative and even continually raped me. When I confronted him about that and how it really hurt that he never respected my right to say \u201cno\u201d, No Matter my reasons, how sternly or repeatedly I said it, just do it anyway,, he would turn it on me and make me feel like the bad guy for upsetting him, only then making me too scared to say no in the future, which meant it never stopped, it just stoped being actual rape by definition that he could be held responsible for. \n\nOne tactic I saw right through was his manipulative talk of children, he wanted a kid so bad and I wasn\u2019t in the place for it, he was living with his him mum with constant employment changes and the longer I was with him the sicker I was getting (not realising it was the toxicity and stress I guess), had to quit my job and spent a lot of time in his bed sick. \nHe knew it would be irresponsible and that I didn\u2019t want kids maybe ever. But he\u2019d always come home delightedly telling me about an encounter he had with children that day or a conversation he had with a coworker about their kids and about how he Really Wants them. \nIt was just in his tone I could see through this one. Now, I can\u2019t be sure it was one of the times he raped me, however I have a feeling it was and that it was deliberate, he got me pregnant. Many times I said no because we didn\u2019t have protection at the time, and one of those times I really don\u2019t think he Tried to pull out. \nAnyways,  it Really threw my illness into overdrive and I became very unwell, I aborted early because I Knew it wouldn\u2019t be fair on the kid or me , and that seemed to be the beginning of his decline, where he seemed to fear losing his control over me more and more with every day, he seemed more unhappy with me and like it wasn\u2019t going to work in his favour anymore. \n\nEventually my friend moved out to a different state, and during that time, my boyfriend and broke up, though I\u2019m ashamed to say it wasn\u2019t my coming to my senses and leaving him. \nAt the time of the breakup, my friend had come up to visit again and was prioritising her friendship with my ex, she wasn\u2019t there for me at all while I was going through that, and left me crying alone while she was hanging out with him. \nEventually she admitted that she would be moving back to town and sharing a house with him and another friend. I was both devastated and happy, as I wanted her around but felt a pang of betrayal at how much she stayed friends with him. She didn\u2019t know All the details at the time about the abusive ways, but even so I know she saw me become a shell a of myself during it and that if it were the other way around, he\u2019d be dead to me and I\u2019d have been there for her.  \n\nHe got a new girlfriend at some point and she was doing her own thing, and needless to say, her living in town again still meant I hardly saw her, and whenever we did it felt different, she was living a completely new life and I was watching her become something new that didn\u2019t involve me in any way, having new friendships and relationships with coworkers all of whom I didn\u2019t know or never met, and she didn\u2019t make a lot of effort to bring me into it meeting them or inviting me out with them etc. That was fine and I understood, but I just started really missing her. \n\nOne of the times that we hung out for while, she mentioned she was thinking of moving out as he\u2019s a terrible roommate, and I decided to tell her the entire truth, I disclosed Every Detail about how he treated me, so help her understand why I still wasn\u2019t comfortable visiting if he was home, and she seemed sad for me, but then never moved out and continued valuing her friendship with him over me?\n\nAt one point we attended a party and I disclosed to her the following day that I was really upset we weren\u2019t spending time together anymore, that we should commit to a regular brunch or something because I hate never seeing her and having such a nice night made me feel a post-weekend depression when the fun is over but it was stronger because it\u2019s not just until next weekend. She agreed but she was still showing signs of having moved on from me in so many ways, she was having a blast with a guy from the party come up for the weekend, they dated for like a night or so only for me to hear that on my ex\u2019s birthday, she had slept with him, thus cheating on my ex\u2019s new girlfriend and quite possibly her cheating on the boy from the party. \n\nI ended up talking to the girl that my ex had cheated on, and later I found out he\u2019d been Exactly the same to her as he\u2019d been to me, Almost to the letter. \n \n\nAnyway, here\u2019s where it all comes to a head. \nI went over to my friends house to catch up with her and looking for some insight as I\u2019d heard it from the outside that her and my ex were together now and I wanted to hear it from her. She told me, and I said that I wasn\u2019t upset they were together dating now, I said I wasn\u2019t going to warn her off him again as I\u2019d done when I told her my whole story with him ages ago, that if she needs to go down this path for herself that\u2019s okay, but that I\u2019d actually be there for her on the otherside if it all goes to shit unlike her for me before. Just don\u2019t expect me to be hanging out at the same time that he\u2019s around because I\u2019m still very uncomfortable to be around him.\nI reinstated that I wasn\u2019t upset they were together, but that I was upset that she didn\u2019t care about me at all when I was going through such a hard time, that it hurt she wasn\u2019t being a good friend to me when I needed her before. She did try to defend, \u201cit\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t Care....\u201d \n\u201cwell, what is it then?\u201d\nand a good minute of silence, umming and ahhing, I said that answers the question then, and I left crying. \n\nI cried for her a lot, I just lost my best friend even though I\u2019d already sort of lost her a year prior, it hurt and I mourn for what it was before the guy ever came along. Because while he\u2019s not manipulating me anymore, he sure has her tied around his finger. And while one of us is under the spell, everything is shit. And I\u2019m worried, I haven\u2019t heard anything from the birds in so long since hearing she and him are moved back in with his mother,  and I can picture her depressed in his bed never leaving the house becoming a shell of herself. \n\nBut the second I walked out of her house that day, she blocked me on Facebook and and had our third musketeer who was over seas at the time block me as well, who wasn\u2019t a part of any of it. It\u2019s now a significant time passed, third friend is back from over seas now and at one point she unlocked me and apologised for getting hyped up on the bandwagon, Claiming that friend said had Only said I \u201cwasn\u2019t supportive of the relationship\u201d. But anyway, I haven\u2019t seen third friend yet and she\u2019s not making much effort with me and obviously is with others. My friend also unblocked (but not re-added obviously) me a while ago and so now all I\u2019m seeing are them tagging each other in stuff and it hurts because I want them both back, everything back to normal. \nI feel stupid for wanting it back because it was already lost, I don\u2019t want it back to just before it blew up because the direction we were headed was bad news anyway, for so long I was only ever called upon by either of them when they needed something, often assuming without even asking that I\u2019d do whatever it was they wanted, only occasionally see them and for something of their benefit, but I do miss when everything was good. \n\nWe\u2019ve come back from Bigger shit but I\u2019m really worried on this one that we won\u2019t, not unless she has as bad an experience with him that she comes out of and becomes clearer on the longer the manipulation wears off and then realises everything, but I don\u2019t wish that on her, I Hope she has a better time and that by now he\u2019s learned a lesson or two, but I can\u2019t drive anywhere in town without an image popping into my head of her crying walking somewhere and picking her up and getting her back, and then after hearing what she has to say, maybe going and kicking my ex in the balls.\n But it doesn\u2019t seem likely right now that I\u2019ll ever get her back. I\u2019m so alone, I was hoping third friend coming back would mean I could tell her I miss the way things used to be and they\u2019d talk about me after and come to a conclusion to make up with me or some shit. But I get the feeling the only things they\u2019ve said about me so far is furthering that I\u2019m Out. I don\u2019t know what to do, I tried moving on for the longest time I stopped letting myself worry or hope for a future where we\u2019re friends again and like I don\u2019t care she made her decision to go this path without me so let it go, but for the last month or so I can\u2019t stop missing her. I don\u2019t even care how shit of a friend she\u2019s been and that just annoys me.\n\nIf anyone has some advice or has gone through similar, I\u2019d love to hear, or even just some sense reassured to me it let it go unless it comes back to me or some poetic shit.

Don't worry about those I'm already talking with I will still talk with you. Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nI just recently graduated from college with a degree in film. I suffer from both anxiety and depression. It effects me a lot on day to day basis mostly depression. Some days I'm fine Some I'm not. So if I complain about being depressed please understand I can't control it and at least be sympathetic towards it.\n\nI'm also somewhere on the spectrum. Its not as severe as other people probably, like you wouldn't think It because I'm on the high functioning side of the spectrum. However my social skills are really bad which makes it difficult to make friends in real life. \n\nI'm a very shy, lonely and boring person. I have a hard time making conversation so I might be boring to talk to. I will try my best. I don't have much in life as I'm searching for work at the moment. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Game of Thrones, The Handmaid's Tale, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03. If you going to message me I recommend you being around my age at least 18-26. Nobody younger or older to chat with cause I feel it would be awkward lol. I can make some exceptions. \n\nImportant, don't bother sending me a message if your just going to ghost. It really hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Also I  don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again. It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have a Kik, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now.

Me being a girl and not knowing if I wanted to turn that way in my sexuality decided that maybe we could try it. I had been feeling Bi-curious and I did actually like her. So we became really close friends and didn't actually end up dating but me and her were practically inseparable. At school we were the two girls you always saw together. We did everything together. She was into the guy and I was totally supportive of her and for a few months they were talking and it seemed to be going well but then it ended between them. Later on a few months later me and him started talking. Of course I asked if she was ok with it and she said that it was fine and she claimed that she new I liked him so she decided to \"let me have him\" So me and him talked for awhile and we got into an argument and were not talking for a couple of days. I find out that she and him had started talking while me and him were talking and I wasn't upset that they were talking I was upset that she didn't tell me about it. I mean we were best friends and we told each other everything and it upset me that she didn't tell me. This all happened at the beginning of the next school year and that's when her sisters decided to come to the same school. All of a sudden I felt like I was being replaced she stopped hanging out with me as much she would ditch me at school and just leave me hanging for someone else and I was getting really upset. At first I just let her walk all over me because I didn't want her to get mad. But when I finally started speaking up for myself she absolutely hated it. She was becoming mean and she only thought of herself. If I liked a guy and was talking to him, she liked him and was talking to him to. Every. Single. Time. Before all of this we did end up dating but we were keeping it a secret because we were scared we would be made fun of. So the only time we would show affection was on weekends and sometimes not even then. I became really upset because it seemed like she didn't actually like me. We were on and off so many times. The last time we dated it ruined or friendship completely. She kept saying she wished I liked her as much as I would another guy and I kept telling her that I did. But it became such a problem that I did start to care about him more. I tried telling her that we needed to break up and just be friends but she wouldn't accept it. That morning I walked up and said hi to her she said hi back in a snobby way and didn't even look at me while saying it. I looked at her and said \"you know what I'm done\" And walked away. I broke up with her over message afterwards and she replied with \"fine I was going to break up with you anyway\" When I had just tried breaking up the day before and she refused. She posted on Snapchat something about how fake people needed to get out of her life and so I said fine I'm out. She was like ok byeeee. Then a couple days later she got the notion that I was saying bad things behind he back so she posted a whole bunch of things about me. About nudes I had sent two years ago and how I took some pictures of myself in booty shorts and sent them to people (I had only sent them to her and my other lady friend) and that I forced a guy to stick his fingers in me on a school bus (it was consensual on both ends not forced) it was also the same guy we had a fight over the last year. I told some of my family about all of this and they said she was jealous that I wanted someone else more than I wanted her. But the way she treated me was terrible. She made me feel so worthless that I self harmed and even thought of suicide because I thought I wouldn't be able to stand it if she wasn't my friend. I finally left and it was a really big struggle for me. But sometimes when I see her I want to strangle her and watch the light drain from her eyes but other times I miss her like hell and I do not want to miss her after everything she did to me. I did do stuff but nothing like what she did to me. Please help!!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Thank you!* :) \n\n\nFinally finished my 40-hour security course last weekend, so pretty thrilled to actually start working soon!\n\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info (AKA full autobiography) about me:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate. In the process of joining CAF\u2019s reserves as, planning on Military Police role. \n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned careers, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics. At least, in regards to most topics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, although it had not surfaced for quite a while now; enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n- Chronically single, not that it is pertinent (After all, this is not r/r4r, ~~unless it is~~ - but *no* - I do not want your wiener and / or boob pictures, unless it is a wiener dog or you've a pair cuter than [these ones](https://galapagosconservation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Wildlife-BFB_1000x600.jpg)).\n\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am rather stigmatized against the latter by some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not, in fact, a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandise and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed.\nDespite that, I am in favour of marijuana's legalization so who knows \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Automata, WoW, Bioshock series, Prey, Metal Gear Solid, the &gt;Observer_, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. \nHonestly, for whatever reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nRight now I am playing Dwarf Fortress.. and thus far, is is going more or less OK. We got attacked by a wererat, and it ended.. not too well. Both of my best Macedwarves were brutally killed, plus a really good Ranger. In addition, two more of my warriors were bitten - and are now afflicted with the dreadful curse. \nI am in the process of isolating them from the rest of my fortress, with remotely controlled lever to release them in a suicide charge when an enemy tries to besiege us. \n\nIn addition, our Legendary Weaponsmith was Posessed, which led to him creating a mighty artefact - a steel shortsword that he called \"Duskbathed\". It is currently wielded by our militia commander.. May it bring her glory! \n\n\n\n(Ahem, tangents. I love talking about my games, as you can see!)\n\n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favourite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \nAlso just re-started Futurama after finishing season 7. Woo.\n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favourite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loathe cheap jumpscares they are so enamoured with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n\n- My sense of humour is possibly the worst, and I take pride in having offensive memes for every occasion ready. Needless to say, I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile stuff. \n\n- My main hobby right now is Airsoft. I spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together since I ordered most of my gear from companies in Russia, not wanting to settle for cheaper substitutes. At least the quality is as good as it gets!  \nThe centrepiece of my collection is my plate carrier which came with full kevlar inserts and is of the model that is only issued to specific units of Russia's FSB. \nPew pew pictures are available on request!\n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I suck at categorizing music that I like, and listen to most genres, so it is simpler to say what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord).\nSeriously though, I am big on modern and older metal, rock, punk, indie-esque stuff, EDM and so on. \n\n I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n\nSome of my favourite bands are Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Muse, Green Day, Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, NIN and many, many more - if it is not obvious by this point, I am so edgy that I (used to) cut myself :D\n\n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%, due to a certain affinity for slithering neck-ties and positive human qualities like ambition, narcissism and general douchebaggery. But hey, at least I am honest (?) :D \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. Stuf like lack o punctuatuion impropar gramar to short n generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit. \n\nAgain, rephrasing the last part for dozens of people who simply don't get it: *you now know a certain amount about myself. After reading your message, I should be able to know a certain amount about you - not asking for something as in depth as here, but the \"Hello my name is X I am from Y and I like Z\" is not good enough.*\n\nAlso, here are some pictures of [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0), because why not? \n\n *Please, PMs only*! I loath Reddit Chat UI. I would prefer to talk here for the first while as compared to going over to certain apps whose names trigger bots..\nThe odds are, if you ignore this, I will either not see your Chat or don\u2019t reply on principle :3 \n... If you did not understand it, I am on the picky side.\n\nFeel free to hit me with your favourite ice breaker / shower question!

Q has been my friend for about 7\\~ years, I would consider her a close friend. Things have been a bit rocky between us, though.\n\nPast year or so, we've been kind of developing into our own adult lives. She always, always seems to have something big going on, and lately, whenever I do see her, she's constantly talking about herself and her own problems with no regard for me. If I bring up something of mine, she writes me off with something like \"could be worse\" or \"but my problems are x\" and so on. I've just been limiting my time with her (which is easy, we're both busy, her moreso than I) despite really wanting to hang around with her and have a friend to talk to.\n\nNow, my S/O, I'll call him N. He's known Q just a tad bit longer than I have, but not by much, and Q ended up introducing me to N.\n\nN works around the area where Q lives/works, so they see each other often, and talk a bit more these days than Q and I do. They often head out into town, sometimes when I'm unable to considering I live on the opposite end of town and the bus schedule tends to suck. I wish I could join more often, but overall, I don't really care. They face a lot of the same issues in life and I'm glad they can get some alone time together.\n\nSo keeping that in mind, about a week or so ago, I asked Q out for lunch since it had been quite some time where we sat down and it was just us. She told me that she would let me know when she's free. Okay! Great! I'll wait for you. Conversation over. I let N know that this is the only conversation I've had with her recently, and he tells me to try harder and set a solid date (Which I'm not sure how to do given she won't tell me when she's not working.)\n\nThis past week, Q and N got together after work, and talked about things that they kind of needed to talk about. I'm thinking that I possibly must have come up in conversation, because Q posted some stuff on facebook like \"If you have a problem with me, talk to me. If you want to hangout with me, talk to me.\" etc. \n\nI suppose I'm just sitting here thinking \"...Okay? I have asked you to hang out? I have tried to talk to you?\" \n\nI'll admit, the main reason why I want to sit down with her, 1-on-1, at somewhere that's not a bar, is to talk about her recent behaviour, and how she's just been disregarding me. I realize she has a lot on her plate, but damn, so do I. She's not the only one living life here.\n\nAm I wrong to think that she should be contacting me if she wants to meet up? I've tried, many times, and it just gets tiring. I feel like I am driving down a one way street and there just seems to be little to no communication skills with her. I try to keep it open but I'm really tired of trying to be the \"good friend\" and keep trying to arrange something, only to either just talk about her or get told \"I'll let you know\" and never hear from her. Am I a bad friend for just wanting to distance myself? I feel like I'm being a bad friend, but at the same time I no longer have energy for this sort of thing. Advice would be very much appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Long term friend doesn't seem to want to communicate, and when we get together, 99% of things conversational wise are about her. Tried to set up a get together with her, but she won't tell me when she's free, and then turns around and posts on FB \"If you want to hang out, tell me\" bs. Balls in her court, am I wrong?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

These two women that were involved in my life. And before that I was living with this narcissistic lady who was incredibly emotionally abusive and really tried to be my mother it was awful I hated her so much. But like ok the thing is is that I've been really quite antisocial most of my life. I have received two conflicting diagnostic impressions of schizoid and aspergers. Don't know which one more inclined to think I have aspergers but I have a very strong internal fantasy world that I hate when people disrupt it and I'll usually be lost in my own thoughts rather than really be present and communicative when I talk to others. I hate when people bring me hurtling back into reality. It is much too painful and that is what feels like what happened the past few months. But throughout my life I've been more used to going most days without uttering a single world, I have never had many friends, and have been quite distant from my family also they are like strangers to me and there's so much about me that they have no idea about. In my early twenties I had friends and went to parties and would do drugs and drink a lot but that was it and I hated those guys and stopped hanging out with them and everyone when I was 23 and spent the next four years isolated doing drugs and drinking. I got sober at 27, graduated college, moved back to the state I was born in and had been away from for 22 years, and tried to be more outgoing and sociable. A large reason why I've always kept to myself was because I was quite ugly and I'm embarrassed to admit this but I used to weigh 100 lbs more than I currently do and so I knew that no one wanted me around or to talk to me. So I came out here I lost the weight and for the first time in my life at 27 I am at a healthy weight and not only that people are even worried that I'm too thin which is weird to me now.\n\nBut yeah so that narcissistic lady would do things like tell me she would celebrate my birthday with me. But then she called on my birthday forgetting it and telling me she was going to out of town to party with friends. She was doing a lot of cocaine. But it's not like I was the one wanting to talk to her, not like I even mentioned my birthday to her or asked her to celebrate it with me or anything it's like she would always say she would do things with me so that she could in her eyes appear compassionate and giving and then she would always forget me. I honestly didn't want to spend a single minute with her but the fact that she would always forget me and leave me aside...\n\nAnd that's how I feel with the other two women I met and with everyone in general really. I feel passed over. Completely looked over. No one takes an interest in me and learning about me and who I am. I could be a really interesting person. No one knows. Because no one's bothered to find out. I have such a very strong vivid internal world and when the outside world doesn't recognize it as being as real it's like I feel a bit like a startled sleepwalker.\n\nAnd then so I relapsed because she was a miserable person to live with and was doing lsd and molly and mushrooms with her and began to hang out with all these kinds of people I didn't want to hang out with again like this one guy who tried to fight me at a party we went to and it's like I'm not scared of anyone in this small mountain town I've been shot at, had knives pulled on me, I mean hell one of my earliest memories was of a drive by shooting.\n\nBut yeah so I went to a crisis stabilization unit because I'm not a very pleasant drunk. There I might this lady who I will refer to as slightly less crazy lady. She told me that she and I were exactly the same we had similar kind of stories. In there she always insisted on talking to me. Same when we got out. She was a runway model at one point. She acted like such a horrible spoiled diva. She's actually in jail now for domestic violence. I felt bad for her at first because she said we were similar and also because she was telling me that her living situation was an absolute nightmare and she was making it out to be like she was going through such a tragedy and I would feel bad for her. Like she was saying she had to live with her ex because she has a felony because the police unjustly arrested her and beat her up since she was resisting being arrested. She claimed to have had such bad ptsd from that incident. And she was saying her ex was the only person she could live with who she knew in this state and she was saying he was really emotionally abusive. Turns out she was the one actually physically abusing him. I mean I feel like such an idiot but at least I eventually cut ties with her. Well the thing is is that it was good to have slightly less crazy lady around. Because while everything was happening with that narcissistic lady slightly less crazy lady was there and it was nice to have the validation like I'm not crazy because narcissistic lady was heavily heavily gaslighting me something I found out about at the crisis unit.\n\nWell so slightly less crazy lady and I had an argument and we stopped talking for a little bit. Then into my place now that there was a room available since narcissistic lady moved out - in moved crazy lady. A pure nightmare from the absolute depths of hell. I wrote about it here (https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/bwexuo/im_28_it_was_the_first_time_anyone_ever_told_me/).\n\nBasically a lady from a domestic violence shelter moved in, me and her kissed, she wanted at first to be friends with benefits, but then she said I love you, I didn't say it back, she got back with her ex that put her in that shelter, a lot of drama ensued and then I started hanging out with slightly less crazy lady again and then stopped talking with her again.\n\nI keep having intrusive thoughts. I keep replaying everything that's happened. All the drama. I can't stop thinking about it all. And so many things that have happened in the past. I can't really sleep well because a memory will appear and I'll be able to relive it very vividly like I said I have a very strong internal world so I'll get really caught up in everything and I won't be able to go to sleep. I have vertigo because of inner ear problems and it gets really bad especially these days and I haven't been eating much and I'm just so overwhelmed. Like just completely brought fully into reality and I can't escape it even in my own world I'm not able to escape reality anymore. In my own dream world it's been overrun by nightmares. I can't escape my own head now so it's like well where else can I go? I tried to go out again but it's like shit my social anxiety has come back I'm finding my confidence that I worked hard to build up has just completely crumbled and fallen apart. I just would like someone to talk to so I can distract myself from everything.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Well, a genuine and solid friendship would do (though I wouldn't be necessarily be against something more than that). Honesty, being (reasonably) open to each other about our feelings and thoughts, having (at least) some shared values, giving each other feedback and advice when necessary - I would love to experience these things once more (I've been fortunate enough to meet people like these, even here on Reddit). \n\n***\n\n##### A few facts about me\n\n- I'm a 23-year-old CS student, and I'm currently based in Italy (where I've also lived for most of my life). I do have an intention to move somewhere colder - Norway? Germany? Time will tell - but that will take me a few more years. \n\n- When I'm not successfully fighting procrastination, I prefer to spend most of time [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/steppenwolf_phaedrus), [listening to music](https://open.spotify.com/user/steppenwolf.phaedrus), [watching TV series and movies](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur60726342/watchlist) and YouTube commentaries. I do also enjoy play video games, but I've stayed away from pretty much everything that's both multiplayer and popular (though there might be some things we could play together)\n\n- I'm very introverted, but I'm fine with chatting on an (almost) daily basis with people I can get along well. Voice chats on the other hand are generally much trickier and way more exhausting, but we could have those too from time to time. \n\n- I have a taste for everything that's romantic, melancholic, strange, mysterious and/or uncanny, be it in music, literature, TV/movies or video games. I also appreciate dark and/or politically incorrect discussions and humor, and I'm hard to offend, won't have to censor yourself around me in any way.\n\n- I'm a cat person and I own one as well - a cat, not a person - and I'd be glad to share pics and the occasional ridiculous cat story with you.\n\n- I have a passion for languages and accents. I'm currently learning Russian, but I also plan to learn German, (possibly) Norwegian and maybe something else.  If you're a native speaker of the languages I mentioned - or you're learning them too, or you want help with Italian or English - and want to team up, that would be lovely!\n\n- I mainly use Discord, but I'd be willing to use Telegram or - if they're the only platforms we could use - VKontakte, Skype or Whatsapp.  Due to my schedule, I'd rather talk to people from time zones that aren't too far from CET/GMT+1, and I'll have to decline requests from anyone beyond EST (GMT-3) or GMT+3.\n\n***\n\nWell, I guess this will do for a start. If you feel like we could get along and become friends, feel free to drop a PM - not a Reddit chat message! I'd rather avoid that -  with some information about yourself and about what we have in common, and we'll move on from there. \n\nHope to hear from you soon!\n\nAlex", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

My inbox was filled with lots of amazing people, with some interesting stories and backgrounds, from all over the world with lots of thing in common with me. That filled my heart with joy in ways I can't describe with words. Seeing so many people interested in me, wanted to be my friend, taking their time to right long messages and describe themselves in creative, amazing ways, was amazing. It was a instant boost in my self esteem and I felt great for a while.\n\nBut I guess nothing changed? Before I had no one to talk to, now I have lots of people, and I still feel lonely in a way. Seeing so many people, so many replies, gave me social anxiety, I couldn't reply, it was too much for me to handle. I couldn't open my reddit for a few days and I felt like shit. At the same time, things in my work got out of control and now I'm working about 12 hours a day and get too mentally tired all the time to try talking to others, specially not in my mother tongue. My depression got worse, my dog is dying, and I'm losing control of everything. I thought to myself \"I asked for this, I should be happy! I should be able to do all this, you just need to take a time and talk to this people\" but I don't know why I couldn't. I'm sorry if you send me a message and I didn't reply. I started to reply some, explain my situation. Some understood, some just didn't, some took it personal and I felt like I was the worst person ever. I started therapy last friday and is something I'll be working on the future. My goal is to get over this social anxiety and be friends with all this amazing people that I found here. I'm trying my best. I guess my timing is just really bad, and this was the worst time ever to commit to friendships. This is not me and I can be so much better. I just need you all to be patience, please. \n\nI truly don't want to sound ungrateful, because I'm very much, and I thought a lot before posting this here. But maybe some people are feeling the same as I am and this could help them. I understand now that my loneliness is something my mind created, not necessarily the environment I'm into. **You can have lots of friends and talk to lot of people but feel lonely, in the same way that you can have no one to talk to and feel good and comfortable in your own way. Maybe you should feel better with yourself before trying to feel better with others.** If you feel the same, try some therapy, try asking for help. It's horrible to feel this way.\n\nI'm truly sorry.\n\nAs always, here's another drawing!

I\u2019m a 22M need advice on how to tell someone we should \u201cpart ways\u201d or for lack of better words not be friends anymore. \n\nHere\u2019s the deal. We met in college and became friends pretty quickly adjacent to other classmates as we all were the same major and shared every class together. We graduated from community college known each other for 2.5 to 3 years now and kept our relationship and continued to hang out such as going to the movies etc. \n\nHowever, over the last few months of being around her has not felt the same. I feel as if there is this energy/gut feeling when I\u2019m around her that I need to keep distance and I have not felt that way about other friends I chose to hang out with in a long time. For instance, last month went to the movies twice and I invited two other friends of mine and I began feeling those \u201cvibration/energy\u201d again from her but I brushed it off. That same day we went of going to the movies she said \u201cI look like one of those people that have a lot of money but don\u2019t show it.\u201d I felt taken a back but brushed it off again and continued causal conversation but the rest of the day did not feel right. I could not even enjoy the movie afterwards. It\u2019s difficult to explain in a way that I feel I need to be careful what I do or say and that she might suddenly become upset. Not out of rage per say but a subtle \u201creally, like come on\u201d kind of way. For example, afterwards we went shopping because she wanted to buy a sweater. After she buys it I found there was a similar looking sweater for a lower price and she says something like \u201cyou couldn\u2019t tell me earlier?\u201d But, it\u2019s the tone in the way things are said that throws me off or makes me wonder if I should continue being friends. Kind of like a hit or miss feeling. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a joke or not. Another example, I have a cat and she really wants a cat. As we are walking she asks me \u201care you the only one who has a cat or do they have one too?\u201d Then theirs always a nod without making eye contact with me. Similar to when I mention I want to save my coffee from DD later so I can have energy to work on my scholarship application, then asking \u201cwhat are you doing to have coffee at that time?\u201d I tell her I need to finish my scholarship essay then there\u2019s that nod without looking at me. She\u2019s done this nearly every time I mention I am doing an application for drama school or something similar. Now when I look back, she\u2019s done this kind of thing before for example, it was a topic of going to the gym and I tell her my brother brings me as a guest and she said something like, \u201cso that\u2019s how you get it\u201d. Or when I lent her my computer program membership and someone added in once, \u201ccharge such and such dollars (like $10 bucks a month) to lessen the cost overall but still share. But then says something like, \u201cbut your mom pays for it.\u201d\nAnd for the last few months when she\u2019d call me when she\u2019s out of work in the evening to tell me she\u2019s tired and an every so often \u201cyou don\u2019t understand\u201d. As a result of these bits of things/conversation, I feel as if there is this tension between us that I can\u2019t quite put my finger on it even though it might seem easy for me to call it jealousy or envious. Similar to when we were in a coffee shop and two of my other friends were there after the movie and I turn towards my other friend about something then turn towards her I can feel a sense of \u201csituational difference or awareness \u201d emanating when I turn towards her. I know I don\u2019t always have to work so I could focus on my studies but that aside It\u2019s the non verbal cues that make explaining this so difficult. I never really left her alone that day except when we used the rest room and and did quick shopping. Other than that I was always next to her and talking. Also, when we were walking and I asked her something similar to \u201chow are things going?\u201d Then saying \u201cwell you know issues with here and there\u201d (not literally but one sentence of her personal issues) I understand she\u2019s has her own issues in her life. But, it felt more like a draining day than one uplifting.\n\n\nI spoke with her over the phone about about two days or so after we hanged out and said that I was overthinking when I mentioned how she says things and the \u201cI look like I have a lot of money but don\u2019t show it\u201d and that she meant it as a compliment. This was after a week of not responding to her after the conversation. But when we spoke again on the phone she mentioned she asked her sibling about it then said \u201c I even asked so and so and I thought so that\u2019s how it is?\u201d (The one week \u201cghosting\u201d after I did not speak back to her) One week later again she texted back something like \u201cDid I lose my friendship with you and I just didn\u2019t get that\u201d , \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be my friend no more I\u2019ll accept that but it does hurt and I see you as one of my best friends.\u201d I responded that I\u2019ve been busy with school apps  and responds \u201coh okay that\u2019s fine I just wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d After that I responded a good luck with her class project and if I could call her the next day but I didn\u2019t. A week later she texts me that I am ghosting her. I felt I was at a point where I did not know what to do because my gut feeling is telling me it\u2019s best we part ways. And looking back, when ever she speaks of wanting to be known artist I feel that adds over to the tension or energy I feel around when I talk about pursuing my acting. I know this because when we spoke in person once on our way to the movies there\u2019s this blank face that I cant quite explain. She\u2019s a great girl and has a wit to her humor but it does not feel the same as when we were in classes and school together. We have similar interests but this has been overall making me wonder if we are really fit for a friendship in the long term. And I dislike having to look back at other things that make me wonder if this is a true friendship. But this energy/gut feeling thing is a strong signal I feel it\u2019s best to part ways. For my other friend who met her for the first time it seems somewhat confusing to let her go, but as an empath I am very aware of things. Not to sound all mystical or pretentious but I just feel this is the right choice unfortunately and I don\u2019t know how to say goodbye or parts ways. I don\u2019t want to be part of this ghosting epidemic as if it was done towards me which it has not, at least for those who I repeatedly spent time with. But I wouldn\u2019t want that feeling of not having an answer back so I need advice on how to say my goodbyes.\n\n- thanks sorry for long post.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Of that time, they've only had a week's worth of face to face time. She's planning on moving in August because she wants to get there before Brexit happens, but she doesn't seem to have any understanding of what Brexit will mean (i mean who does?) but hasn't been following the news about it and seems to think that the only issue she may be dealing with is how long her visa will last on her Polish passport. She was shocked when i suggested that there is a potential food shortage if they don't get a deal ASAP. \n\n  \nShe's planning on moving in with him, and is currently applying for jobs, but despite the fact that she graduated two years ago, has never in her life had any kind of job other than the occasional dog-walking. Because of this she isn't getting very far because she doesn't have references. What is more worrying to me is that she doesn't have any savings- he's paying for her ticket over there, and she balked at the idea that i suggested she get a job at a pub or a cafe if she doesn't get something in her field. I KNOW London is an expensive city to just exist in even if you don't have to pay rent, and i can see this quickly becoming a very grim situation for her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe also as you can probably guess, has a bit of a chequered history with mental health issues. When the last boyfriend she had broke up with her she was pretty severely depressed, she dropped out of uni for a bit, and it honestly took most of  two years before she was kind of getting back to being a relatively normal functioning human again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: my friend is moving to the otherside of the world to be with a man she's known for four and a half months, and she has no savings to speak of and no back up plan. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone been through something similar?

A More Detailed Post!", "author": "rottenteeths", "self_text": "I posted one of these last week, but thought I'd remake it and do more detail into it, since my original was like.. vague.\n\nI'm Rue! I'm 23, I'm Nonbinary, so I really go by like. Male or Female identities, though I just mainly call myself a Transguy since I feel more masculine. (I will happily answer questions about this!) I'm in the Southern US, but I originally moved from Texas where I grew up in 2017. I'm a stay at home worker, doing digital art, and crafts (Though I main job at the moment is caring for my pets, and the one who keeps the house clean, and proper.)\n\nI'm looking for people I can just chat to on Discord, or Twitter, or here or where ever!\n\n**Hobbies:**\n\nMy hobbies are more on the artistic side as a whole- I produce digital art, I like to sew, do animations and videos, etc etc. If it's something I can do with my hands, I wanna do it! I really want to sell at Conventions, and produce cosplays, and later form my own Etsy. \n\nI love animals, I have over 30! 2 Dogs, 5 Cats, 7 Leopard Geckos, 5 Snakes, a Parrot, A tegu, Bearded Dragon, Crested Gecko, Frogs, Tarantulas etc etc! I've owned almost one of every species so far, even horses in the past, so I like to do a lot I can. Most of my animals are rescues, though there are a few I have bought as my own pets here and there.\n\nI really love plant keeping, too, and interior design. I collect a lot of things too, from Taxidermy items (rabbit pelts, bones, claws, teeth of animals that have naturally passed on, cruelty free interest here!), Crystals and Gems, Candles, Pop Funkos, EOS Lip Balms, Rilakkuma Dolls, name brand clothes, enamel pins, and cutesy stuff! I've been teased a lot for having cute Hello Kitty, Pom Pom Purrin and Rilakkuma right next to all of my dead butterflies, animal bones, and game horror concept art books (Silent Hill Hell Yeah)\n\n**Books &amp; Games**:\n\nBooks I tend to read a lot of like.. Young Adult Rated stuff, I suppose! I really love ASOIAF Series, the Warrior Cats Series is especially my big love since I've been little (I own every book lmao). Guardian's of Ga'Hoole, Unwind Series, Poetry Books, LOTR Series, and things like that!\n\nGames I have a bigger array- I grew up a Nintendo Kid, but I've done a lot more PC Gaming and PS4 Gaming recently. I've been playing Stardew Valley, Persona 5, Tales of Symphonia, Animal Crossing and Pokemon Moon recently! I really love playing Cooking Mama, Bloodbourne, Dragon Age Inquisition, The Forest, Cat Tails and stuff like that! I've played nearly every Zelda Game, and my favorites are between Wind Waker and Twilight Princess. I like to watch a lot of Let's Plays, though, so I have an opinion/experience with a bunch of games! (Loving that poor life I wish I could buy all the games I love but what you gonna do lmao!)\n\n**Media I Enjoy:**\n\nI really love anime, fantasy, sci-fi, and etc. I'm very enthralled by the MCU, and I'm excited for Spiderman Home Coming. (My favorite is Guardians of the Galaxy, and I enjoyed Thor Ragnarok, and found it interesting how they continued his character change from Watiti's version of Ragnarok into Endgame, but also Hell Yeah for Captain America Sam!) My favorite movie is dumbly enough the Legend of the Guardians owl movie. I also love animated movies extremely, Dreamworks, Pixar and Disney all the same. Big fan of Star Wars, despite having not seen the newest movies (Though I will when I have the time lmao) I also really love horror movies, though I'm talking 70s-80s horror that I remember watching when I was little. I'm not very big into horrors like SAW and Final Destination- feel they're more for the gore factor than the thriller part, though I do enjoy a good gore-horror!\n\nI also really thoroughly enjoy Game of Thrones, Boku No Hero Academia, Mob Psycho 100, Supernatural, Naruto, etc etc for other examples of my interest in Shows. I've seen a lot of stuff, but those are my main things I've been enjoying as of late. This Is Us is the love of my life at the moment.\n\nAs for Youtubers, I really love Game Grumps, Roosterteeth as a Whole Production and their sibling companies, Shane Dawson, Good Mythical Morning, and similar things! I like to watch the drama, and issues in the Beauty Community on Youtube, as well as the Pet Community.\n\n**Music I Enjoy:** \n\nI really enjoy all kinds of music, though I love a lot of rock from the 70s-90s. Styx, Journey, Metallica, Ozzy, Black Sabbath, etc etc. At the same time, I enjoy a lot of country/pop from the 90s, since I grew up with that. I thoroughly enjoy Indie music as a whole, and other bands I've found myself invested in lately have been Sufjan Stevens, BTS, Sleeping at Last, Glass Animals, Mother Mother, Billie Eilish, Kagepro Songs, Oh Monsters And Men, Weeknd, etc etc. It's a big bunch! I essentially listen to any and all music.\n\nSo this is a big ass post, and I think I got all of it that I needed/wanted to, so I mean! If you want to talk about anything, or of that sort, I'd love to talk to anyone here!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

This will be long. I feel like if I load this with detail it will make it easier to understand. I am a 17(almost 18) year old male. I go to a private Christian school with less students with a public high school.  I will be a senior this coming school year. I have aspergers, but I feel like it has developed into other emotional problems too. I have had issues with depression for at least a couple years now. I don't think it was always about friendship, but it has been for some time now. I have been quiet pretty much my whole life. I have had few friends my whole life. But now, I am getting lonely around the friends I do have. I didn't initiate the conversation with them to try and be friends. They did all that. Now, I have a few friends, but am not really happy with them. They are pretty much the social popular kids with a bunch of friends while I'm sitting there all lonely. I don't know why they ever tried to be friends with me though. I don't know if they actually want to be my friend or if they feel sorry for me or if I'm a big joke or what.  I have no idea. They are just way above my status and I don't really like being with them all that much. I mostly hang out with them to give me something to do and to feel less lonely. Part of me feels like I'm at the wrong place to be to make friends I like. I have been with most of those people for 6 years now. None of them really seem like my type that would make me happy. Part of me wants to start over and try a different school but it's kinda a little late now that I'm going to be a senior. I have basically resorted to looking at all the grades to find some sense to go with. Out of everyone in that school, I have found I think 1 person who catches my eye as someone who I would like to be friends with. Only she is almost 4 years younger than me I think and 3 grades behind me and she told me she's going to the public school next year. I am pretty much lost.

I just figured reddit would be a good way to post.\n\nIn the Past, I had this close friend from elementary. Her mom warned me about her being a socialpath and was not a good friend to her other friends always asking for money. At the time I did not want to listen to the mom and wanted to develop my own judgement. Throughout the years, the friendship we shared was very one sided. She expected me to listen to her stories and her interests with shows or guys. I expressed there was bad times at home but she dismissed it as \"everyone goes through bad times and it is not just you.\" Our friendship started to drift apart. Back in middle school... when I moved to a better area of the city. She thinks I'm rich and well off. When that is not the case. \n\nSo one day... she reached out and asked for a little bit for rent. It was starting off to be $20. I gave her it. She told me her children needed diapers. Asked for a bit more. I gave her $20. It piled with the stories and it was about $200 given. She re-assured and kept postponing the date of when she was gonna return it. I got really frustrated and told her I can't because of plans coming up. Yet, she guilted and asked again at 3am during my vacation. \n\nI got frustrated that she was interfering with my vacation. I rarely get a vacation and she knew about it too. I posted on facebook a very passive aggressive status about being asked for money.\n\nThat is when she unfriended me. Posted her own passive aggressive status. About rich people will never know how it feels to live by themselves. \n\nI reached out to her mom and big brother. Turned out she been asking from a  lot of people.  Her mom told me I should have known better because she did warned me about her.  She got her to send me the money. My \"friend\" flipped out at me and took it out on me. Saying I ruined her relationship with her mom and brother. Like dude?? I just lent you money. \n\nI am not rich. My parent is a refugee. My 2 family members are on disability. We got money from the government. It was the time of hard times that taught my family to save money. We moved to a better area of the city for this reason. \n\nLater on, I never logged onto my old facebook until recently. I saw she sent me a message saying \"Hi... (my name)....you there?\"\n\nI just miss her at times but I do not like how she treated me. What do you think?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}
{"post_id": "bzg8at", "created_utc": 1560277630, "title": "I don't like drinking with my friend anymore", "author": "kaleidoscope26", "self_text": "We have a small work place of about 20 people and before we were coworkers, we were good friends. Recently we've been having small coworker parties and so far at every party she's had a guy basically on her which wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that we work with these people. She likes to give in to alcohol and becomes overly drunk and clingy. We like to have wholesome bonding and drinking parties. We usually have these at my friend's small apartment. Most of us don't like to be an audience to people trying and hookup or makeout.\n\nParty #1: At a coworker's house. After everyone left, it was me (Fem), her, the coworker (Male) who lives there, and another coworker (Male, let's call him \"A\") who has a girlfriend who works with us. She drunkenly let A feel her up under blankets in front of us way too long before she apparently stopped him (Nobody else noticed bc A was pretending to be asleep and we were all drunk/tired too). She told me what happened and said she just couldn't process it and believe it was happening but even then wouldn't most people automatically slap the hand away before it reaches down below? She also says she felt awful she let it happen because she's friendly with his gf and they talk at work a lot. \n*I tried to be supportive, it happened and there wasn't much that could be done. She and \"A\" agreed to pretend it didn't happen and we all moved on. \"A\" doesn't know that I know.\n\nParty #2: She got very cuddly with this new coworker we hired and got very cuddly with him on the floor. I jokingly interrupted them a little because some of us were uncomfortable being an audience to it. This was at her small apartment and it was kind of just distracting everyone. Everyone left, I stayed over in her room and she ended up sleeping with him in her mom's room. I was just really glad I never woke up in the middle of the night to hear anything.\n\nParty #3: At her small apartment again. I know people tend to be more physically friendly when drunk but a coworker had invited a good friend. She's gone out to eat with both of them a few times so she already knew him. That mutual friend spent the entire time basically head on her thighs the whole night though.\n\nSmall party #4 (Wasn't really a party but is ultimately what made me really judge her): \"A\" invited us to his house to drink and I just figured why not. I was stressed out that week and needed anything that would give me a break. (\"A\" doesn't know that I know about the previous incident). Basically they weren't very subtle because he was fairly drunk and my friend ate a good amount of edibles. He left his room to go to the bathroom and she just muttered something she thought was an excuse and walked out. I went to get water from the kitchen and basically walked in on them making out in the kitchen. After that I went to grab something from my car and could hear them shuffling on the bed before I walked in. A third time I went to the bathroom and forgot to give them time and walked in just as he got off her. I never said anything, acted natural, and I played it off as being too drunk to notice. (I never drink to the point of unawareness, I hold my liquor well and I'm not stupid). \"A\" is an idiot and probably thinks he was sneaky, my friend probably thinks I know. I was really annoyed after this because not only does it make it incredibly awkward and uncomfortable for me but I just wish they could've controlled themselves long enough so I wouldn't have found out. I don't want to see the gf at work and be plagued with guilty knowledge.\n\nI haven't talked to her about it and I'm not going to. I'm the type of person to make other people's problems my responsibility and I'm trying to teach myself not to do that. Starting with paying less attention to whatever she's doing and just focus on having a good time myself. It's her life and I'm not nor should I have to be her babysitter. She knows her choices are wrong and I'm sure she knows what I'll say too. I'm willing to help her out as best as I can with any aftermath but I'm not going to spend my parties monitoring her and keeping her in check.\n\nIt's been a week and I can't really move past this. I've kept my behavior with her normal and just written things off as being stressed at work. I've been ignoring \"A' at work without being too obvious too. I get put in a bad mood everytime I look at him. He's a total pig but it takes two to tango and my friend at this point is as equally guilty. Part of me knows that I'm jealous of how every male coworker seems to like her but with this last incident I can't help but judge her as the workplace thot. At this point I kind of just want to ignore her at coworker parties and avoid drinking with her in small groups.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I've played lots of LoL, FFXIV and CSGO previously. Also even played a little bit of Pathfinder once. (I just rp'd, my friend explained the mechanics to me so I never got past the noob level)\n\nIn terms of TV shows I'm currently watching Billions, Chernobyl and Battlebots. All really good shows in my opinion that I'd really recommend! My favourite series though would probably be GoT (Season 1-4~).\n\nThen movies have also been a big interest in my life. I usually am really into animated movies such as Spiderman, Big hero 6, Up, etc. Also enjoy some action and romance movies.\n\nI am looking for people who're in Australia to chat to, so if I sound interesting and we sound like a good fit hit me up. We can talk on whatever really works for the both of us, I prefer discord but have basically every messaging service.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

So for starters, I\u2019m a former critical care Field Training Officer Paramedic and Search &amp; Rescue team member. I love my job beyond imagination, but I had a latent rare genetic disease trigger and it\u2019s utterly destroyed my once active, adrenaline filled life. For those who may be interested, it\u2019s an auto inflammatory disease as opposed to an autoimmune one. Typically, it causes fevers and flu like symptoms that last for weeks on end. But sometimes, it goes really nuts and attacks my body. It did just that the middle of last month, and I\u2019ve been in the hospital more than not since then.\n\nI\u2019ve really lost touch with all my IRL friends, and I\u2019m incredibly lonely. I know I\u2019m a bit older than the going person here, but here\u2019s me in a nutshell:\n\n* I love rambling, stimulating, intelligent conversation!! I find intellectual people very sexy.\n\n\n* I\u2019m a total bibliophile! I have quite the personal library! Love to read history, thrillers, war books (non fiction), sci fi, historical fiction, spirituality (Buddhism, Shinto, Bushiso, Earth based spirituality), fantasy... lots of genres. \n\n* I\u2019m a violinist, played with the symphony. Music is a huge outlet for me, and I listen to a very eclectic mix of genres such as: classical, Pagan music, Viking music (Wardruna, Danheim, etc), some Metal (think Metallica, AC/DC, Disturbed, Three Days Grace, Rammstein, etc.), Folk music (Blackmore\u2019s Night, Solas), groups like Dead Can Dance, Faun, Mediaeval Babes, etc.... I love 80\u2019s music, Celtic music, and world music, too!\n\n* I love board and card games, trivial knowledge, road trips, camping, museums, theater... Nature is both my sanctuary and my church. I\u2019m very connected with Mother Earth and all Her children.\n\n* And I love movies! Many genres, but war, 80\u2019s, historical fiction, action, superhero, sci fi, horror... and loads of animated are some of my favorite genres !! \n\n* I also love arts and crafts!! Alas, I am usually too sick to create much anymore. But I love beadwork, jewelry making, acrylic painting, sculpting with clay... and working with yummy yarns, like bamboo/silk blends!\n\nSo, anyway, If it sounds interesting to you, I\u2019d love to hear from you! I am on Kik...  Just let me know! (I also have what\u2019s app, iMessage, google hangouts.)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

{"post_id": "bztwhr", "created_utc": 1560359734, "title": "Social Misconstruction Misconstrued", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "As a person seeking a friend, my goal is to interest an audience that interests me, but how far does this go? We act fluidly,  we don't act a fool in front of our bosses, but we might in front of family, we act a bit meaner in front of friends (teasing and whatnot) and act nicer in front of significant others (depends on the dynamic, but this is the majority case). But is such fluid personality deceitful? Does acting different mean you are lying about who you are? In my unprofessional and uneducated and undeveloped opinion, it's a matter of intent, really. When we are lied to, it usually is with good intent. Most lies are white lies, little pieces of deception in order to spare feeling that need not be broken. While we may get upset if we learn that we were lied to, we don't hate being lied to, we hate knowing that we have been lied to, so we will often purposefully turn a blind eye to it. It gets complicated when we inspect the grey area of actions that we haven't collectively defined as lying or not, and even so, we don't even know if said lying is immoral.   \n\n\nI am of the mind that they way we act around different company is part of our personality, how compliant we are to norms and when we draw the line, how much this norm actually affects us on a conscious/subconscious level and how much it doesn't. When we act dignified on the job, that is usually deliberate and purposefully deceitful, but it has little harm in most cases, so no one cares, really. (Variable) When we act \"meaner\" with friends, it's not that we are acting meaner with friend, it's that we aren't acting this way around everyone else. Means the exact same thing in literature, but in nuance there is a difference, that is, which one is a deliberate action. We might think that an outfit would look ugly on a stranger and never admit to it, but we would be certain to tell a friend it. We don't know how the stranger would react, they might have their feelings hurt or they might swing at you, who knows? But we know exactly how a friend will react and we also know that we want to make sure they don't embarrass themselves, while a stranger you meet is likely already doing this. With this in mind, we can learn that our behavior isn't a matter of deceit for personal benefits (in this case, at least) but for others' and our benefit/minimized cost. Generally, when actions are only or mostly for one's own benefits, they are immoral, but if they are for others', they are noble.   \n\n\nWhat about \"spiffying-up\"? The act we put on we we talk to new people, when we put our best foot forward. Well, it's exactly that, unless we are deliberately saying/lying about our negative traits, then it's not lying, it's simply omitting. (Note that lies of omission are \"a thing.\") That much isn't a concern, but what about feigning interest? That's lying, and it is, but it is with the benefit of the other person and yourself. It spares their feelings and gives you a better impression, continuing on with it to a very believable manner is not warranted, though. (In my opinion, as all of this is) If it's in the zone where you are just interested enough to keep a person happy enough to want to talk to you again, it's not really immoral as it is for a mutual benefit (and it's very likely that you are both doing it) but it's going to be a degree that we all know we are lying, but not so much to be saddened, just enough to brush it off and go with it anyways.   \n\n\nOf course, the morality isn't what I am concerned with, but the intricacies and how we automatically know where the line stops on a subconscious level, but the second we try to make it conscious, things get fuzzy.   \n\n\nHope this interested you, have a lovely day!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I have really bad anxiety (so bad that my mum is going to have to call the school and tell them I can\u2019t do PE anymore cause that\u2019s house bad my social anxiety it), I have body issues that have been changing over the years. In year 7 I was anorexic but now I know I\u2019m really skinny and It\u2019s impossible for me to gain weight. \u2018Jess\u2019 claims to have anxiety and body issues and says that \u2018I don\u2019t have body issues\u2019 when clearly I do. I just does go around talking about it. \n\nI while ago \u2018Jess\u2019 and this other \u2018friends\u2019 let\u2019s call him \u2018Alex\u2019 we\u2019re talking about how \u201cfat\u201d they are and they always joke about it. And I always TRY and make a \u201cJOKE\u201d saying \u2018I\u2019m so THICC hahah\u2019 to try and cope with the fact I\u2019m incredibly skinny and I\u2019m not comfortable with it. But whenever I say that they\u2019re always like \u2018you\u2019re not funny, stop\u2019 and \u2018can you stop saying that, it\u2019s really offensive\u2019 and I get why they\u2019re saying, it could be offensive to some people BUT THEY NEVER ASK WHY I DO IT! they never ask! NEVER! So I have just to sit there while they\u2019re having a huge go at me.\n\nNext bit, so literally on Monday I was like to \u2018Jess\u2019 I was actually talking about myself. I said \u2018I had a huge fucking breakdown last night\u2019 (it was cause of Body issues and anxiety) and it almost seemed like she didn\u2019t believe a thing I said. She literally said to me \u2018Oh I hate it when people say that\u2019. She was basically saying \u2018yeah, no you didn\u2019t. Shut the fuck up\u2019 and I felt so fucking upset, so I didn\u2019t talk again for the rest of that lesson. I barely talk about my mental health and when I do I get fucking shouted at.\n\nSo today I had PE last lesson and I was feeling extra fucking upset today because life is shit. Do you know what I did while getting changed. Stayed quiet. Why? Because why would people talk to me. While \u2018Jess\u2019 and let\u2019s call her \u2018Annie\u2019 we\u2019re having a nice talk I was sat there awkwardly in the middle. And I started to think, am I just a toy to them? I have always been there for \u2018Jess\u2019! ALWAYS! I want to say someone to her, but will she listen? No! She doesn\u2019t believe I have problems!\n\nIn PE today (still) we were in the fitness room, so you think I got talked to by \u2018Jess\u2019 and \u2018Annie\u2019? NO! So everyone had to work in pairs and when out teacher said that I nearly broke down. I worked by myself the whole lesson because I really had the people I have in my PE. A friend I\u2019ve known my whole life is joining my school soon so I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll be in my PE so I won\u2019t be alone. \n\nNow let\u2019s talk about the bitch that is \u2018Annie\u2019.\nNow me and \u2018Annie\u2019 has dated once, it was only for a few days, but we dated. When we broke up she said \u2018please don\u2019t make it awkward now\u2019 and I said I wouldn\u2019t. But then when I come back to school, guess what she does? Makes it awkward by ignoring me. Also apparently she told \u2018Jess\u2019 to tell me (and I quote) \u201cDont come near me or talk to me until I talk to you\u201d. Do you know how long ago she said that? WEEKS AGO! I\u2019ve had no one to talk to in PE for weeks cause \u2018Annie\u2019 is being bitch and ignoring me and \u2018Jess\u2019 is on \u2018Annie\u2019s\u2019 side. \n\nI\u2019m also the push-over friend and everyone I hang out with know that. They can literally beat the shit out of me and bully me everyday. They do this cause they know they can get away with it because I\u2019m too nice and too scared to stand up for myself. I\u2019m scared because I stood up for myself once and I got ragged and beaten. So yeah. I have to say sorry for everything, even though I never do anything wrong. \nI know I should probably get new friends, but I can\u2019t because I\u2019m scared. So I have to say with the people I\u2019m with now. Not every one I hang out with is spiteful, some people i lush but yeh. I can\u2019t leave them. My anxiety has been worse lately so my mum is calling my school tomorrow and telling them to not let me do PE anymore or at least for a while.\n\nSorry that was a lot of writing. Sorry. I know there is nothing anyone can do, I just need to vent. Sorry", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of option, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person. \n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers). \n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values). \n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

It was few weeks later that this redditor decided to delete both their reddit account and now I suppose an alias email. All I'm left with is messages, that when printed on a US letter sized paper, could lead to a 400+ page booklet, with no margins. Not expecting to resume our conversation but at least I need a closure so that I can move on.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Don't worry about those I'm already talking with I will still talk with you. Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nI just recently graduated from college with a degree in film. I suffer from both anxiety and depression. It effects me a lot on day to day basis mostly depression. Some days I'm fine Some I'm not. So if I complain about being depressed please understand I can't control it and at least be sympathetic towards it.\n\nI'm also somewhere on the spectrum. Its not as severe as other people probably, like you wouldn't think It because I'm on the high functioning side of the spectrum.

I have a hard time making conversation so I might be boring to talk to. I will try my best. I don't have much in life as I'm searching for work at the moment. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Big Little Lies, The Handmaid's Tale, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03.

It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have a Kik, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now.

During this lunch we made a plan to do something on the weekend (specifically Saturday night) which would involve drinking. It was something that I didn't think was going to happen/ had no actual confonformation was happening. Also we joked about dressing up so I wasn't sure how serious it was. \n\nCut to the next day I'd basically forgotten about the 'plan' with these 3 friends and on the groupchat (has me, those 3 friends and another 2 of my best friends in it - all of us 18) I asked: \n\"Is this sunday fathers day?\"  \n\nAnd I got the reply \"I think so\"\n\nSo then said \"rip our dads\". My meaning being if we don't even know for sure it's fathers day then rip them. \n\nThen one of my best friends who didn't come to the lunch asks a little later: \n\n\"You said rip our dads as if something is happening on sunday that would stop it. What's happening on sunday?\" \n\nTo that I respond: \"it's father's day on Sunday so rip our dads since none of us know\" \n(Words to that effect - The conversation doesn't seem important but it comes into play later) \n\nSo it's the next day and I was supposed to go out with that best friend and one of my friends from the lunch to the cinema. I couldn't end up going since I had a family thing. At this family thing I had a bit to drink. So when I'm in the car home (don't worry my mum was driving) I get a message from her saying: \n\"what's happening with Saturday?\"\nAnd I respond \"Saturday???\" \n\nEssentially when the two went out my best friend (18F) had asked the friend (the one male) who was at the lunch what their plans on Saturday were. The friend had said that they didn't think they were supposed to say what we were doing since I had apparently been the one to make it a secret. The secret being that we were going out Saturday. Me saying \"rip our dads\" according to the lunch friend was me saying that in relation to Saturday since we'd be drinking and staying out really late. \n\nSo my best friend took this as me going out of my way to exclude her and specifically not tell her the plans about Saturday. The fathers day conversation being me actively doing that.\n\nWhich from her perspective and me responding \"Saturday???\" I could see why it may come across that way. However I honestly didn't think Saturday was happening since we had been joking and the whole premise of the plan was ridiculous and, 2 it hadn't been confirmed or mentioned since. So I'd completely forgotten about it and also if I'd known it was definitely happening I'd of mentioned it before Saturday. \n\nIt's all very stupid but I'm very stressed over it so I'd appreciate any advice I can get. I feel like my friend is pretty hurt and pissed at me since she thinks I, her best friend, tried to exclude her but I literally had no reason to. I feel like no matter what way you look at it, I come across as the bad guy since things I've said have been taken in a different context. \n\nWe have spoken a bit since she confronted me about the Saturday thing but she didn't respond to my last message. \nSaturday is no longer happening since on the group chat that we're all in it was decided this weekend was a good time to do it. Which is one of the reasons I never mentioned or intentionally alluded to it since I never thought it would actually happen.\n\n(This isnt the only advice place I've posted it, I'm trying to get the most advice I can get.)

How do you gently break it to someone that you don't wish to be friends with them without hurting their feelings ? Generally people tend to get the hint but I really feel bad ignoring them and some people keep contacting you to go and hang out with them. Perhaps hurting their feelings is unavoidable but what is the best way to go about this?\n\nI am talking of situations where there's nothing wrong with that person, they are respectable and nice people it is just that similar to a romantic relationship, you cannot force a platonic connection with everyone either. There is no vibe, and I get very bored and platonically unfulfilled when being around these people. Usually there is nothing much in common with these people and the conversations just seem forced and reach a dead end as well.\n\nSo any advice if anyone else has been through this? How do you reject someone who wants to be your friend but you don't see it happening?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I really think I need to socialize more and find some new people to try and befriend. I'm quite depressed and anxious so this could really help me out. Here are some of my hobbies so you can kinda get a feel for me:\n\nGaming: I love video games, they're an amazing experience. I particularly love RPG's like Dark Souls, Final Fantasy, Monster Hunter, Pokemon, and God Eater. I also am a huge Nintendo fan and grew up playing lots of N64 and Gamecube games, the Banjo-Kazooie games being personal favourites of mine. I hope I'll be able to design my own games someday.\n\nMusic: I'm a huge nerd for music, particularly Power/Symphonic Metal. They boost my mood like nothing else. I also listen to some Porter Robinson occasionally. I hope to one day be a vocalist for my own Power Metal group.\n\nAnime: I'm pretty fond of anime. I've watched a good couple series, but Romance is probably my favourite genre aside from Action/Shounen. If you want to talk about SoL or other genres though, I'll definitely be interested, I'm always open to new shows.\n\nAside from that, I'm a good listener so if you ever want someone to vent to, I'll listen to you. I also try my best to be as supportive and understanding as I can be. I only ask that you're willing to listen to me and be supportive sometimes in return.\n\nSo if it feels like you might want to hit me up and chat about whatever, feel free to PM me. We can talk through Reddit or Discord, whichever works for you. Thank you very much for listening to me.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

At the previous college I went to, I had a total of 3 friends from the actual university. Two of which I met at orientation and ended up having all 4 classes with them... even though there\u2019s 50,000 kids at the school? - and the other one is a family friend who I\u2019ve known my whole life. Every other friend I had went to a different nearby college or didn\u2019t go to college, and I had met them through Arts shows, coffee shops, etc. (the normal less awkward way to meet friends). I\u2019m from a big city so it wasn\u2019t a lame college town that ONLY had college kids. \n\nEven in high school I had like 5 friends that actually went to high school with me and I had known them all since I was kid. If I ever hung out with a classmate outside of school, the purpose was to smoke weed at a sesh circle. Every other friend was made through concerts, sports (I used to play volleyball, and planned on pursuing professionally until I realized student athletes r literal slaves), yoga classes, etc. High school was rough because nobody wanted to make new friends...\n\nNaturally I dropped out of college because I hated school and I don\u2019t like the atmosphere of college so I told my parents to stop wasting money. I moved cities and my friendship spread like wildfire. After living there for a 1 month, I found myself stressed about the number of people I had to please in my life but I didn\u2019t care! These were my people and I had a job and my life quality skyrocketed. Until my parents forced me to go back to college....\n\nSo I transferred to UO which is in Eugene, Oregon. It is the cutest college town I\u2019ve ever seen but it\u2019s still a college town which means only college things to do. And I\u2019ve had such a hard time making friends. I tried joining clubs especially the outdoors club. I even went on a school trip and I still haven\u2019t made any friends. I have 1 person that I met at a coffee shop but other than that mostly homeless people and pretentious college kids that DONT want to expand their friend group hang around there. It\u2019s been difficult for me because I\u2019ve grown up always having a lot of friends and in an atmosphere where everyone is ALWAYS excited to meet new people. Now that I\u2019m in college, it seems like the thing to do is just make a group of friends at welcome week and then never talk to another human being besides those people ever again.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to make friends? \n\nSorry for all the negativity in this post.

We attend the same college and were in the same program. I appreciated her input in class and she always gave me good feedback on my writing. As we took more courses together, we got closer. I was moving off campus and May was graduating and starting a grad program, so we decided to live together. Cue the best friendship of my life, for about a year.\n\nSince we moved in together, things have really turned around, starting with another roommate. May would complain to me for hours about how this girl treated her and how bad it made her feel, but when I confronted the other roommate about her behaviour, May would front like she had never said any of that and there were no problems at all. It was a rift that solved itself because the other girl moved out, but it still bugs me a lot.\n\nAnd things have just been increasingly getting hard for me to deal with. I thought we were best friends and she didn't say happy birthday to me, and didn't come to my graduation. But on her birthday I made a big deal out of it, etc. It just feels really one sided. \n\nNot to mention we have totally different lifestyles. I've basically had to teach her how to live on her own. I handle bills and do most of the chores (she washes dishes once in a while). She is kind of a pig; trashes everything, doesnt bathe regularly, stuff like that. That's not my business as a friend but as a roommate it is, and it makes cohabitating hard. It's been a year and she still hasn't learned to clean up after herself or chip in for groceries. \n\nI woke up this morning on my day off fo fond her home as well. I've been in bed for the past two hours because I don't want to go downstairs and be around her. This avoiding her has started to become regular practice. \n\nI guess I'm just asking for advice. I'm not sure what I should do. She hates confrontation and just runs away crying if there's any danger of a disagreement so I don't know if I should just live here for the next year resenting her or ask her to move, or move out myself, or attempt a weird conversation that ends up with her feelings hurt anyway.\n\nWhat would reddit do?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "c0olmp", "created_utc": 1560542558, "title": "Thinking of ending my relationship with my best friend", "author": "prima_juris", "self_text": "note: apologies in advance, English isn't my first language\n\nBackground: I met my best friend (I'll call her Caroline) in college, five years ago. We were in the same program and often helped each other in class. Her good grades inspired me to take my own studies more seriously. Eventually, we went to different universities, but she convinced me after a year or so to come to her uni, which was quite far from my hometown. So, from fall 2017 to spring 2019, we lived together at the university residence. Overall, it was a great experience, we spent a lot of time talking late at night about everything (life, future, projects, family, etc.), having movie marathons... I also enjoyed having more freedom for myself, even though I missed my parents from time to time.\n\nAs of now, uni is over and we are both back to our respective home. I've been sick for the last two weeks (nothing serious, I'm back to normal), but it gave me a lot of time to reflect on my friendship with Caroline, trying to pinpoint the feelings I experienced during finals week.\n\nBut before, I should mention that in our five years of friendship, we have never had any disputes or arguments. We get along very well, to the point where some of our mutual acquaintances thought we were a couple. I always laughed it off, but I discovered in fall 2018 that Caroline actually had romantic feeling towards me. She didn't want me to know, as she was fine keeping her fantasies to herself. I think this is where things started going downhill, but we tried our best to keep our friendship intact. Eventually, Caroline said her feelings faded away, and we went back to being friends.\n\nDuring Spring break, she admitted to having a crush on a girl in our classes (let's call her Marie). Now, Marie and Caroline never talked to each other, but Caroline still elaborated complex fantasies of what-if-we-were-a-couple and whatnot, even going as far as writing a short collection of poems about Marie for one of her writing classes, hoping that Marie would connect the dots. They eventually started to exchange message texts, going to caf\u00e9s and generally spending time together. I didn't feel any jealousy, as I thought it was refreshing to see Caroline approaching new people and opening up to them. But she kept clinging to the idea of forming a relationship with Marie, while it was clear she wasn't interested.\n\nFastforward to finals week. Caroline was a complete mess, and even as her best friend, I honestly stopped caring for her antics. She lied to our teachers about having anxiety issues so she would have more time to finish her essays, and she still had not turned in her midterm papers. She would propose to study together and to watch a movie in the evening, but cancel everything to go see Marie and her friends. She would then come back half drunk at three AM or even later. I had a lot of work to focus on, so it provided me the perfect excuse to ignore her until I could go back home.\n\nCaroline has since presented her excuses, admitting she wasn't really herself during that week and coming to the conclusion that she deluded herself about the whole Marie thing. She wasn't worried about me being mad at her, saying she knew \"our friendship was stronger than that\". But I'm starting to have doubts about that. A lot of things about her now annoy me, starting with her narcissistic personality. The fact that she can't relate to anything unless she sees herself in it. Her pretentiousness/fake-deep attitude, how she lets her parents control her while fantasizing about rebelling against them and manipulating them. I feel like she's having her teenage crisis now, at 25 years old.\n\nUltimately, I can't say I hate her. I'm mostly disappointed. I keep thinking maybe I just need a break from her, but at the same time I don't think things will ever go back to what they were. I miss our late night talks, our complicity, our wild hypotheses about the universe. But I think we have reached the end of what we could achieve together.\n\nAny thoughts? I've been rambling a lot and I'm not sure if everything is clear. I just wanted to talk, I guess.\nThanks for reading.\n\n(Edit: formatting, sorry for the wall of text)", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Am I worrying to much since A and D don't mind? or Is C right to get away if am not confortable enough with the way thing are now even tho we have being together for 6 years and are my only friends?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for the advise!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

After 7th grade she became best friends with another girl (F17) of our same friendship group. No problems, our entire group was fine up until high when we all split ways to go to different high schools. My exfriend and I remained friends as we went to the same school. Her bestfriend went to another school. We were inseparable our entire school career. This year, junior (11) year I got a boyfriend (M17) around November. All of us were extremely close. We had class together and he helped me realize how toxic my past relationship was. A month later we were having an issue with trust and broke it off, but we both knew we still had extreme love for each other. Following our break up, my exfriend, my ex, and her bestfriend had Facetimed and her bestfriend took an interest in him. They start talking and eventually start dating very quickly. I'm not gonna deny I was hurt but I wasnt going to let that get in the way of friendship I still had with both my ex and exfriend. \n\nThe falling out: I knew my ex still loved me and he didn't have feelings for the girl he was dating. He is someone that won't stand up for himself when someone pushes something onto him. So when my exfriend kept pushing him into dating her bestfriend he didnt back down. I know this is wrong of me and honesty I do feel like a homewrecker. I let my feelings for him control me rather than my actual care for him. I told him it was wrong that he was leading her on and lying everytime he told her he loved her. He confessed that he wanted to end things with her but couldnt find a way to do it. Now this part sounds irrelevant but it stuck out to me; he is extremely close with his mom and had me meet her the very second he could, however, with her he didnt even want his mom about her. Eventually I told him he should break it off if the feelings werent genuine. He did. About two weeks after their break up we started talking more romanticly and started dating again. We decided not to say anything about it but if people asked then we would confirm it. One day after the class we shared with exfriend, we were holding hands and she was walking in front of us. She turned around, saw our hands then turned back around to walk away. After school she texted both of us asking if we were going to say anything to her, to which we both replied, \"No, we didn't tell anyone either.\" That lead to her ignoring the both of us and posting things on snapchat directed at us, such as the spongebob meme with the caption \"We didnt tell anyone,\" \"I respect your relationship,\". The latter directed at me as I had said before I respected his relationship, which I meant. I truly didnt mean to have him break uo with her to be with me. I genuinely thought it wasnt a good idea to fake feelings in the relationship. Looking back at it know I can see that my judgement was also clouded and maybe that was the true motive that I tried to find excuses to deny. My exfriend and her bestfriend continued to bash our relationship and myself whenever they could until he couldnt take it and we broke up. After she immediately started reconnecting with him and ignoring me. We talked when we had to but that was it.\n\nReaching out: The events in January and it's currently June. My ex friend and are civil but I've been considering reaching out and apologizing. I just dont know what I should say or if I should at all. Some of our mutual friends say that I should just let it be as we only have senior year left, while others say I should reach out just let things settle out and theres no bad blood for going into senior year. \n\nSo reddit I need outside advice on what to do.

He was the first person I ever told that to, and he was insanely supportive. He gave me my first binder (he had an extra and he is trans too), and he helped me come out to our friends. We quickly became super close friends and shared a ton of interests with each other. We met up all the time and talked constantly. Then once the school year started up again (we go to the same high school) we hung out more and had a mutual friend group. \n\nThen this year, I noticed that my friend was kind of being a bit toxic and I was in a very dark place, so I distanced myself from him. I felt bad about it at the time, but it was just for the best for me.\n\nThen in January, he got into an argument with one of our other close friends, I tried to talk to him to get him to calm down and see the other point of view. Instead, directly after I said \"hey\" he told me to fuck off and blocked me. The blocking hurt the most as he knew I only saw that as a measure to completely get someone to never talk to you again, so him doing that so easily was painful.\n\nA week later he messaged me again and started agressively lecturing me about the argument and how he was right. I tried to give him my point of view in the calmest, most objective way I could, and he instead started saying very hurtful things to me and didnt apologize for anything. I eventually got very done, and gave him my points with a full explanation (still trying to be objective and not be mean) and then I blocked him back. He then messaged another one of our mutual friends who had nothing to do with any of it, and had them relay me the message that we werent friends anymore. Then an hour later he went to a social media that I dont use and started asking our friends for pity because he \"lost a friend who was asking stupid questions, and now he feels lonelier than ever\". That still sticks with me because he was the one to break off our friendship, and then he asked for pity.\n\nAnyways, that brings me to today, where he asked to meet up after I sent him just a nice text about something I found for his favorite anime. I met up with him and he instantly launched into how he felt about the argument and why he acted so agressively. He gave a shitty excuse, and then I told him that I understood why he acted that way, and how I shouldn't have tried to join in his argument with our friend, and I apologized. He then continued on to tell me explicitly that all my original arguments (that broke off our friendship) were wrong, and he did not apologize.\n\n We then moved on and talked about other stuff for 2 hours and caught up with each other's lives, and he said he wanted to be friends again. \n\nI just dont think I can be friends with him anymore, as his lack of ability to even try and see my point of view or even own up and apologize shows that he hasnt changed at all. And really I think something like that ugly argument will happen again if we kept being friends. So reddit, I would like to know:\n\nHow do I politely tell him that I dont want to be friends again?\n\nI do not want to ghost him as that just doesnt seem right, but I also dont want to make it seem like it is his fault or cause another argument.\n\nThank you so much if you read this far, I really appreciate it!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

My real name is Francis, my favorite movie is The Dark Knight, but don't worry, Jack is from an alternate reality comic where Joker is the hero called White Knight, which I got for Christmas, but we had a Heroic, Reformed Jack in our system for about three years before that, he just never had a comic to look at for inspiration and point to and say \"that is me\" and post on his blog like he is making now. I am writing this post while I've got my wits together but already Jack is getting impatient I can't sit still he really wants to be the one to make a friend, and I can see why.  We weren't ready to let him control the body, our system had some truama to work out, we kept him locked in a cell in Arkham Asylum and his subsystem, Jack (25, the body is 25,) Little Jackie (11) and Joker (uses too much capitolization, tries to be funny and laughs a lot, cannot hurt you over the internet). We had to get stable on meds and the Joker was keeping some of our personalities hostage.

I have a lot of friends, but they are all people who rolled into adult life with me from high school or people who were roommates at one time or another, maybe the occasional work friend. \nThey\u2019re fine people, but we are mates through circumstance more than anything else. I\u2019ve moved on to a new phase of my life where my interests are so far removed from theirs that I don\u2019t hang out with them anymore, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to see them, it\u2019s that I no longer want to engage in the activities where I would see them. \n\nWoe is me, I used to be cool. \n\nDo you guys have this problem? I tried to force myself to go to parties and bars with friends, or talk on the phone with them, but it\u2019s got to the point where I get irritated now when they invite me out.

Which is why new friends are great; there are so many stories to share, bonus if you share interests once you run out. \n\nI\u2019m really feeling it now, semester is over at uni and I have nothing but work (extremely uneventful admin job) to focus on, so the loneliness gets crushing sometimes, especially weekends. \n\nHow are you?", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}
{"post_id": "c0u1jg", "created_utc": 1560577699, "title": "Am I a bad friend?", "author": "IcyPalate97", "self_text": "  \n\nI am going to be changing my friends names of course for further anonymity. My female friend is named Millie and my guy friend is named Lake. I've known Millie for a long time, since 2nd grade, but we didn\u2019t become best friends until middle school. We had hung out in 5th grade but drama in the friend group lead me to siding with one of the girls and her siding with the other. We had no beef with each other tho. Once middle school hit and we were in the same homeroom we bonded through the fact that we knew each other from elementary and our love for Naruto. She introduced me to creepypastas which I got into so we would have more to talk about and I liked making characters and writing. As she introduced me to creepypastas she also introduced me to her best friend Lake. We would all 3 Skype a lot of the time but me and Lake wouldn\u2019t really talk much unless Millie was there. Soon I was inviting them over to have birthday sleepovers and they were doing the same for me. Lake and I never really hung out alone outside of these birthday sleepovers, but me and Millie would see each other at school and hang out alone because of that. (Lake is a year younger than us and went to a different middle school.) Soon high school arrived and Millie and I were no longer in the same school. I went to the same high school as my older sister and Millie went to her neighborhood school. We still texted and talked most of the time but it was much harder since we couldn\u2019t see each other very often and she had an odd sleeping schedule, so sometimes it would take a while for her to text back. \n\nAround Junior year I asked Lake to start watching Teen Wolf because it was a show I really liked and I knew he kind of liked the same things. I also got him into reading the HP books which he also enjoyed. At that point since we all went to different schools, the only time we saw each other was when we had birthday sleepovers, and maybe New Years. Since Lake and I started to get into similar fandoms we started to talk more, sending each other funny pictures and updates on the Hogwarts Mystery game. I had wanted to show Lake the Harry Potter movies but we didn\u2019t really see each other because of conflicting schedules and the fact that my parents don\u2019t let me hang out with friends much. We figured that the only way we would get to watch them together was if he came a day earlier than we all planned to hang out. So he did and we watched the movies and had fun...and then we got hooked. He came over another time a day early and we watched Goblet of Fire and made funny quizzes together. It was when we planned to watch Order of the Phoenix that we realized it wouldn\u2019t be possible to come a day early because of school so we moved to another weekend entirely and hung out completely alone for the first time. Ironically enough we didn\u2019t even watch Order of the Phoenix, we watched the X-Men, which brought us even closer. \n\nAfter that we were hanging out completely alone more and more. For Halloween we biked around Lake\u2019s neighborhood in spandex suits (which I don\u2019t recommend), I came a day early for our new years celebration, Lake came over to mine so we could go to the fair and the comic book store, I went over to his and we recreated and recorded X-Men scenes and took aesthetic Harry Potter pictures, we were having a great time. In the mean-time I was still talking to Millie but truly I couldn\u2019t tell you what we were talking about. I would send her funny memes and we would talk about school but she really opened up to me or Lake for that matter. Lake and I tended to rant a lot about our feelings and our family and generally shit in our lives but Millie never really did that. I never knew what she was feeling and even when I asked I never felt like she truly told me so it was kind of hard to talk about anything other than school. We also weren\u2019t in a lot of the same fandoms which is very important to me because right now it\u2019s my entire life. So we were kind of drifting apart\u2026 I love Millie, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I feel like I just like Lake more\u2026 he\u2019s a lot less stressful to hang out with because I don\u2019t have to wonder if he\u2019s having fun and we can literally just talk to each other for hours and be content.

Can't wait to move out ASAP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A bit of a backstory:** This past week hasn't exactly been the best for me. I shattered one of my parent's car's tail light, tripped over the sidewalk and got a semi-huge scab on my forearm and knee,  was told by my doctor that there's something wrong with my kidney and that I'll need an ultra sound sometime soon, the kidney issue could potentially prevent me from moving abroad for work in a few months since the program that I got accepted to inquired me about the kidney problem, and then about an hour ago, I shattered one of those overhead glass-cover that covers the lights in houses. All of those things literally happened within the past 7 days.  Now having said all that, I thought the way I've been dealing with these mishaps were pretty good. But there were definitely times this past few days where I wish I can just get a hug or someone telling me that \"everything will be ok\" or like \"are you ok?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow onto the meat of this post. I've always thought that family are supposed to be people that you can trust, the people that you can fall back to when you need some sort of support (emotional, financial (if possible), and etc...). But after going through all of the things I've stated in the last paragraph, I realized in terms of emotional support, I got none of that. In fact, I realized how god dam toxic my family are in general. For instance, when I accidentally shattered the glass cover an hour ago and got blood all over my foot because of the glass, normally, I assume people's response would be \"are you ok?\", \"is your foot ok?\", \"do you need any bandage or anything?\". But nope, their response was yelling and complaining to me about how the glass probably can't be replaced and how expensive the light will cost to replace. Then afterwards, my older brother (who's god dam 28 by the way), came down and started to complain to my parents about me WHILE I was there trying to stop my foot from bleeding, going on about \"why is he  (me) breaking everything? You (my dad) are going to make him (me) pay for it right?\". \n\nLittle side note about my relationship with my brother. Basically to sum it up, it's **non existent**. To me at least. We've been fighting since I was born. And then when he went off to college when I was in high school, I more or less became the 'only child' at home until I went off to college. I've always thought that our relationship could get better as we get older. But that seems to not be happening because we still fought when we see each other. To go into a bit more detail about why we always fight. What usually happens is I would be minding my own business and then he would start get into my business (like the shattering glass example, where he asked my parents if I will be paying for replacement and stuff). As a result, I get really pissed off because **why can't he just mind your own god dam business?!**. I realized that in terms of personal development, I need to learn how to not get triggered when he does that (still work in progress). Another thing about him is that, he would ask me to share couple things that I pay for like Spotify, Steam accounts (for games that I bought), and etc... and when I said no, he'd get pissed and complain about how I should be nice and stuff (what a god damm hypocrite. L O L).\n\nAnyways, overall, I just wish that my family can provide any emotional support instead of yelling and telling me \"ha! I told you so, you should've done \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\". The way they responded after seeing the bruise on my forearm and knee, and telling them about my kidney problem, wasn't exactly comforting either. It's kinda funny (to me at least) that my parents always asked me why I am so secretive about my personal life and why that I don't share anything about my life with them like my brother does. To be quite honest, I think it all comes down to lack of emotional support. I feel like I will be wasting my time and that I will suffer mentally if I were to tell them anything about what's going on with my life (as shown the way they responded in the example above). I've been actually going to see counseling for anxiety. And something that I sometimes wonder and is in denial of right now is that maybe the root cause of my anxiety is related to how my parents treat me when I was growing up? I honestly don't know. I really wish that's not the case tho.\n\nOf course, everything I said is most likely bias as it is coming from my perspective. Maybe I am just wrong in all of the situation above. But that is just honestly how I feel at this moment. I also understand that there are people in worse situations than I am right now and I honestly feel like sometimes I don't have the right to complain knowing that that's the case. But I just need to let out some steam. So Thank you to those that read this.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

She\u2019s been my best friend for a few years, even tho I feel like we\u2019ve been getting more distant for the past few months, not in terms of talking or seeing each other, but in terms of interests and (you\u2019ll see why) behavior.\n\nSo this has been going for a huge while, but it hasn\u2019t been an issue until recently. So let\u2019s skip to recent stuff. \nTwo weeks ago we had a student trip to Barcelona (we\u2019re in the same class of the same Art school, and no, we didn\u2019t meet there). Everything was cool, and we were at the airport ready to depart. \nSuddenly I hear her laugh, I look at her and I see a horrible picture of me she just took without me noticing. I decide to not be a bitch about it and not ask her to delete it and I see her sending it to a friend of hers. I immediately stop playing it fine and ask her why she\u2019d do that without asking. She gets mad and says \u00ab\u00a0You do it all the time why would I not do it\u00a0\u00bb\n\nNow I don\u2019t have any proof of what I\u2019m about to say but I\u2019m asking you to trust me. I hate when people do that. And I think it\u2019s common sense to not do it to other people then. I assure you I never sent any of this kind of picture of her to anyone without asking her. And even if I did, everytime I ask she says \u00ab\u00a0of course, I don\u2019t care, why do you even ask\u00a0\u00bb.\nI don\u2019t know about you, but to me this is clearly just a way of not getting in trouble by accusing me of something I can\u2019t prove wrong.\n\nNow let\u2019s skip to a week later, this comes up in the conversation. (Because I\u2019m still salty about it) and she goes \u00ab\u00a0come on, I didn\u2019t send any since then, I didn\u2019t even show any\u00a0\u00bb. To which I immediately responded \u00ab\u00a0because usually you show them ?\u00a0\u00bb\nThat\u2019s me discovering not only she\u2019s been sending them, but also showing them when I\u2019m not around, just by going through her pictures and stopping by them. I stopped talking to try and not make a scene and texted her to delete all of the ugly pictures she had. Which she apparently did, but I\u2019m planning on asking her if I can verify that because I\u2019m really lacking trust at this point. \n\nNow let\u2019s skip again to last weekend. We were at her house to sleepover with her new boyfriend and her best friend (I call her her best friend even tho she insists on telling me I am her best friend but that\u2019s another story that I honestly don\u2019t care about)\nI saw her best friend changing clothes, and me being the lesbian I am, I found her rather good looking. Not anything pervert or something, but platonically and frankly, she\u2019s very good looking. I later told this to my friend and asked her to not tell her. \nNow I don\u2019t mind her bff knowing about this at all, but I didn\u2019t want her to talk about it behind my back. If someone\u2019s gonna say it, then it\u2019s me. \n\nAnd yesterday, I found that that she told her almost right after that. Like two days later. This time I got really mad. That alone isn\u2019t that bad, but when you think about all that has happened on two weeks and combine it with everything I didn\u2019t mentioned here that happened over the years, I\u2019m starting to feel like I just can\u2019t trust her with anything now.\n\nI just don\u2019t know how to handle this. I want to tell her to delete every picture of me she has, and never mention my name to anyone when I\u2019m not around, but that\u2019s not how a friendship works. We need trust. But right now I\u2019m in a situation where I cannot give her any anymore. I\u2019ve been talking about it to her best friend who is very comprehensive (and we\u2019re friends too) but I really don\u2019t know if it\u2019s actually gonna help. \nI\u2019m scared of telling her just about anything, and I don\u2019t even want to meet her friends because I know they have all seen the worst pics of me and know about all my personal stories. (She also like to tell them when I have a crush on someone, or when I do anything interesting, but it\u2019s never really in a positive way).\n\nThe thing is she\u2019s not just a bitch that doesn\u2019t care about me, she just seems to not understand that it bothers me deeply, and why I get mad at her. She thinks all of it is normal and part of a friendship.\nAnd maybe it is to her, but she needs to understand that it\u2019s not the same to me. I tried to talk to her about it so many times, and it never worked. I\u2019m out of ideas, I need help\n\nEDIT : TLDR : the title is enough, but the rest really helps with context and understanding how much of an issue it is. Spoiler alert : it\u2019s straight up disrespectful and she just doesn\u2019t understand why", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I understand that her parents won't give her money sometimes but her family has a lot more money than my family could ever have. Her mother is a firefighter and her dad is a professor at a college. My step dad is a mechanic and my mom is on disability because of a brain disability. Even with this money difference i always give the most and I don't have to ask what she wants for a gift. I listen to whenever she talks about things she wants and take a mental note. My birthday is close to Christmas it's 20 or so days before, she always combines the gifts. Which i'm fine with, but she only got me a pair of socks, slippers and a Christmas ornament. When it came to her Christmas i got her a 70 dollar giant stuffed animal dog. But she wanted this monkey one that I looked everywhere for but I could not find one. But it turns out her mom already got here one. Which was fine because I got her the dog one but whenever I come over, the dog one was in the basement and the monkey was in her room. It hurt a little, but it's not a size problem because her room is twice the size of mine. She plays softball and I try my best to go to her games. During the school year she would give me rides home, which I greatly appreciated. I lived six blocks away from the school. My parents loved her at first but once she canceled on two movies which wasted my parents money they grew a little cold towards her. She promised to go to Avengers Endgame with me opening night. My parents get tickets 4 months before the movie so I had to ask her and make sure she was going for sure. And she swore up and down that she was going to go so we could experience all the heartache together. My parents were extra cautious when they bought the tickets because she canceled another movie the morning of going before. So it was the week of the movie and she starts saying how she was going to see it again a day after we see it because it's her brothers birthday party and she offered if I wanted to go. I said yes but asked if she still was going with me she said that she did not want to because she's already going. That honestly hurt but I told her I'm still going opening night but I'm inviting someone else. She got mad and said fine, and the only reason I'm going to her brothers birthday party is because her brother did not invite enough people so they needed a certain amount to go. Whenever we go out to eat i'm always the one paying, because I want to do something with her.  But whenever she gets money she goes and gets food from the dollar store. Which is completely fine because we usually go together and I get us a bunch of food, but it would be nice if she would take me with just for fun. During the first year of high school I bought her a lot of these one drinks with my mothers money because she spent all of hers already so I felt bad and got her some. Don't get me wrong me and this friend talk and have a lot of \"therapy sessions\" together and get into really deep topics. She's someone I can tell anything to. But whenever she is in a time of need i always swoop down and help her. I wish she would do the same to me. I really do love this friend we know how to make each other laugh and we have had a lot of good times together. But I'm really just wondering if she is truly a good friend or not. I don't want to drop her, I just want to adapt and spend less money. So, is she a good friend to have around?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

That was fine because she wanted it too, but since we were sleeping at a friend's house and we were in the same room they started low key hooking up in front of me (they were both drunk). I know it's not the most chill thing to do but I asked them if they could stop because I wanted to go to bed. The girl was really rude to me and so was my guy friend. So then, I just said I would move to a different room but I didn't appreciate how they gave me attitude and were just doing that stuff in the open public. \n\nSo him and this girl continue talking right and they're kinda a thing. Cool, whatever. One night we were all hanging out again with our other group of friends except this time he got blackout drunk and hooked up with another girl in the same room we were all staying in. We all got pretty annoyed with him. At this point, I didn't really know how serious him and this other girl actually were but I was pretty pissed at my friend's behaviour and his evident lack of boundaries so I called my other close friend and vented about it to him. Only problem: this friend is like best friends with the girl. He was immediately worried about him hooking up with someone else and told the girl even though I told him to wait and that they should work it out between themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen my friend got SO mad at me for gossiping. Under normal circumstances, I would agree that this is gossiping but I felt like he was almost taking out all of his anger at his own mistakes on me. He dropped everything to help fix things with his girlfriend and didn't even take a moment to consider how he offended me. Mind you he just met this girl and slept with her twice and we've been friends a year. I tried talking to him about it, apologized for gossiping but he really feels like my gossiping is worse than what he did. I'm upset because I feel like he was being a douchebag and got no consequences for what he did (the original girl took him back even after he cheated).

I still believe in such a person. \n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers). \n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values). \n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

I'm new to reddit, and my thoughts tend to get jumbled around, so some of this might be a bit disorganized.\n\nSo, I have a friend who we will call C. And to really get perspective on the issues I'm having, a bit of background. I've always had trouble in school- not because I'm a bad kid (the opposite, really- I'm an anxiety riddled mess who is easily intimidated, so trouble seems a nightmare to me). I moved from one side of the country to the other- and then back. My grades always struggled, and I went through a lot of emotional neglect at home- parents are divorced, and I had issues living with either parent. So. I met C in my... Freshman year? Sophomore? One of the two- school is a blur because how often I switched. This was my last year in a \"real\" high school- from then on I would be in alternative schools because how bad my anxiety and depression hit me and I couldn't function in normal schools (plus bully issues, but that's another story). \n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is, I met C at a fairly rough time in my teen years (I'm 22 now). I was being bullied ruthlessly, dealing with issues at home, and was a time I had no friends- and hadn't had friends in a while. C and I got along talking about video games and anime (I was sorta leaving my anime phase at that time, but it was still something we could bond over). She was really sweet, and helped me out a lot- especially the times I got to escape home and go stay at her place. But her place was still a bit... difficult to deal with, I suppose? Her mom intimidates me easily, and her dad is rarely home- I can tell that she has issues because of it, but that's another thing to discuss later, maybe. The big thing that got to me about their home- they are hoarders. Probably not as bad as the extreme cases you see on TV, but still bad. They keep every plastic cup/bowl/straw that can be put in a dishwasher without being destroyed. Her mom comes home with a trunk load of things from work every week (retail). But what struck me most was C's room. It was piled on one wall entirely with old clothes- clothes that belonged to her dead grandmother. It sorta breaks my heart, because I know it's clearly an emotional/mental thing that is probably causing it, but she refuses to get rid of all her grandmothers' clothes because she wants to be close to her. But she doesn't understand just how unhealthy it is. Perhaps I stepped out of line, but at some point I couldn't stand the clutter any longer and offered/tried to fold the mountains of laundry. I got through maybe 1/12th of it, and nothing improved and there was just nothing that could be done. Despite all this though, I would have gladly spent time there instead of home, at the time.\n\nNow see, here's the thing about C. She is a nice girl. Most the time. But she always has something to say. Always has to be the center of attention. If you tell a story about your life, she has to interrupt and say \"Oh, I have a story like that too- but this and this happened!\" Sometimes that might be alright- I myself am ADD and I do that at times, say something before I forget it. But she doesn't do it for those reasons. She does it to be the center of attention- and most the stories she say are just that- stories, things she's clearly made up on the spot to seem interesting- things that are almost cringe-worthy in how fake they are and how they highlight her to be a saint. It's likely my own fault for having tolerated it, but I would just sit and listen and try not to question- because good lord. If you question it- she plays the guilt card. \"I'm sorry I have such stupid stories, I just suck and you hate me.\" No, girl. I just don't see the point in you lying to seem interesting. You don't need to do that- I'm already your friend. Most the time I can sorta tolerate it, until it happens around other people- ei, my parents or other family. She will ramble on and on, she has a very loud voice, and while I am used to it and tolerate it- my parents can't stand it. My mom doesn't like being around her much. My dad is a bit more tolerant, but always comments when she's gone that she makes up stories and doesn't ever stop talking and it's not normal. \n\nC also has moods. As stated above, she doesn't take being called out or questioned very well at all. She turns it into a guilt thing. Guilt is her biggest tool. All the time. My most frustrating situation with it was at an anime con. Almost two years ago, I started dating a mutual friend who I'll call L- who is also a girl (I'm lesbian). Now, C has claimed to be a supporter for LGBT+. And I do believe she has the best of intentions- but doesn't realize how she can sometimes be homophobic. When I first discussed with C and another friend that I might ask L out, one friend was all happy about it! But C? She caused a scene. She started crying. \n\n\"If you start dating, I'll be a 3rd wheel all the time! I don't know how to deal with friends who are dating, especially two girls!\" The other friend and I were just speechless. But I asked L out anyways, because C having a hissy-fit wasn't going to stop me. Now, skip ahead to the anime con. C and I had to share a room, since her family paid for the room- L and another friend (who we'll call M) shared another room. C and L don't get along, so C avoids her like the plague. Which means she follows L and I around the con like a puppy. We literally cannot get away from her at any point. And trying to tell her we wanted to hang out alone, turned into another fit of \"You're gonna 3rd wheel me like I knew you would, woe is me\". L and I wanted at least a bit of alone time, to catch up and hang out without C always interrupting. I felt bad for doing it, but at some point L and I managed to just rush away from C while she was busy. It was almost like we had to run and hide to get some alone chill time. And when C eventually stormed down the hall we escaped to, we felt like kids who had been caught doing something bad- just for hanging out with each other, while we were dating, without her for maybe 10 minutes. And she made some comments again about us dating that just rubbed us the wrong way. We decided later that we would have a chat with her about it at the room.\n\nSo, later we are in C and I's room. L and I tried to gently and carefully let her know that we didn't like the snide comments she made about us dating. How it really wasn't her business if we dated or not, that it really didn't effect her- she just made it about herself for no reason. Does she apologize or own up to it? Not at all. She makes excuses. \"I've been emotional cuz my uncle is in trouble for something! (An obvious lie). This trip has just been overwhelming for me! (Maybe acceptable). I'm just not used to having friends who are girls date! (Again, none of her concern).\" In the end, L and I decided to leave it be- we were too tired to argue anymore, and decided if it continued any longer, we might just have to cut off the friendship with her. Which just didn't end up happening.\n\nTo be fair, I think she got the hint to stop guilting us about our dating. She even seems accepting of it now that it's been almost 2 years. But there are still so many things she does that are toxic and not cool. I keep thinking I should drop her as a friend- but at the same time, she's been there for me at the most difficult times of my life- including now. At the moment, I live with my mom- and my mom is the more harsh parent. We live 3 hours away from any other family or my friends (including C). Normally I would turn to L in these times- but she is in University at the moment, and rather busy- so I try not to add too much to her already busy schedule, and give her space. So really the only friend I chat with lately, the only outside contact besides the strained relationship with my mom, is Skyping with C. It's almost a daily occurrence. While she still has so many toxic traits, I do feel like she's getting better- but is she really? Sometimes I can't tell, because she could switch moods at any moment. Depending on her mood a certain week, she could go right back to being toxic. But at the moment, she's the only \"reliable\" or more accurately \"available at the moment\" person I can reach out to when I'm stressed (which is often). I just don't know what to do. It is obvious to me that she has issues- things she probably needs professional help for, but unfortunately I highly doubt she ever will. I do feel bad for her because she clearly needs help- but I can't provide it, and it's not my job to do so. Do I keep it up and hope that she really is improving? Do I try to talk to her about it? I'm afraid to do so, since the last time she was confronted about her attitude, it got nowhere- perhaps we went about it the wrong way? Or is she just someone I need to let go of?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Also if I don't reply or you think I'm ignoring you, I'm honestly not.\n\nI find talking about it very difficult and I'm not very open about my feelings. I often put on a brave face and think there's much worse off people than me. Writing that was itself a struggle.\n\nIt must seem I'm full of neuroses but I hope that I've a lot to offer a friendship and try not to let any of that define what I do. \n\nI feel my life isn\u2019t where I wanted it to be or that it could have been and am looking to get passed everything and achieve what I want.

I don't know how to handle this situation and it's been affecting me a lot.", "author": "blisteringbarnacles_", "self_text": "This is a long post so I apologise beforehand. There isn't an easy way to TLDR this without losing context, so I haven't.\n\nTo begin with, we've been best friends for 7 years now. We had been VERY close to the point that others used to think that we were dating (we weren't and she has had the same boyfriend since before we became friends). I am kinda introverted in general so having a close friend like her meant a HUGE deal for me. In the recent past, we went to different schools and live pretty far from each other now. But we've always kept in touch and text each other almost everyday. A year or so after she started school, she became friends with a guy who ended up having feelings for her. She didn't reciprocate but she continued being friends with him and they became very close friends. The guys tried again and again to date her but I don't know what ultimately happened between them because she never talked to me about it. This strained her own relationship with her BF (same guy from before we became friends). She then told me that although she never accepted the other guy's advances, she did get close to him more than she should have amd that affected her own relationship. I tried my best to help her out to sort things and it seemed like it was okay. In the past year or two, she started to seem very detached from me and stopped being the close friend she had been to me. She'd be lying to me on trivial matters and be very secretive so it struck me on the back of my mind if she actually started dating that guy. we'd have multiple conversations regarding this fact and every time she'd say that I'm thinking wrong and I should trust her more. So much so that I started hating myself for not trusting her. I actually trust her the most but her actions would always make me think otherwise at least in this matter. One of those days, she'd been not replying to my texts for days and that's very unlinke her so I was worried and so I logged in her phone account to see where she was (I know it's a gross violation of trust and privacy but I was actually really worried for her) and I saw that she was at that guy's place and she remained there the whole night. When she finally replied to my text, she lied amd said she was at her cousin's place. And I'm not proud of this but I periodically kept tabs on her and she had been spending nights at the guy's place very regularly. I broached the question to her again if she's dating him without giving away that I knew she was spending nights at his place and she vehemently denied it. We would end up having fights on this over and over again and every time she'd deny it. She'd have photos on her phone with the guy on trips and then she'd come back and say she went with friends. Now I totally understand that it's her choice to be with whomever she wants to be. And I'm happy with it as long as she's happy. But in the process she stopped being the good friend she had been. I mysef have had two break ups during the time we've been friends and both were really serious relationships. I was a wreck both times and the first time she alone got me through it. The second time was a year ago and she didn't even talk or text me after she heard that my relationship had ended. Someone who I needed the most at that time was never there. Now she's supposed to be on an internship in another state and I saw on her iCloud that the guy went there with her. This is what affects me the most. I'm not jealous that she's giving her attention to someone else, but the constant lying is so disheartening. All I ever expected was a little honesty. My mental health has been really bad after my last break up and I hoped she'd be there for me but she hasn't really been. Her lies seem like a bigger betrayal to me amd I've been depressed for a long time. I don't know how to handle thid situation. I badly want to bring this up to her and have some answers but don't know how. I'm scared that I'll lose whatever's left of our friendship if I call her bluff and disclose everything. I REALLY cherish out friendship. But then again all these thoughts are driving me insane and affecting my work and life in general. I haven't been truly happy in a LONG time and I want to be normal again. Normally in such situations I would talk to her for advice but obviously with this situation I can't. Any thoughts or comments or suggestions would be gladly appreciated. Even if you just read it till the end, thank you for taking the time for it.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We used to talk everyday after school and sometimes we\u2019d talk until the morning. We used to be so close and she\u2019d always give me surprise visits so much that I pretty much anticipated that everyday she\u2019d be at my gate calling for me. She\u2019d initially come to say hi until we started talking. It kicked off so perfectly. I had nobody and I was a lonely guy and along comes the literal most beautiful girl I met to keep me company. So of course I had doubts of her intentions. We got close really fast and I got her to open up to me too and she showed me things that her parents didn\u2019t know. 2 out of the 5 school days of the week is me and her walking across the neighborhood to a park to talk and talk until the sun went down. I\u2019d always tell her that I loved her so much because I never had a friend like this. Whenever it was late and she was sad, I\u2019d send her paragraphs to cheer her up. My parents caught me talking to her about things and they didn\u2019t want me talking to her. My mum got so mad that she broke my phone. We still talked on Twitter in secret. \nAfter december, things started going downhill. She started distancing herself because the situation we were in was very similar to another friendship she had and she didn\u2019t want to be hurt. I told her that I\u2019d never want to go away from her. So we talked about it and I tried to maintain. I got bummed out because she didn\u2019t visit like she used to. We would meet every saturday at church to hang out afterwards but I was used to waiting at the gate. I started getting really sad for personal reasons. So I started overthinking. I started to develop anxiety and I hated being with her. Her presence made me think about so many things. Why did she make me a friend? I\u2019m a pathetic loser. I started thinking that everything was a joke. She stopped taking me seriously. It went to the point that I had a breakdown in front of all her friends. After that happened I started to believe all her friends saw me as a freak and that she was making me some sort of joke. Valentines hit and we wrote each other letters and I sent her a pink stuffed dinosaur. I read her letters and hugged her because it was the nicest thing someone did for me. After that we grew distant and we couldn\u2019t recover. I tried hard. I got angry when she was unintentionally ignoring me. So I grew a hatred for her. I also got sad when she found someone because we said many times to each other \u201cYeah go find someone and leave me\u201d and I feared that. After church she said that it\u2019ll never be the same again and I talked out my hate for her. \nWe\u2019re not really friends, but it\u2019d suck to lose the person who had the most perfect timing.\n\n(Sorry for the story, I needed to vent a bit)\n\nFrom crying in her arms to crying alone \nHow do we fix this boys?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Lately though I feel that she's been pushing me away? And I feel that I get annoyed by her so so easily.   \n\n\nFor example, right now I had commended on a facebook post of her and she didn't reply, but at the same time she wrote in the big group chat we are in? She talks with another girl from her work almost everyday and they go out and do stuff. She pretty regularly calls her old best friend on the phone while she rarely ever calls me or texts me. Right now she's going through an exam which is why I believe maybe she's not texting me as often but everytime we meet she always is on her phone or calls one of those two other girls.   \n\n\nRecently I got a dream job, like honestly a dream job for me, but I don't have much free time now. I work Monday-Friday and I come home around 8pm, tired, so I don't really want to go out. So I understand that she's going out with other people, but it kind of bothers me and I feel bad that it bothers me.   \n\n\nWe saw eachother a few days ago and she noticed my short skirt, she started saying things like 'isn't this too short?', ' don't you know that when you have a big butt the skirt lifts up?' and so on, I reacted pretty offended and she immediately got upset. The day before that she wore really really short shorts (a lot shorter than my skirt) but I didn't tell her anything because I know she likes those shorts?   \n\n\nAlso, my bff and cousin live together, and on Friday when I went at their place to help my cousin with a test for a job interview (for the same company I work for) , I politely asked my bff if she can just go to the other room because the test was in english and my cousin gets nervous when speaking english. While my bff thinks she's the best and for every small mistake you make, she corrects you and tries to make herself sound like she's a native speaker. So anyways she went away, and about 40 minutes later when my cousin was doing the hardest part of the test (in which they tell you a story in english and you have to remember as much as possible and repeat it) my bff walks in the room and I, with hand signs, tell her like 'go away', 'no ' and so on but she just looks at me weird and comes inside the room. My cousin got distracted and failed that part of her test.... Later when I asked her why did she come in when I told her go away she said ' how could I know that you were telling me to go away?'   \n\n\nI don't know what's going on. I don't know how to feel.

I don't mind if you're a novice level artist, or even advanced and nearly there - as long as you're dedicated to putting in multiple hours of practice every single day to improve, and know how to occasionally chill.

She also only cares about herself and is on her phone ALL the time. Those are the main friends, then comes alex who is in our group but not as close, now she is really fun and interesting but she cares only about herself, even though i really like her one of the things i value the most in friendship is being a good friend and she is not.\nThen there is the other friend (emma) who was my best friend when we were younger but now we kind of drifted apart and we have no converstion topic, she also is very fake and doesn't hang out with us as often.\n\nThe thing is that lily loves sarah really much, i'd say that she consideres us both her best friends.

Rock, pop, world, electronic, heavy metal, country, rap, folk music. I'm open to any genre and any time period. I would never dismiss a song based solely on genre or the fact that it is too old or too new. \n\nThat being said, obviously I have favorite genres, and I don't like every song I've ever heard. Some of my favorite genres are electro pop, new wave, and alternative. \n\nSo if anyone out there is obsessed with music and interested in learning new stuff with me, just send me a chat on here, and we can talk more. :)\n\nOnly requirements I have are being comfortable with just texting predominantly and also for the person to be around 25 years or older.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We\u2019ve been \u201cbest friends\u201d since about October or so. \n\nThis has a little more context than a wedding shower...\n\nPart 1:  The Canoe Trip\n\nMy mom had a bit of a mental breakdown in May. What\u2019s important to know was it was extremely traumatic, and it started with her being worried about a canoe trip I was going on with my best friend Memorial day weekend. \n\nAfter it was all over, my dad tells me and my brother my mom basically disassociated and that I need to cancel my trip. He says he\u2019s so sorry, he\u2019ll make it up to me, I just need to trust him. So I do. \n\nThis happened on a Wednesday night, the trip was on Saturday. I called up my friend immediately after my dad told me, cried to her, told her everything, and then told her I couldn\u2019t make it. She was pretty upset. She told me that I shouldn\u2019t be listening to what my mom wants if everyone agrees she\u2019s not in her right mind. I told her it was just so my mom didn\u2019t have any stress. \n\nFriday my parents had just left for a week long trip and there weren\u2019t any goodbyes. I was pretty upset. Best friend calls me that night was pretty upset with me. She told me she was mad I never updated her, and she was mad that I was actually following through with missing the trip. She invited me to come over and I did.\n\nShe and our mutual friend thought I should go so I ended up texting my dad and begging him. When she saw how sad and stressed my dad was, she said forget it. She didn\u2019t want to be a burden. I love my dad and don\u2019t want to worry him, so I decided to not go. She and my friend and I all got plastered that night and had a really good time.  \n\nPart 2: Aladdin\n\nSo this was the next Tuesday. We talked about going to see the new Aladdin movie because the theatre charges half price on Tuesdays. I make plans with her. The night before, my boyfriend reminds me about plans with him and his friend. I made them before the altercation with my mom, which is probably why I forgot. It was late, so I texted her in the morning. Conversation goes like this.\n\nHer: Aladdin?\n\nMe: I texted your phone. I fucked up. \n\nHer: ...which was?\n\nMe: I promised to hang out with my boyfriend and our friend tonight and forgot about it.\n\nHer: ...oh.\n\nMe: I\u2019m really really really sorry.\n\nHer: oh\n\nMe: I think our friend just wants to go see a different movie if you guys want to tag along too.\n\nHer: No thanks\n\nMe: I\u2019m sorry.. I\u2019ll make it up to you\n\nHer: No thanks\n\nSo I give her space, and text her the next day.\n\nMe: Hey\n\nHer: What?\n\nMe: I\u2019m just trying to say hi...\n\nHer: Okay\n\nMe:...why are you acting like this? I fucked up, I forgot I already made plans. You would want anyone to do the same for you.\n\nHer: I\u2019m just tired of the \u201cI\u2019ll make it up shit\u201d so I just don\u2019t really wanna hear it.\n\nMe: I\u2019m really trying here...\n\nHer: Seems one sided as fuck. I\u2019m not even mad. Just tired of trying to be a good friend and you not even acting like it\u2019s important.\n\nMe: Shit falls through. I was in a tough spot and hoped you would understand. You\u2019ve ditched me before, at 10pm. After I bought food and cleaned and planned for people to come stay the night.\n\nHer: I HAD ALCOHOL AND THERE WAS A ROADBLOCK. And I was depressed those days.\n\nMe: Ok. But I didn\u2019t make a big deal. Because I figured you were depressed. But it did hurt me, and I didn\u2019t treat you like this.\n\nHer: Because I don\u2019t tell you everything I do.\n\nMe: ?\n\nHer: Mainly because you have shit and I don\u2019t want to add onto it.\n\nMe: Well that\u2019s not fair to you or me.. because if you\u2019re not letting me in how am I supposed to help.. \n\nHer: I don\u2019t want to discuss this.\n\nShe later texted me like everything was fine and I just played along and pretended it didn\u2019t happen. I invited her to go see Aladdin with me twice after that and offered to pay for the tickets entirely and she refused twice so I figured I should just let it go.\n\nPart 3: The Wedding Shower\n\nSo for filler, when my parents came back from their trip, four of our family members died. None super close (besides one) but I briefly mentioned it to my best friend. Also, my doctor increased the dose of one of my medications which is giving me insomnia, like 3-5 hours of sleep at night insomnia. She is out of office for vacation so I haven\u2019t gotten it fixed yet. She\u2019s asked me to hang out when I was catching up on sleep with naps and declined. I asked her to hang out and she declined. We hung out the day after that. We hung out one night until 3am, and then last Friday... she told me she would text me when she came back to town to hang out and she didn\u2019t. I never said anything because why would I, something probably came up. I trust her.\n\nShe texts the bridesmaids group chat Thursday and says \u201cI\u2019m thinking of having my wedding shower on July 13th so don\u2019t make any plans for that day. Or at least try not to, that sounded very bridezilla of me lol.\u201d And we all say \u201cok\u201d\n\nREWIND\n\nMy WONDERFUL gamer boyfriend of 4 years now is planning to meet his online pals for the first time in the 7 years he\u2019s known them. He doesn\u2019t have many in person friends, but he does have a bunch of online friends. They\u2019ve gone through all kinds of shit together. His friend is throwing a little weekend birthday party in Missouri so it\u2019s pretty even on traveling distance for everyone. They\u2019ve had this date set for a while, and he wants me to come meet them. So of course, I want to go.\n\nHe reminds me yesterday what day it is, I\u2019ve just been thinking \u201cit\u2019s some weekend in July\u201d, but I immediately realize... it\u2019s the weekend of the 13th.\n\nSo I\u2019m talking it over with him, he says if it\u2019s too big of an issue he thinks I should go to the shower and I agree. So I go to text my friend about it.\n\nMe: Hey, I forgot BF  planned something for the 13th.. He\u2019s meeting a bunch of his online friends for one of their 21st birthday parties and wants me to come meet them too\n\nHer: why\n\nMe: Why what?\n\nHer: when do you have to meet them?\n\nMe: I think we\u2019re leaving on the 12th and coming home that Sunday.\n\nHer: Wow. Okay.\n\nSo I tell my mans how she\u2019s reacting and it seems like she\u2019s set on the 13th. He\u2019s upset, but understands I need to be there for my friend\u2019s wedding shower. So I text her.\n\nMe: Nevermind. I\u2019m cancelling with him. Sorry I\u2019m a forgetful bitch.\n\nHer: Forget it. You were gonna go. I don\u2019t care if you come to the shower now.\n\nMe: Well I was trying to see if you were even set on that date still... or if someone else had a conflict and you were gonna be like \u201coh I\u2019ll just move it to another weekend\u201d\n\nHer: I said it was that day. I don\u2019t care what you do. Why would I change the date... for your benefit?\n\nMe: I said if other people had conflict, not just me. And you said you were thinking of the 13th.\n\nHer: Forget it. Even if I couldn\u2019t change it you were gonna go with him, that hurts my feelings. (Which is not true.. because I just canceled plans with him) Like I\u2019m having ONE wedding, one. And I wanted you to be a part of this shit and you act like I\u2019m supposed to be the one texting you. I help everyone all the goddamned time. Why can\u2019t someone help me for once. No one has asked me once if I need help with anything. So for you saying that, or anything for the thousandth time. Fuck you for that.\n\nMe: It\u2019s not like I made new plans after you told me.. he made them a month ago and just brought it back up and I immediately texted you, and cancelled. \n\nHer: Forget it\n\nMe: I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re under a lot of stress but I don\u2019t know how to help unless you ask for it...\n\nHer: Just forget it. Leave me alone.\n\nMe: Just talk to me\n\nHer: Rather not.\n\nAnd THAT is where the story ends. Let me tell you what I think I know.\n\nI know that I\u2019m a forgetful bitch. I should be more responsible. But this shit happens to me all the time! College kids are unreliable, I just expect plans to fall through half the time now because they do! I love her and want to be friends with her but not if I\u2019m going to get attacked whenever I cancel plans. It feels like if I don\u2019t drop everything for her I\u2019m a bitch and I really beat myself up about it. But I know for a fact if I were in her position I wouldn\u2019t react like that, about any of it. I\u2019d just let it go and say \u201canother time\u201d.\n\nAs far as the wedding shower, I feel like it\u2019s important for me to be reliable. Which I wasn\u2019t. But it\u2019s not like I made plans after the fact, I already promised to go with my boyfriend. And then, I did drop everything then and there and that wasn\u2019t good enough either. I know I should text her, but I really don\u2019t want to kiss ass and say how sorry I am anymore because it\u2019s getting old. What do you guys think I should do?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

During the course of this time we got to spend a lot of time together and got to talk a lot. \nHe\u2019s a really shy guy but lately I\u2019ve been noticing that he\u2019s getting comfortable around me and isn\u2019t as nervous as he would normally be. Because he\u2019s shy I always initiate the our greets and goodbyes but now he does it first and he even goes in for a hug. \nHowever, At the reception each couple would be called in hall by the host, while we waited for that to happen we were talking. There was a moment where we got really close because he was looking at my rose bouquets and he was touching the petals. He pointed out how they were getting wrinkles and then I look at his boutonni\u00e8res and I went to fix it for him and he teased me about being careful and not stabbing him with the pin. After we\u2019re called the bridesmaids are standing in a line to the right and bridegrooms are standing parallel to them on the left. We had to lift our hands in an angle so the bride and the groom could cross under. My arm was stretched out in the air and I also had my bouquet in that hand, he actually put his hand around mine and held it there. When we went to our seats he sat next to me, when we were called to go eat which was buffet style my dress got caught to the table cloth and he waited for me. When we got to the buffet I hand him a plate and says for me to go first. Then he served me even when I was going to try to serve myself. Then there was an issue with my ride home. By this time I had said my goodbyes and after like half an hour I walk back in he is on the dance floor and his eyes lock on mine but he doesn\u2019t move until the song is finished. He then says \u201cwhat happened? I thought you left?\u201d And I was like \u201cit\u2019s a long story\u201d because I was a little anxious and stressed out. He laughed and then I walked away and he comes back and asks me if I have a ride and has this concerned look on his face. And after I said yes he was like \u201c okay good but what happened ?\u201d \u2014he was praying for the details and of course I told him. \nAfter it all I\u2019m sitting eating dessert when I see that him and his family are getting ready to leave. I\u2019m focused on my cake and my back is facing the exit. When I turn around again, I realized his family had left but he still hadn't left and he\u2019s looking for someone. That\u2019s when he waves until he catches my attention and smiles at me. Then he walks right out the door. \nI know this is a lot and I might be reading into this too much.

A few months ago, I confessed to her because she was one of my best friends. She was a bit stupid and she seriously had no idea I liked her. It was SO obvious but that's another story. She got super freaked out and we had a fight but we fight literally all the time so that's normal. I hate fighting with her but I'd never leave the friendship because I'm obsessed with her and I love her. \n\nIt's been a little tense at times since then when she's heard me discussing her with other people, because she's not quite as naive about that now. But for the most part, things were fine, normal.\n\nBut we had a massive fight two weeks ago, and the weekend before last she said she wanted nothing to do with me anymore and she didn't want to be my friend anymore.\n\nWe are in the same class and we sit with a mutual friend, and with her she was normal again, and I thought she was going to be my friend again. But when that friend was away, she was really rude and she wouldn't speak to me or even look at me. \n\nI'm really upset but I know that we need space, and I don't need her drama in my life. I want to give us some space but I just want us not to be good friends again straight away, but just normal to each other. \n\nHow do I get her to be my friend again?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Aren't jokes supposed to be funny? they're not even funny, they're just mean, she has zero care for the way they make me feel and she spouts off a bunch of nonsense. \n\nThe things she has said have made me cry and made me feel terrible about myself. I live in an abusive household, all through my childhood I've been hit by my father, now that I'm old, it's not physical abuse but emotional abuse. I'm gay and an atheist, my parents are extremely religious and will kill me or disown me if they find out and I have to live a double life because of it. As a result, I have a plethora of issues. My friend however, refuses to acknowledge that I have to go through difficult things, she refuses to acknowledge that I have it bad too, she claims that I have nothing to complain about since my dad makes good money. She said that my problems aren't the worst thing in the world and therefore I shouldn't complain about it( which is absolute bullocks especially when she cries about how her dad won't let her wear shorts outside which also, according to her, not the worst thing in the world so why is she complaining?).\n\nShe is also a hypocrite, she always says things which she herself will never follow and openly claim that she is a hypocrite. One time when my dad yelled at me about my mannerisms, I told her and she told me that I could've CHOSEN not to be affected by what he said but she herself cries about things like her dad commenting on her hair. \n\nI have been severely depressed and anxious and she says that I don't have anxiety because she's had it and she knows what it's like EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED BY A LICENSED THERAPIST she will refuse the fact as if she knows every single thing about me, she always acts like she knows exactly how I function and how I am. She will disregard my feelings but when I even make a single mistake and say something offhanded she gets super angry and pissed, when I'm \"joking\" she gets extremely offended.\n\nI feel drained and tired and sad after every single conversation with her, she makes me feel like I'm a piece of trash unworthy of anything, I can't even feel like I can attempt to learn something without her saying something about how dumb I am and can never do it.\n\nI don't wanna end my friendship with her because she is the type of person to talk to everyone else about me, to make herself the victim and make it seem like I was the villain. That's why I suffer in silence, I can't tell her anything because any attempt at a normal conversation ends with her getting angry and offended and never leads to anything productive. She'll just spit out the same stance she had in the first place.\n\nI don't know what to do or how to get myself out of this predicament. I hate her, I don't like saying that now but I don't know how else to describe how I feel.\nShe makes me wanna slit my wrists, it is a horrible feeling.\n\nWhat do I do?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Soon we were spending lots of time together I got to know her family quite well and was often invited to family functions. She would constantly tell me how I was her best friend and we would be friends for years to come, I have made such a difference in her life,  blah blah blah blah.  Two months ago she was promoted to be my boss and about the same time she met a guy who she was instantly in \"love\" with. The person I thought she was completely changed. Now she constantly lies to me, she insisted that I spend time with her boyfriend and then allowed him to be really nasty to me even though I had never met him before, and turns out she had lied to him about me.  The things she has done in the two months she's dating him makes me want to erase her from my life.  overnight I went from the best friend she can't live without (she told me that) to the person she despises and she goes out of her way to lie to me and do mean things and back stab me at work - and she is my boss!  I tried talking to her about it and as a result she told everyone at work that she can't say anything to me or my feelings are hurt and she blames me for her boyfriends ugliness (first time i met him, he told me, I don't really care about liking you).\n\nThe truth is I want nothing to do with her and I would completely block her number and forget she existed but the problem is I work with her.  two questions, 1. Do I even bother to try to save this friendship, if so, how? Just step back until her and this guy break up? Or what do I do? Any relationship between myself and her boyfriend can never be repaired after the situation she put us both in and she told me he told her, he shouldn't even bother with someone like me; 2. how do I manage the work situation? I can't avoid her because it's a smaller office and she's one of the people I have to report to.  I want nothing to do with her after the way she has treated me the last two months and it's  evil stuff - physically attacking me, calling me names, etc.  she's lived here for 10 years and doesn't have any close friends - A warning sign I should've paid attention to, but now I'm stuck in this awful situation because when I try to fade away I will have trouble at work because for some reason she gets ugly when I don't have the amount of contact as before, but if I have contact, she spends it berating me and using it to spread more work gossip. i am stuck in her path of ugliness. I really don't know what to do and quitting my job isn't an option right now.  i'm sick to my stomach about this situation as i cant distance myself. how do I manage her when I have zero power", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Looking for a friendship; someone I can talk to regularly about whatever. And maybe even a group of people if it makes sense, though I surmise that isn't likely. Long post incoming, so get ready.\n\nI moved to a small town in Texas a little under a year ago. I live with my girlfriend and my [cat](https://imgur.com/a/Pmdxe83) in a town northeast of Dallas. We moved here about a year ago, and it's a bit different from Chicago. There's a lot less to do on a daily basis, and sometimes that's a struggle, even if I am more introverted than not. But we just bought a condo this past month, so we're staying here for a couple years until moving back, and making the best of it.\n\nI love to cook, and to really dive into the science behind what makes good food. I'm a big reader of SeriousEats and other food related articles. That's been a major focus for me since coming down here, getting out of the rut of eating out daily and instead focusing on new techniques and more challenging recipes, and I've done a good job of it. I just made an incredible jambalaya yesterday. Plus it comes with the added benefit of helping with weight loss.\n\nI\u2019m a music fanatic. With over 30,000 songs in my iTunes library, I listen to a little bit of a lot of different genres. Currently, iTunes says I have 827 different artists/bands in my collection. Some highlights that I'm really into right now would be The Roots, Prince, Nirvana, Childish Gambino, Carly Rae Jepsen, Elvis Costello, Gnash. My cat is named after David Bowie.\n\nI like to play video games, but it\u2019s not that serious. I\u2019m much more of a casual gamer, at least compared to the competitive nature of other gamers. Most of my gaming recently is playing RTTS - or some offline Diablo 3, Mario Kart or similar with my girlfriend. I have a PS4, Switch, and a huge (and I do mean huge) library of pre-64bit era games. I also have a XBox One; I only have Halo and Doom 3 for the 360 on it, and I probably will only get Battletoads on it going forward.\n\nI used to play D&amp;D 5E until I moved out here, but I haven't found a group to play with, nor have I delved into playing online. I'm super excited to start playing Arkham Horror LCG with my girlfriend once we find the time to sit down and play it without anything else going on.\n\nI\u2019m a pretty big football and baseball fan and could talk your ear off for days talking about the Cubs or how much I hate/love the Jaguars. I also have a bit more than a casual interest in MMA and boxing, though I typically stick to the headline cards for boxing. I'm also All In for AEW's new wresting show when it starts.\n\nLike anybody else, I like movies and TV shows; action, drama and comedy are what I stick to for the most part, but I do love a great horror piece when one comes across my way. Currently, I\u2019m working my way through Big Little Lies, The X-Files, and a rewatch of 30 Rock. I also recently finished up Barry, The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and Netflix's Marvel shows.\n\nI\u2019m very left wing when it comes to politics, and hold very strong liberal viewpoints. I say that not because I need someone to bounce politics off of constantly, but more so because if you\u2019re far on the other side, we\u2019ll probably find we will argue far too much. If you're a Trump fan, or if you're wondering why there isn't a straight pride month, let's not waste each other's time.\n\nI\u2019d like to have someone I can talk to regularly about life, sports, cooking, music, or whatever. Someone in my age range would be ideal. I'm only interested in something 100% platonic with no chance of anything else. Eventually, I would like you to be able to prove you're not a catfish, and I would gladly do the same. I'm active on Discord, if that's the easiest place to talk for anyone, or we can start talking on Reddit and move from there.\n\nHere's a [few photos](https://imgur.com/a/Dg8uqdl) of me if that's something that interests you. And [some more cat photos](https://imgur.com/a/2RWGoS7) if you made it this far.\n\nHope to talk to you soon!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

The other night he came over to complain and cry about his gf and we played video games which is what we do.

The next day I took him home after he crashed on my futon. So a couple of days later my brother and I are trying to do the laundry for my bed. The roll of quarters is no where and my bf\u2019s jacket that my friend borrowed was hanging over a basket next to the jar covering the jar, which is where my friend hung it. My BF and I cleaned my entire apartment for an inspection and the roll was no where to be found. I texted my friend asking if he had seen where I put the roll.... no response about it. He did text me about something unrelated though later the following day so he completely ignored the question. So then today I wrote him and asked if he had accidental taken the quarters... no response. I asked him if he was going to be online later to game and he hasn\u2019t responded but if he does he probably will ignore the question. My bf and I are pretty sure he stole the quarters... because they are literally no where and we think it\u2019s very fishy the coin jar was hidden by the jacket. \n\nHigh probability he took them?

That is the walking without money for over 3months in all of  \n\nKorea. First time, I had just started for fun and actually It was fun to begin with first 1h. \n\nAfter, I can tell how suck it is. So much pain in my body, bleeding my foots, lonely, scare, \n\nhow smell funky myself, too hot and humid weather to walk outside. And my body is too \n\npure to walk. Ye I love to do crazy things.\n\nBut I was learned by this experience.\n\nFirst of all, The world that I\u2019ve seen by slowly walking is truly beautiful.\n\nI was busy everyday every time even innumerable days that never looked sky.\n\nI didn\u2019t have time think about what is beauty. But Slowly walking gave me as gift that how \n\ncreatures are beautiful. Plants, Animals, Wind, Rain, Sky, Day and night, Sun and moon.\n\nEach of them have each beauty. And they were being my friend for me when I feel lonely \n\nand sad, Feel blue.\n\nSecondly, Relationship with people. \n\nI hated people in general. They are selfish, Rude, Treat another like fake.\n\nBut this weird travel makes me like or sometimes love people.\n\nI shared real life with a lot of people that I met while I walked. And they showed me theirs \n\nlife too. A different life that different people live in was noble, Exceeded beautiful.\n\nI cried with someone and I was laugh out loud with someone who I met.\n\nI was into theirs life and they were into my life too. \n\nSo like that we healed each hurts that we\u2019ve gotten while living in each life.\n\nSince that time, at least no more hate people.\n\nFinally, look inside of myself\n\nWhat do you think what I did while was walking. Most of time, thinking. that\u2019s all. \n\nI thought a lot of crazy funny things that I did before. Because those thinking secretes \n\nendorphins, which relieves pain from walking. Also ex gfs when I started to feel lonely in \n\nnight. even It had started like junk thinking, suddenly changed my sight.\n\nI was started to look inside of myself and had conversation with me.\n\nIn general, I wanted how I look like to others. And I had some role model what I wanted \n\nto look like them. But it was totally not fit me.\n\nEven I didn\u2019t like something about my character, but I had to keep that whatever people \n\nlike me or hat me. I didn\u2019t need to change too hard. Because it\u2019s me. It will makes me feel \n\nlike home. So I gouged myself and sewed my mind for being like me more than before.\n\nIn conclusion, I has been a beneficiary of developing high technology. Also I appreciate.\n\nBut I want to live as human and want to die as human.\n\nI don\u2019t know when it will come true. But I wonder people and theirs life who I will meet in \n\nfuture. Also I want to feel how amazing nature, civilization that human have been making, \n\nand people again.\n\nSo one of my future plan is \u2018walking like wind without money in all the world.\u2019", "subreddit": "friendship"}

She has always been unstable, left behind string of broken relationships and was actually diagnosed with bpd couple of years ago. She is often very condescending about my feelings (and that feature of hers has worsened after being received an personality disorder diagnose) and rude but masks it off by being \u201dsincere\u201d and \u201dhonest\u201d. \n\nI was dating this guy who had quite a few problems on his own and the relationship was difficult and rocky but my god did I love him. Very early I realized that I couldnt talk to my friend about my relationship because anything I told her about that relationship (good or bad) she used against me to remind me how shitty that relationship was and how pathetic I am for being in love with such a loser. She often said that she was on my ex\u2019s side with arguments because I\u2019m \u201dmentally exhausting with my constant need of talking about feelings.\u201d Often said that she is sorry my ex has to deal with me. That hurt a lot and I started thinking that maybe other people actually think that I\u2019m a burden. Well. The relationship ended really shittily and I\u2019ve never been such a mess in my life. Literally it took me about 6 months to be able to say his name out loud without bursting into tears.\n\nWell, my so called friend couldn\u2019t hide her glee when it ended. She never offered me any comfort but actually said that she is \u201dso over\u201d having to deal with my weakness and emotions that she doesn\u2019t want to hear any of it. One time shortly after the break-up I started crying when we talked about my ex and she looked at me blankly and said that I really shouldnt flatter myself thinking that I mean that much to anyone that I should except anyone to having to deal with me. Called me pathetic \u201dbut I still love you dearly... even though you are so draining and weak but I still somehow love you boo boo.\u201d\n\nAnd now I\u2019ve met someone who is very caring and kind, smart and respects me and is interested into getting to know me. And my so-called friend? She is furious. She said that she knows that this isn\u2019t going to work, I really should be on my own for a while (I\u2019ve been single for almost a year before meeting this person) and she actually called him \u201dvery unpleasant-looking\u201d after begging me to show his picture. Asked me how I could have sex with a guy who looks like that. Laughed at my face when I said that I think he looks handsome and said that \u201dsure, you really have no standards\u201d and after seeing me get upset \u201djust kidding, I love you but you are way too sensitive!\u201d\n\nWell the question is: how do I get rid of her the nicest way possible because I hate drama and arguments. She is toxic and constantly drags me down. She is the only person in my life that always makes me feel like shit about myself and thinking that I am stupid. \nI\u2019ve considered about ending our friendship via phone or text and explaining shortly that I don\u2019t need this kind of negativity into my life. Then again, she has a tendency of harming herself and has tried suicide a few times. I\u2019ve called her ambulance or ran into her home when she slit her wrists more times I can count. I fear that if I break up with her, she does something to herself and actually succeeds in that since I am the only friend she has left now. So I\u2019ve been thinking about taking some distance and eventually letting our relationship die in the long run. I just feel like a coward if I do this latter option.\n\nWhat would you do in this situation? Have you had any friendships or other relationships like this?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

(Games give me so much anxiety, but have added to the impact they have, which is nice.)\n\nStarting to watch movies that people tell me to watch, recently watched Big Lebowski, Pulp Fiction, and Your Name. I enjoyed all 3 of these a lot, but it's so weird. Pulp Fiction was the first time a tense movie scene made me sit on the edge of my seat. When they needed to inject the needle I was actually Frozen in suspense. Your Name had amazing music that I absolutely fell in love on top of the interesting movie that made me tear up. The Dude was just a joyride of a movie that I feel deserves a rewatch eventually to enjoy more. Honestly the end with Donny made me tear me up afterwards when it just hit, like yo damn.\n\nI enjoy drawing and sketching but haven't had a lot of practice in the last 5 years because of the BIG D.

About ten months ago a group of ex friends started spreading rumours about me and successfully turning everyone around the group against me. After a month or two off school to recover I returned and joined another friend group which includes two people I've known for twelve years. It's all been going pretty well so far.\n\nHowever, I do suffer from social anxiety, and I'm committed to work against it, but for it to really work I've been told I need a change of environment (I also need to find out when its okay to strike up a conversation with someone Ive never spoke to and how to not be shy from doing so, since I'm autistic this doesn't come naturally, but once I learn how to do something it usually sticks, so that's a positive). It's for a subject I'm really passionate about, but there is one thing holding me back.\n\nThe old friend group are still at large, and some of them have befriended member of my group (of whom are staying on for the last year of high school), and I'm worried they'll try to turn my friends against me and for me to be alone again if I'm not there. (Since, somehow, they're now avoiding me entirely, except for some circumstances when ive caught a few members trying to go near my group.) They share I similar interests and as such I'm worried they'll all join up with each other and I won't be lucky enough to have any friends again both due to social anxiety and no more friends to rely on. I haven't talked about this with my group yet as I don't want to attract sympathy or seem like someone caught up in a big problem \n\nWhat should I do? Should I leave (giving me a fresh srart but leaving my friends) or should I stick in (still with friends but delaying a good chance at a new environment which ive heard is friendlier) \n\n(Also, optionally any advice on approaching people/shyness is highly appreciated!)\n\nAll posts are appreciated!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I am happy that I did because we naturally drifted apart and I eventually ghosted her. (We were both in serious relationships and focusing on college etc.) We would hang out during the summer breaks of our college years but that didn't stick.\n\nMy problems is...during those early years of our friendship, she would make unwittingly racist towards me and make certain remarks in a joking tone. I would just bypass this due to my easy going personality and tried not to let that flaw affect our friendship. When we naturally drifted apart, I often thought about these encounters and racist remarks.\n\nAny time I would make a mistake or say I dont know how to do something she would be like, \"It's because your black\" usually followed by laughter from her and surrounding friends. This went on for about 3 three years of my highschool career. She finally stopped making those dumb ass remarks later in our friendship. When I had time to brew over these encounters, I would get very angry. I started resenting her and thinking of her as a racist bitch, yet I was conflicted because I thought we were good friends.\n\nI eventually ghosted her and we went our separate ways for a couple of years. I was intending on not refriending her but I didn't want to hold a grudge against her.

Having no idea why, I tried talking to her. Nothing. So next step was to talk to a friend who was close to her. Finally after a few weeks, days before graduation, she talks. Told me to stop harassing her friends (basically telling me to stop asking them why she won\u2019t talk but tbh at one point I told the people I was asking if they wanted me to stop I would and I respected that) and she told me I did her dirty and how a lot of the stuff I did was pent up. Meaning she held everything I did in. Not telling me at all throughout our friendship that something was up. She told me that she won\u2019t tell me what I did and I had to figure out because when I do it would be different from apologizing. \nThe convo we had went like this ( not taking pics cuz it\u2019s via snap) \nG=girl M= me\nG: M, I understand you\u2019re upset about me wanting to be your friend but can you please stop harassing my friends, especially *** about it she has nothing to do with it. It\u2019s stressing her out \n(Note: I only asked 2 of her friends who are also my friends and I continuously told them if I was bothering them too much to let me know. They didn\u2019t say although the friend mentioned did say eventually I was a bit bothersome. I apologized, she accepted, stoped asking)\nM: I\u2019m sorry if I bothered *** that much. I didn\u2019t mean to harass them about this situation. I was and am trying to figure out what I did to upset you. Yes I did annoy *** but that was to get to the bottom of this. \nG: I don\u2019t think we can work this out in the future we will fight like this again. To the very most I can tell you a lot was pent up\nI think it\u2019s best not to be friends\nM: May I ask how I angered you if most pent up? I would like to talk it out at the very least I want to know what I did wrong\nG: again like I said it would be better for you to figure it out. It will help you a lot more \nM: that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do. And it\u2019s stressing me out. And as hard as I think I can\u2019t figure it out. I dont know what I did\n( and I\u2019m being very honest here)\nG: if you cant figure it out move on from it may be you will when you\u2019re older \nM: well all I can think about is the trip and maybe stuff I ramble about. I would like to work this out. In my stance I would like to maintain a form of friendship \nG; again like I said me telling you won\u2019t help you. It won\u2019t do you any good. If you figure out. It will be different from apologizing. \nM: but I feel, if you tell me some form, it would give me the time to reflect and remind me of the other shit. Of course I know you can tell me what I did and I can just say sorry but they won\u2019t be the case. Because at this rate, I know a sorry isn\u2019t going to be enough \nG: the sorry won\u2019t be enough because it\u2019s impossible for it to be enough. If you want to change it for yourself not for me but in the future figure it out \n\nOkay so this rant is already long enough but friends who saw this already basically told me she dumped all the issues on me. And to my honest memory, I don\u2019t remember a single time she told me that I offended her throughout our friendship. She basically let a wound I left on her arm  get infected and waited till it rotted off before telling me to fix it. Like what???? So what now? I need some closure so plz help guys.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I really need help PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE THING", "author": "tiredpotato__", "self_text": "So I have this friend, we\u2019ll call her Jessica. We\u2019ve been friends for two years and we considered ourselves best friends. And the first year we became close she was fine. The only thing that bothered me a little was she\u2019s sometimes brag too much about how rich she was and would hint that I wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s fair to say we are both upper middle class. But it was fine because it wouldn\u2019t happen too often and we were best friends. \n\nAnd now this year is where she kinda changed. So I didn\u2019t have a partner for model UN, so I begged her to come and she said she\u2019d do it and she was excited. The last year I didn\u2019t have good partners and it was also my first year competing so I only won once the entire year. But this year I knew what I had to do and I was more confident. So we won our first competition and we were both happy and she said \u201cwe won because I\u2019m your teammate\u201d and I was like lol yea true. And I was fine with her saying that, but then she\u2019d say that for every conference. The thing is she doesn\u2019t do any work. I do all the talking and writing the speeches. She talks to boys and true to get their snap. Which is fine I\u2019m ok with doing the work. But our next conference, I won an individual award which is actually very difficult to do and everyone was happy for me but her. She ignored me the entire ride back to school and never brought up that competition again. At that time I brushed it off and I didn\u2019t really care. But the next conference we didn\u2019t do well and didn\u2019t win, again I did ALL the work and she literally sat there complaining about a boy not talking to her. And when we didn\u2019t win one she got mad at me again.  \n\nOk that\u2019s just with model un. Generally, whenever I achieve something she\u2019s always pissed at me or ignore me. For example we both took the act together and I got a 34 and she didn\u2019t get that and she was mad. And I get that she\u2019s sad but she kept telling everyone that the act we took had a large curve and that\u2019s why lots of people did well. Same thing with nhs when she didn\u2019t get in she got mad. But when I fail at something, she\u2019s literally always there and  is ready to talk about it even when I don\u2019t want to. \n\nThe other thing she does is lie. Mainly about boys. Whenever we\u2019re in our friend group she always brings up that some boy texted her telling her and I quote \u201cyou are so perfect you have the perfect body the perfect smile and you\u2019re rich how do you have it all\u201d. She recently got a boyfriend, which was really been difficult for me Bc all she talks about is him and how many times they make out in her car. And in our friend group there are only two people who don\u2019t have boyfriends/girlfriends, one of them being me, and she always finds a way to bring up me and say that I shouldn\u2019t worry that she would find me someone so I don\u2019t have to worry. \n\nThe problem is sometimes she\u2019s nice. Sometimes she\u2019ll be like we\u2019re always gonna be best fiends and what not. But idk if that\u2019s enough to ignore these other things. \n\nAnd another thing. I was kinda annoyed with the way she was acting, but she\u2019s my friend and I didn\u2019t wanna tell anyone this bc as rude as she is, she\u2019s very popular. So I have another best friend who me and \u201cJessica\u201d hangout with a lot, we\u2019ll call her Stacie . So Jessica basically tells stuff to us the most. Or so I thought atleast. Anyways Jessica is always trying to prove that she and Stacie are tighter than Stacie and I. And  it\u2019s funny Bc it isn\u2019t true since I\u2019ve known Stacie the longest. And the other day Stacie called me and confessed that she\u2019s tired of Jessica and is thinking of slowly cutting ties with her because she thinks she\u2019s toxic. Basically we talked for 6 hours about all the rude things she\u2019s said to us and whether she\u2019s really a good person. \n\nSo for the last few weeks I\u2019ve been slowly talking to her less and less and she noticed and asked me what was wrong. I said I was fine but she kept on asking me and she got annoyed. The thing is I wasn\u2019t being mean to her at all I just said I had finals and I was stressed. I guess she got mad, because when people found out that I was voted Vice President of model un which is a very competitive position, they were happy for me. They didn\u2019t like the other people that were voted and it was a huge problem Bc one senior wrote an email to the teacher on her last day basically trash talking all the people she elected. I hate people making assumptions about me so I talked to everyone making sure they didn\u2019t feel upset with me and they weren\u2019t. But then I find out that \u201cJessica\u201d is telling people about the whole email thing and she\u2019s saying how some of the stuff in the email are true that I\u2019m not qualified. And I don\u2019t wanna get into details, but I am the most qualified person because I have been here the longest and I\u2019ve won many awards and I attend every meeting and participate. Plus everyone that\u2019s on the same level as me agrees. However Jessica just joined this year and is basically trash talking me to everyone. \n\nI know this is long, but I think I had to say all that. Since she\u2019s popular idk how to distance myself from her without hurting my other relationships. But Idk why she\u2019s trash talking same because Ik all of the rude things she\u2019s said  about everyone including the people she\u2019s hanging out with right now. Plus she\u2019s mad that Stacie and I are closer and she can\u2019t trash talk me to Stacie Bc Stacie likes me. So should I just cut ties with her and suffer the consequences or should I expose her or should I continue to be friend with her because this isn\u2019t really s big deal? I\u2019m really stuck, I literally made a reddit account and found this community just so I could ask this question since nobody knows what to do.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

In middle school I was apart of a group of about 8 girls that always hung out in school and talked and we were all really good friends, but I was always left out of everything. They would hang out with each other and go out. I feel like maybe its because I didn't have a phone until senior year, but I always felt excluded. My friends would always tell each other how they were pretty, cute, or super smart, but they never complimented me for anything. I was alwasy the friend they told secrets about the other one to, but would never gossiped about them. They would also just ditch me for people they deemed as better. I was always the person when they needed something, but never like good enough for hanging out. I feel this has been my experience throughout all of my life. Even more so in college, where the friends only texted me for something, but when id message them for just a normal conversation they would just say, lol, idk, or send an emoji. I no longer talk to these girls, and Ive deleted most of them off social media, but they have left me feeling incredibly insecure about myself. I always feel like i have to watch my words: don't come off as mean, loud, annoying, or anything, I can no longer make friends easily, and I'm just overall closed off in general. Now i feel almost hatred towards the girls, like i feel like i was just part of the group bc i was a convenient person to befriend, and now i see all the memories as just fake friendships. I know we can blame it on being immature or petty, but it just annoys me how theyll hang out and talk, and none feel the need to reach out to me. I dont want to be friends with them anymore, but I would like to know that they at least still care about my well being. I want to be able to get over these ironic feelings because im being immature and petty, and why do i want to be friend with someone who doesnt care about me, but I just find it so incredibly ridiculous that after 8 years they all tossed me aside like that, I just want to know that I mattered.  If anyone has any tips on how to overcome this and kinda get out of these feelings, and the internal dilema i am in that be great. On a positive note, i am friends with two girls who were always outcast in school, and they're so sweet and the best people i could ever ask for, who treat me so well, but even that hasnt helped me get over all my feelings.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I\u2019m realistic that there probably aren\u2019t too many people in Ontario on here, so I\u2019m pretty much open to chatting with anyone.\n\nSome of my interests are writing, reading/watching tv/movies, exercising, genealogy, history, and board games. I\u2019d say that I like video games, but I\u2019m definitely quite casual in comparison to people I usually come across on here.\n\nTo extrapolate a little bit on a few of my interests: Writing - I\u2019m primarily a fiction writer, specifically YA historical, fantasy, and supernatural. One of my friends and I are trying to get our debut novel published and build a Twitter following too. Reading - My reading interests are pretty similar to my writing ones, but I also like historical nonfiction and a lot of the classics (I hold an MA in English literature). Reading Red Queen currently and loving it! History - Medieval &amp; Renaissance English / 19th-century American TV/Movies - I pretty much get into a lot of stuff aside from horror, though I\u2019ve gotten a little better about it. Paranormal/supernatural and historical shows and movies are at the top of the list generally. Board/video games: Mostly strategy ones like Civ, Axis and Allies, Risk, Age of Empires, etc. You\u2019re probably starting to see a pattern.\n\nLastly, I\u2019m also trying to learn/polish my French, as I\u2019m new to Ontario and live in an area that does speak quite a bit of it. So I\u2019d love to meet some pen pals or chat buddies for that.\n\nIf you think that we might have anything in common, feel free to DM me. I\u2019m not discriminatory about who I respond to.

I even have friends that only talk to me when they feel like it, so when they don't feel like it and I try to talk to them, they make faces or just sit and stare\nI'm not going to lie, I'm not the BEST FRIEND EVER, but I'd like to think I'm a decent friend. I try to keep in contact, I text and to try to arrange times to get together but they rarely work and it's not like we are full blown \"adults\" yet with kids and families, we're all still in college and I'm the only one who tries to see my other friends. Only once has a friend ever text me and asked if I wanted to hang out.  Hanging out itself has to be a \"planned event,\" I legit have to schedule a time just do stuff together at least 5 days in advance and it has happened that multiple tim s people \"forget\" or suddenly they have to spend the entire day taking care of their nephews or visiting the dad is that they hate and cancel our plans. I just don't get it. \n\nI try not to have a victim mentality, because I know that I've hurt some people but I do value my friends and there is usually a reason I've stopped being your friend. There's this one girl,  we used to be Best Friends Ever, I'd stay the night frequently, we'd hang out during the week, wherever and whatever she did I would do too. Then came along her older cousin and she was mean, she was a b****, and my friend was stuck to her like glue. They'd make fun and laugh at  me in front of people, the cousin would try to kick me or try to hold me under water and my friend would never say anything. So I stopped hanging around her and she was fine with it until her cousin got a boyfriend and stopped hanging around with her. Now she and her mom hate me and blame me for this girl not having tons of friends . I just stopped hanging around her, I didn't tell anyone not to be her friend. \n\nAnother set of friends were cousins, shy, quiet, only hung out with each other so I made it my mission to become their friend and introduce them to all the other people I knew. I was successful and everything was good for a bit, then one day I was in their blacklist. I honestly don't know what happened, we had a great friendship and then all of a sudden they were telling people not to talk to me, telling them to stay away. One cousin would even tell a mutual \"friend\" to tell me she hated me and stuff like that. It was honestly a nightmare.\n\nAnother friend just stopped coming around. She had met some new friends over the summer and they were waaayy funner than I was, not gonna lie, and she slowly stopped coming around and then one day just stopped. I had tried to hang out with her new friends but they were sooooo dirty that I felt uncomfortable. I told her and she said it was ok that we'd hang out other times and I was fine with that, but other times never happened. \n\nI'm just really tired of not having any friends or good friends. My mom always says I need to \"be a friend, to have a friend\" and I try my hardest, I really do, but no one really seems to want to be my friend. I crap at small talk and since I don't talk to family or have any friends I don't really have anything to say.  \n\nIs there a reason friends don't stick around? \nIs there some sort of magic to making friends?\nAm I picking the wrong people to be friends with, or is it just me?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Since then, she had spent time with this guy but made sure to tell him it wasn't a relationship, even though they were sleeping together and she was having dinners with his family on a regular basis from what I could tell. They went to the movies, they held hands, they acted just like a couple. One day he got fed up and decided he wasn't going to do it anymore because he caught feelings, and gave her like a 30-day warning on her cell phone so she could look into setting it up in her own name (yeah, he put her on his phone plan) and everything. This resulted in her phone getting shut off randomly because she didn't take him seriously.\n\nTo keep it simple, she's always talking about being thrifty and telling me what to spend my money on constantly, telling me that I would have to put at least $15 in her gas tank to drive to see me, because we live 20 minutes apart (I am between cars at the moment, if that matters).

Recently, I've learned she has a so-called penpal in another country, who is apparently sending her a giant box of goodies and Belgium chocolates for her birthday.\n\nFor the last several months she has been getting closer to this guy, who she initially tried to hide as much as possible from me (and her other friends), even omitting his gender at one point. I have since learned that he is in his **50s at the very least,** he is an alcoholic, has serious heart problems, and *a shit ton of money.* He took her on two cruises back in January, and then last month, they traveled all over the West Coast of the US. She has a hard time with his alcoholism, she's under the impression that he can just cut down on drinking, because she likes to drink too, she's constantly trying to keep him from driving drunk, rescuing him from concerts and bars, cooking for him, etcetera. \n\nI don't want to take up too much more space, but she doesn't realise that she has an issue with latching onto people with money or people who have something to offer. When she was seeing this guy, I was told not to mention him around her other guy friends whatsoever. She flirts her way into things (random guys buying her drinks or food or something). \n\nApparently, there are four of us who feel that she is being blinded by money but she doesn't even realise it, or she's in deep denial. She got really upset and defensive when I tried to gently bring it up.\n\nI'm her friend that she made when she moved here, 11 years ago. The second friend, is also someone she met here and they aren't as close as we are, but they have been roommates before. The third person, is her best friend from back home. And the fourth, is my ex and her good friend from high school back home. So, the fact that we can all see dollar signs in her eyes so to speak, I think says something significant. \n\nI've tried to help her, I've tried explaining that she can't put herself through a relationship with an alcoholic who doesn't seem to want to quit for longer than a few days, I've been there.... oh, it was hell. But she is so dead-set on him, and now she's telling me they are just friends but it's hard to believe her when she's constantly lying about this guy. The only reason I know the cruises and the trips were legitimate, is because she blew up Instagram and Facebook with pictures and videos.\n\nHonestly, on one hand I feel like I should just ignore it and let things happen, allow her to learn her lesson, but on the other hand if I have to listen to another story about him getting drunk and ruining a social event for her, or how they went on this fancy trip and did these fancy things and how much their food was, I'm going to lose my mind and I'm afraid I will snap on her and just be as blunt as possible. And she's the kind of person who runs away from any indication of conflict.\n\nOh, and whenever we go out to eat, she looks to see how much I put on the tip line on my receipt, before writing one on her own and she **always** puts down more than I did. I usually tip 20% unless the service was bad, so I know it's not my issue.\n\nSigh. Help. \n\n*TL;DR: my good friend has become obsessed with money in many areas, she is dating a guy old enough to be her father, he's an alcoholic, and four of her friends who have known her at different ages in her life, can all see that she's blinded by the money and would never date this guy if he had none. We don't know what to do at this point, since trying to talk to her goes nowhere - she just runs away or hangs up and then ignores our calls/texts.*", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

However my social skills are really bad which makes it difficult to make friends in real life. \n\nI'm a very shy, lonely and boring person. I have a hard time making conversation so I might be boring to talk to. I will try my best. I don't have much in life as I'm searching for work at the moment. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Big Little Lies, The Handmaid's Tale, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03. If you going to message me I recommend you being around my age at least 18-26. Nobody younger or older to chat with cause I feel it would be awkward lol. I can make some exceptions. \n\nImportant, don't bother sending me a message if your just going to ghost. It really hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Also I  don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again. It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have a Kik, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now. Until we get to know each other more. I prefer the pm message box and not the chat but whatever works for you. So yeah just msg me your age, gender, and a little bit about yourself so I know you read all this lol.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}
{"post_id": "c30jsb", "created_utc": 1561059785, "title": "17/M/UK - Looking for a friend?", "author": "lordblobby", "self_text": "Hi! I\u2019ve been writing this post in my head for the last few hours, but I\u2019ll probably still make a big mess of it so sorry! I am really nervous about posting this but here goes...\n\n**Sorry for the long post.**\n\nI\u2019m 17 (18 at the end of the year) and from the UK (England), specifically the Midlands. I\u2019ve slowly lost all my friends (not that I had many) over the past few years, losing my last (and closest) one back in November after years of toxic friendships etc. It\u2019s been 7 months now and I think I\u2019m ready to start looking for friends again.\n\nI am very shy initially, but I will come out of my shell after getting to know people. I do struggle with socialising, but once I\u2019m comfortable I am quite bubbly and chatty.\n\nI\u2019m into lots of different things, I won\u2019t post them all here as there\u2019s not many conversation starters if you know everything about me, but I will post a few so that you know what I like etc. I am very flexible when it comes to trying new things. (After writing this post, I have realised that I gave away a ton of information).\n\nI am a college student \u2013 I dropped out of secondary school in Year 10, did my GCSEs from home and have just finsihed my first year at college, studying Creative and Digital Media. As I have now finished college, I have a lot more free time. My sleep pattern is quite bad, so I can usually talk quite late.\n\nI love animals. I have had dogs all my life, I currently have a boy who is my baby.\n\nI really like listening to music \u2013 I like a variety of people, mostly mainstream pop. I can\u2019t stand rap. I am also really into cheesy 2000s music. \"No Scrubs\" (TLC) is a bop.\n\nCurrent favourite artists include James Arthur, Pink, Lewis Capaldi, Dean Lewis and anything Disney. If it\u2019s Disney I love it.\n\nThat goes for films, too. I love Disney films \u2013 I love the new Aladdin, and also classics like The Lion King and newer ones like Moana, which is one of my all-time favourites. I like musicals, I\u2019ve been obsessed with The Greatest Showman since it came out, but I like loads of other movies. I love horrors, I love comedies, and I like sci-fi, fantasy, etc\u2026 I\u2019m easy with films. Not a huge action film-watcher but I\u2019ve seen a few. I like the Marvel films, but not to the extent where I\u2019ve seen them all and know them backwards.\n\nI like reading, too. Any genre. I\u2019ve currently been reading the Shadowhunters series and also started the Game of Thrones series \u2013 never watched the TV series and I don\u2019t think I would be into it because I have quite a short attention span when it comes to watching things, but I\u2019m enjoying the little that I have read of the book. \n\nI love creative writing (novels etc) \u2013 I always wanted to be a writer as a kid, and hope to work in television production in the future in drama, but that is a long way off for now.\n\nI like video games \u2013 I play PS4 mostly, but I have a few games on my PC (Call of Duty World at War, GTA V, Minecraft, Rainbow Six and Garry\u2019s Mod). On my PS4 I mostly play Call of Duty (the Black Ops series is my favourite, but I have almost all of the COD games) but I also play GTA V, Rainbow Six Siege, etc, and I have loads of other games which I could play, I just no longer have people to play with so tend to stick to one game.\n\nI like Netflix, currently watching Orphan Black but again, I like a variety of genres. I really enjoyed \u2018Safe\u2019 and \u2018Sex Education\u2019. I also watch other programmes on mainstream TV \u2013 I will admit that I like stuff like Hollyoaks and EastEnders, but also Doctor Who, etc. I love the Inbetweeners, mostly because it\u2019s one of the only TV shows that caters for my sense of humour.\n\nSpeaking of which, I have quite a dark, sarcastic sense of humour. I\u2019d probably say it\u2019s quite dry. I will admit that I do swear quite a bit \u2013 it\u2019s not a conscious thing, I don\u2019t really have a filter and I say what I\u2019m thinking. That may be a problem for some people.\n\nThis is partly because I am autistic (Asperger's). I don\u2019t like mentioning my autism first as I like to think of it as a part of me and not the first thing that people should know, but I also think it is important as I know it may be off-putting for some people, as I have experienced in the past.\n\nThis means that socially, I am useless. Pair this with my anxiety (social, general etc) and you can see why I have no friends. It also badly effects my confidence \u2013 I have issues with trust and confidence, especially with going outside etc.\n\nIf you have made it this far, great. But there's some other key things about me.\n\nWithout giving away my life story (because we would be here for a long time), I have other \u2018issues\u2019, namely mental health problems, including (but not limited to) depression and psychosis. I feel it is important that I mention these as I don\u2019t want (all things going well) to make friends and then scare them off when I drop the MH bomb. However, I am amazing at hiding these, after years of practice, and you won\u2019t even know they exist \u2013 I\u2019m not going to bring the mood down and constantly be depressed because I know that people don\u2019t want that, so while it\u2019s there, you hopefully won\u2019t be able to tell, as I am good at hiding it.\n\nSo I am looking for a friend, basically. I typically say that I get on better with females, but that is mostly because I wasn\u2019t into the stuff that made boys cool at secondary school \u2013 football etc, and also because every male I have been friends with has been toxic in one way or another. It is also because I\u2019ve always been described as quite \u2018feminine\u2019 \u2013 mostly because of the football thing, but also because I would always rather sit and talk to the girls than go and wrestle in the dirt. That said, I would really like a male friend. But I don\u2019t mind.\n\nI would prefer you to be between 16-19 sort of age, though I don\u2019t mind if you\u2019re older I guess. But please over 16. And preferably from the UK due to time zones etc, but I guess that's not a necessity, just makes things a bit easier.\n\nI don\u2019t mind race, sexuality, religion etc. I am non-religious and white, but I don\u2019t mind who you are or where you come from. I don\u2019t judge people \u2013 I\u2019m hardly in a position to, and that is not my personality.\n\nLike I said, I have quite a dark sense of humour so if that is going to be a massive problem, that could be an issue, but I am a genuinely nice person and a good listener.\n\nI am very very shy, so I would prefer to message first \u2013 I have Discord, I don\u2019t know why because I have no one to talk to but that is a possibility. Voice chat is a possibility if that is something you want, but ideally I\u2019d like to message first \u2013 even posting this is a big thing for me so jumping straight to VC would be too much.\n\nI don\u2019t mind if you are shy or confident or in-between \u2013 ideally, I\u2019d like somebody who is up for actually talking and not just the odd \u2018hi\u2019 as I have had a lot of that in the past.\n\nI don\u2019t smoke and drugs is like one of the only things that is a massive no-go for me, so sorry in advance.\n\nSo yeah, if you've read this far, thanks I guess, and if anybody in the UK who is 16+ wants a friend who struggles with socialising, drop me a message? Hopefully something comes from this, apologies that it is so long even though I said I wouldn\u2019t reveal everything, though I don't think I've said everything about me. \n\nThanks for reading.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

{"post_id": "c31syu", "created_utc": 1561065734, "title": "Friendships dying out", "author": "leta_17", "self_text": "I have one friend (f) who I've had since middle school (now I am 25) and in the last few years, I've felt like our friendship is very one-sided. \n\nBackground: I became best friends with this person because my previous group of friends ditched me. When I was in 6th grade, I started having massive anxiety issues that mostly manifested as homesickness and being unable to stay overnight at anyone's house. I would still go to parties, but have my mom pick me up late at night. I tried many times to get over this, but it never worked. There was also one time when my best friends mom forced me to stay the night and wouldn't allow me to call my mom even though I was having a full blown panic attack. Anyway, in 8th grade, I found out my best friend was having a party and didn't invite me. I became very upset for obvious reasons and felt abandoned. Part of this is my fault. I was too embarrassed to state that I was anxious to spend the night because of anxiety and I couldn't explain why. I went to therapy at that time (the therapist was horrible) and she kept asking me why I was feeling the way I was and I had no answers. However, I still think it was cruel to not talk to me about this party she was having and I found out that my cousin was invited, and not me when we had been best friends since 1st grade. So I made friends with someone else. We had a lot in common and she was my best friend for years after. \n\nOver the past year or so, I've noticed that our conversations seem very one-sided. Any time I would try to vent about something I was upset with, she would either respond with a sad face emoji, or \"sorry.\" That would be the end of it. She wouldn't ask me questions or try to help me when I was having a hard time. On the other hand, I always go out of my way to support her. I even basically wrote a cover letter and resume for her once when she was trying to get a job. At the time, I was also having a lot of issues with my job and struggling with it, yet she hasn't really responded at all with any type of encouragement. I started to suspect that she just wasn't interested in me anymore, and tried not contacting her for a week see if she would reach out. She didn't.  \n\nShe also disinvited me to her sister's wedding. I don't really like weddings, but she had asked me to go months beforehand and I said I would go to support her because her sister is really hard to deal with. A few weeks before, I asked her what the exact date of the wedding was and she told me I didn't have to go. It hurt me because I had made a plan to go with her, since that's what friends do. She also had invited the other 3 people we used to hang out with in high school, who I sort of split ways with because we grew apart and our priorities and beliefs changed. I didn't feel any animosity towards them because of this, but it was painful to see that she invited them and not me. I confronted her about this and she apologized, but it still hurt. \n\nOccasionally I have tried to see if she would want to do something with me for a few hours, and she would make up an excuse. There was one day when I went to sit by my apartment's pool and had texted her and said it would be cool if she lived a little closer (she lives 45 minutes away from me) so she could join me, and she commented that she doesn't like to sit in the sun. However, the weekend before she made a comment that she was going camping. I responded with \"camping?\" because it was so out of character for her and she responded with \"Yes I'm going camping with my friend because my friend asked me to and I'm supporting my friend.\" There were a lot of \"friend\" mentions in that text. The other 3 friends I mentioned earlier also still live in our hometown, and she is always doing stuff with them. There was one time when she was out with them and I had texted her and she made a comment that she was with them and I was like oh, have fun. And she apologized for not inviting me and said that what they were doing wasn't really my kind of thing anyway. Which may be true, but an invitation never hurts all the same. At least she would have been attempting to include me in her life instead of just writing me off. It's just she always seems to have time to hang out with them, and when I rarely ask her to do something, there is always some kind of excuse. During the last women's march, I made a comment to her about going for the weekend, and she responded with I can't I have school, but didn't even ask when it was, which was on a weekend. \n\nI wrote this off as she was also going through a lot. She was in nursing school and struggling to pass, and so I gave her space. However, she is now done with school, and it's the same situation. I recently was dealing with a lot because my partner's dad is dying, and while he wasn't close to his dad and hadn't seen him for 14 years, he was guilted into going to see him by his mom. It was a difficult trip for us because his mom was so obnoxious about the entire thing and it was clear the trip was all about her and how she felt and not about my partner. This was over my birthday, and my friend sent me a message telling me happy birthday and asked me how it felt to be older. I responded that and made a comment about how I was going to climb a mountain. She then didn't ask me at all how things were going. She made some comments about how she and her cat would take a nap for me, but didn't' ask why I was in Seattle or how things were going or anything. I told her that someone from high school had sent me a message because she is now living in Seattle and asked me how long I was there for, and my friend responded negatively and then tried to talk about her cat again. My parents are also on the verge of divorce, which I've been dragged into and I've tried to talk to her about it, but she hasn't responded with support. I told her my mom had called me one night saying I would have to pick my dad up from work because she left him there, and my friend sent me a sad face emoji and that was all. \n\nI have a therapist now because my life has been a major cluster fuck recently, and she suggested I try to talk to her, but frame it in a way that asks if she is doing ok because I've noticed she's been distant. I'm not sure if I even want to do this. Even if I did do something that turned my friend off, I'm not sure she would tell me. I mean, things can't really get any worse than they are now. I already feel as if I have lost her as a friend, but I'm not sure if I want to keep going through the heartache of trying to talk to her about this.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She just recently moved away a few towns over, and she will be going to a new school once it starts back up again in the Fall. I'm afriad we will stop talking and hanging out after the summer is over, as she isn't really responding to my texts, she either does hours after or ignores them completely. I also feel like I am always the one reaching out, always being the first one to text or ask to hang out. I can't remember the last time she actively tried to reach out to me. We still talk and hang out, but I can kind of feel her wanting to less and less. She is hanging out with her other friends that she has recently made and older ones from the school she is going to, and I can't help but feel like she doesn't want to hang out with me in favor of them. I am glad she is getting more friends, but I still want her to hang out with me too. Is there anything I can do to help re-kindle our friendship? What should I do?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

He can't stay at my house and I have ~~no~~ negative money. He's also seems less physically and mentally healthy than before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend (let's call him Greg, 22.5 years) is currently going through a divorce, which has been furthermore exacerbated by catching his wife engaging in sexual interaction with one of her friends in the house that they rent. Since then (about 3 weeks ago), he has little to no desire to be in that house - and thus has mostly been sofa surfing. \n\nNaturally I want to help while I can, but I just came back from Asia 3 weeks ago and have (maybe) just about secured a job after being unemployed for months - but enough about that. The main issue revolves around the fact that 'Greg' has already stayed at my house for a lengthy amount of time (about 4 months) last year when his eldest sister, who lives in my area, kicked him out, which put my housemates (one of them being my sister \\[simply put I still live in the house I grew up in with her and her friend\\]) under strain, due to not being able to be fully comfortable in their own house, so him staying here really isn't an option, even if I wasn't feeling a need for my own space.\n\nI went on a trip up North with him (I'm from London) for a weekend, which I believe was essential to help him clear his head after the madness of being divorced by age 23, which was nice but also revealed other issues. He seems to have more road rage and is caught up with trying to talk to girls, once spending a good 2 hours looking for a girl we met on a night out by searching her name on social media. It's spilled over to our mutual friends, where one last night told me that he's making her feel uncomfortable, being touchy and what not. I understand that the 'roast', as we call it in my part of London, is real, but he's tunnel visioned quite a bit on her and trying to get with someone in general.\n\nHe's currently sleeping on my bed behind me as I type this. In my head, I feel he should be able to stay at the house that he's still paying rent for, even if it means scowling at your soon to be ex wife for 1 more month. I don't want to be judgemental, but I grew up with my parents barely talking to each other for years; they seemed to be able to get on with their individual lives without breaking into fights (well, majority of the time). However, as aforementioned, he's heavily reluctant to even go back and collect some of his leftover stuff. When he's not sleeping here, he sleeps with his other sister, who has 3 kids - and so can't stay there too long and can't even come home late. \n\nOn top of this, he has come across a consistent slew of money issues. I've already lent him \u00a3600  earlier this year (which he will finish paying me back at the end of the month) and between paying rent for the broken home, car insurance (especially for a young driver) and random issues such as fines (mostly car related), he's once again come to the end of money before his payday. Economically, things will be easier in 2 months time, but what happens when another random expense comes and the combination of his low credit allowance and his friends'/family's charity isn't enough?\n\nMy biggest fear is that he'll end up sofa surfing for longer than just a few weeks, taking a toll on his health (he already smokes like a chimney and frequents McDonald's) both physically and mentally. I've suggested cooking more as a frugal alternative to also introduce healthier options, but he's lukewarm about it. \n\nI wonder what angle I ought to really get at first, but I'm unsure.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Always felt like a couldn't relate to a lot of people, personality-wise or what we liked. Despite this there was once a time when I felt understood and loved by the few friends I had, but not anymore. I still keep them around, we still hang out as much as we always have. But emotionally I feel like they will never understand me and I feel broken inside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis feeling obviously didn't occur suddenly. It developed over a few years where stuff happened between us and I had a lot and a lot and a lot of time to think about my feelings and philosophy and shit.  Explaining it all would take up entire pages so I'll try to break it down:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* A fight and temporary break-up happened between me and my best friend where I'm still not sure if it was my fault or not. In general, I told some concerning stuff about her to who I thought was a mutual friend, who my best friend never made it explicitly clear just how much she hated her. And because of that fight my friend let out all her negative feelings about me that she never communicated to me before. And I was scarred. Deeply. It scarred me that I had spent years not realising I affected her in that way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The vast majority of my friends are incredibly slow responders when it comes to messaging, this includes semi-important to extremely important stuff. And perhaps it's me projecting, but they usually go quiet when it's the important stuff. They got wifi pretty much everywhere, don't really subscribe to much other stuff. I don't even message them every day or every week. And what makes it worse is that I frequently find them online and they never respond, or my message is listed as seen and they don't respond. I'm talking about back and forth conversations with days between single sentences because they respond late. My only friend who responds super fast is ironically an incredibly busy medical student.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* My friends nearly never invite me to stuff. I'm always the one organising outings and such. I've had incredibly busy periods where I've had to go weeks without going anywhere far or doing anything too crazy, and none of my friends ever invited me to stuff even when events were happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Getting really tired of how my friends' standards for their partners vs me are so hypocritical. Yes I know I am not their partner, but their attitude just angers me. Things that they borderline hate about me: Pessimism, atheism, hurtful but valid criticism, they see as quite tolerable or even 'cute' when their partners do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Ever since the big fight happened in point 1, I tried incredibly hard to improve my attitude, since a big flaw that I had ignored was that I was overly pessimistic and making those around me kind of miserable. Still no change in how my friends react with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I've lost count of how many favours I've done for them over the years. Most of them include listening and giving advice when they're going through suicidal, tough times, and giving them bakes whenever I bake anything, and always a gift on their birthday and Christmas. They know I struggle with mental health, they know I think they dislike me and I think of suicide daily. And they still do this shit to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf my friends aren't 'real friends' as some would call them, then I think real friends don't exist.

We did school and work together and now about to continue with school together. I think we are kind of loosing contact, since we started working in the same company he rather spends time with others than with me, he does not even greet me when there are people around that do not like me. We never spend time on weekend and rarely do stuff together. Mainly we just go to the grocery store and thats it for like a week till we do the same thing again. It seems to me like he found some new friends and he does not want to spend time with me. He is out every day with his new friend doing stuff in the city and only does stuff with me when need to, like when he wants me to help him with his car because he does not know how to do it. He also evolved in such a way that he tinks he is a bad ass by listening to rap music and hooking up with his friend which are all  Foreigners and younger than him so he can drive them around. 2 week ago i moved into his department at work and today i asked him what he thinks of it and if he likes it, he told me he does not care, he does this often when i ask him stuff, insted of getting excited he shows no emotions. I kind of tink that i only have contact with him because we work together and share some friends. As a child he was never the popular guy, today he has a lot of fake friend he feels accepted by, he wants them to think of him as a bad ass or cool guy, i know he isn't, He could never fight someone but always acts like he could. I weigh easily double as much as him because he is so skinny. I know this is also my fault, I also do not ask him to spend time with me. I need advice on how to handel the situation, i know speeking to him would solve some of it but i want him to notice something is going wrong, I dont want to take care of the situation if he is the problem.

So some background about me: I'm a 19 year old dude from the UK who loves gaming and I'm a massive computer nerd (what i do in uni). Basically I'm on this subreddit to find someone I can call my friend, since I'm pretty lonely both online and irl :/ I've never been one to socialize a lot either way.\n\nMany times in the past, I've tried to make friends but it would never work out because it would always become one-sided with me putting too much time and effort with no interest back.. soo my aim is to find someone (or them find me) who is also in such a position of being lonely or with problems like depression or anxiety (like me)!\n\nWell enough of this venting! I am actually a little more interesting than the above paragraphs make me seem. Like i said, i love gaming, and in particular, games like Minecraft, GTA V, Guild Wars, Mass Effect 3, Skyrim, Terraria etc, and it would be awesome for me if we could play some games together, and who knows, if our anxiety (acts as double negatives cancel out,) maybe we can voice chat etc! :D i also like a wide variety of music, avis binge watcher of tv shows and movies. I am also often either mature or immature for my age (cue dark humor :p) \n\nBut to the point, if you may also be looking for someone to show genuine interest in your day today, what you had for lunch 2 weeks ago, something personal or just to share some silly joke, then I may be the answer to that. Even if you're messed up with depression or some other, that doesn't matter to me, I only care about you being genuine and I'll be loyal forever!\n\nSoooooo I will bring this to a conclusion, this is s long post xD even if you think i may already have messages (which is unlikely, I'm not cool enough :/) then still send me a message, I will read everything in my Inbox.\n\nBut yeah hopefully I can find someone who is within a decent range of my age so 18 - 23 or so, idc gender or preferences etc, strictly platonic (just have to say the obvious), preferably someone who is in Europe timezones so we're not too different in that context. pleeeeease, all I ask is that you will show back interest in me because I will definitely be putting in effort to make this friendship work! Who knows, we may become best friends, here's hoping!!\n\nWell, CONGRATS if you got this far!

What to do?", "author": "StockIslam", "self_text": "Hi.\n\nI have this \u201cfriend\u201d who I have to grown to absolutely hate. But due to social situations, we have to be around eachother. We\u2019ve known eachother for 3 years. He is quiet, anxious, and an introvert, while I am loud, energetic, and a complete extrovert. Everybody in our friend group sees him as this perfect angel. They will always say (let\u2019s say his name is Mark) \u201cAwww, mark!\u201d As if he is some kind of puppy dog who has done nothing wrong. But I\u2019ve seen him so wrong things.\n\nOver the course of our friendship, we have fought a lot. And it is NEVER because of a problem I have with him. It\u2019s always something he finds wrong with me. If we sometimes do what I want to do over him, he says I\u2019m controlling and I always get what I want. If people talk to him over me, he sees it as me being an attention whore. He lies all the time. We\u2019re in college, and both do theatre. I am a better performer than him, and he gets absurdly jealous. Like, unsettlingly jealous. He constantly mumbles things under his breath, and when I ask him what he said, he doesn\u2019t say a damn thing. I can\u2019t put up with it anymore. But recently, I realized he has been using his \u201cperfectness\u201d as a way to manipulate others into seeing me as the bad guy no matter what.\n\nHe does this by only bringing up his issues with me MONTHS after the situation has happened, and he almost exclusively does it in a public setting with my friends. Almost like a \u201cgotcha\u201d moment. Then, I feel powerless. I\u2019m not going to get into it with him because people will always back him up because he is seen as this amazing, innocent person who has never wronged anyone in his life. But I can\u2019t put up with it anymore. Everything in his life is always blamed on me, it\u2019s way too much stress. He constantly talks about me behind my back, it is hurting me to continue to be around him. \n\nI can be controlling sometimes, a bit of a Leslie Knope at times, but I justify it, and it always seems okay. So he is not completely in the wrong, but he seems like he is never to blame, only because I can\u2019t blame him for anything because if I in anyway call him out for something, I will be vilified because of this how he views himself as the victim constantly. \n\nHelp me. What do I do? Is there a term for what he is doing so I can better describe him when talking to my therapist, girlfriend, etc? I feel so manipulated and like I am the worst person in the world because of him.\n\nThanks!!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I don\u2019t know why she does it but if she\u2019s not right in some topic she is on rage defending her shit even if it\u2019s the last thing she does and she won\u2019t apologise ever. \n\nThe last fights we had were childish, I was doing some project and I needed to count some Latin/roman languages. I of course counted french. She bitches about french not being a Latin/roman language for minutes until I made her google it and prove her wrong! Like dude I study about this sh** and I\u2019m making this project I should know what the heck I\u2019m doing because I\u2019m sure not gonna write bull***!

I would never even dare or imagine seriously beating her up to the point she would be on the floor. \nWe joked about slapping each other out of fun when we\u2019re stupid but I would never actually say it to a friend seriously that I would beat her up. \n\nI lost all of my trust in her that moment, I challenged her to hit me if she wants to hit me so bad, she of course crosses her arms and tells me I\u2019m the pathetic one for getting mad. \n\nTLDR: I just lost all of my trust in my best friend when she basically told somebody that she would physically hurt me for a stupid argument. \n\n\nEnglish is not my native language.

My friends are not toxic or abusive- simply, we all have just know each other for a good while and as we get older our interests are not similar. \nI\u2019ve known all of them since high school. They are nice people, and I never hate when we do hang out. The issue is just that we all kinda stuck with each other because of high school, and we ultimately don\u2019t have a ton of stuff to connect on anymore. But this has made me feel totally forgotten by them. While I seem to lose connection with their interests, a number of them get along super well and I was often being forgotten because they simply *assumed* I wouldn\u2019t want to be there. I\u2019ve communicated with them on this twice before and they seem apologetic and understanding... but time and time again a couple of them will go off on their own, admittedly to a thing I don\u2019t want to do anyways, but never actually make a day to ask me about hanging out another time. I seem to hold that little interest, that they hardly consider hanging out with me, and just me. Unlike other people in our group, because they at least share some interests. \n\nIt might seem clear with this that I should just stop being their friends. It\u2019s been harder to stand as I feel maybe it\u2019s fine for a bit..! But then it\u2019s not- like we have a discord server too and I find myself often posting or saying things I find cool or interesting, even recommending music I think they\u2019d actually like, only for all the people online to completely ignore my posts and take some moments before they go and post other nonsense that ultimately drown out my original messages. \nAre they doing it maliciously? Not sure. Are they just not saying anything bc they have no interest but don\u2019t know what to say? Probably. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing tbh. I don\u2019t think any of them have malicious intent buuuut they aren\u2019t as open about communicating how they feel as I am. I try hard to say when I feel left out. I try hard to tell them when I am interested in their words. But they don\u2019t seem to do the same. \n\nWhat I am stuck on is.... do I just leave? It\u2019s hard, there\u2019s 5-7 of us in total. I am good friends with one girl still but we hardly hang out when she hangs out w the people she has much more in common with. It\u2019s gotten to the point where no matter the intent or lack of intent with their actions, it hurts to sit around feeling like I\u2019m not actually apart of their group. But if I was to drop off, I\u2019d have NO friends. And I struggle enough with isolation, I\u2019d have even less of a reason to leave the house without any of them, so it\u2019s been a hard choice to make.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She's very pissed off - is her claim good, or is she being manipulative?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi All,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really need some advice... Im a F26 and had this girl who I considered my best friend F27. We both live in the US, and we're both originally from the same city in a different country. We also have the same profession.\n\nAbout a year ago, she lost her job, and I referred her to get a job at my company. She then started working there and we became best friends. I had a Junior position, and as she was more experienced than me, I referred her for a Staff position, above mine (I say this bc I could have tried applying for the higher position instead of referring her). Everything was great until a few months ago I invited her to come to my birthday and she had other plans. Ok, I gave her the benefit of the doubt and forgot about it and moved on. \n\nThen, about 2 months ago I got offered another job. I told her at the same time I told people at my office, because she had already given me clues that she can be a big greedy and I'm not too sure if she was going to harm me if I had told her before i give my notice to my boss. I'm a very discreet person and dont like to share news with others until things are set in stone.\n\nOn my last week at the job, the company reached out to me to make me stay, offering me a promotion to a different department, making more money. Now, I'd be making as much as she makes. Then they dragged me along and only gave me an offer letter over the weekend, after I had already packed all my bags and left. Before I left that Friday, I spoke to two of my bosses and they kind of convinced me to stay. Still, I only got a finalized cover letter over the weekend, and made a decision to stay. That weekend was hers and my bf's brother's graduation parties, in different states.\n\nOn Tuesday, I got into the office and everybody was shocked that I was there. I was planning on surprising her with a jump like wooaaah Im still here surprise!!!. But then they came up with this newsletter that broke the news before I told her. She sent me a text with a screenshot of the newsletter and a question mark. I replied back with a meme saying SURPRISE!!! And she just sent me a cold answer like \"ok then your farewell lunch on Friday was fake\". I said that it wasn't, and it had all happened over the weekend. She never replied to that. I called her extension that day and talked to her briefly about her graduation party and asking if it was fun, she sounded very bitter about me not being there and said \"it's a once in a lifetime thing... you missed out\". I said sorry I couldnt go.\n\nThen weeks went by and we didnt see each other. She went on vacation and was out for about 2 weeks. Then about 10 days latter I meet her and another two coworkers heading to happy hour in the hall. One of them (not my friend), invites me to tag along. I went bc i thought why not? \n\nOk, at the happy hour, my friend barely spoke to me, didnt make eye contact. She was clearly pissed. I didnt make a big deal about it and moved on with my life. \n\nA few days later I meet her accidentally by the vending machine. I say \"girl where have you been?\" she doesnt even look at me and say \"i can say the same about you\" I say \"is everything alright?\" she goes \"yea everything is fine\". I'm like... ok.... then I send her a text message asking her what had I done to her for her to change overnight so dramatically. She replied but for some reason I never got her text.\n\nYesterday I was done with it and sent her a text message like nothing had happened \"hi girl, whats up? whats going on?\". No response. Today, after I see her IG story of her girls weekend with her other friend, I send her a text message 'Hmm.. ok then\". 3 seconds later she replies saying everything is fine. I send her again my text messages I had sent her before asking what had i done for her to change so drastically. She said she answered on the same day, and I tell her I never got her text messages. She forwards them to me... \n\nBasically, she's mad because I didn't tell her that I was staying before everyone knew. She was mad bc I sent her the HAAA SUPRISE! meme, she thought that was disrespect. She was mad bc she thought we were the best of friends and that I should have told her before everyone else. Remember how I said above that the only people who knew about the possibility of me staying at the job were my 2 bosses? Well, it seems like the gossip ran wild and everybody knew for some reason. People know that we are BFFs so they were going to her asking her about it and she would say that I wasnt staying, otherwise I wouldve told her. She was mad bc allegedly Im supposed to know she's mad just by a text message...\n\nAnyway, so I told her that I had no ill will about it and saying that I didn't HAVE to tell her and that there was no reason for her to act so dramatically. She basically forgot about my existence until I reached out.\n\nShe expected me to follow up with her that week when I ended up staying at the company and KNOW that she wasnt alright, and go after her to check in on her. We spoke over the phone about it today and she stands by what she did, and thinks that we can try to talk and see where things go, and eventually go back to normal. \n\nI was crying over the phone, so sad and she said that she wouldn't find it hard to ignore people bc she does that even to her husband. She comes off as cold. Anyway, now I'm in tears as I type this bc I had no bad intentions from the first second and she never gave me the benefit of the doubt. My boyfriend thinks she's not a good friend, and that she shouldn't act this way to me. Even after I told her she is having a hard time letting it go and forgiving. I have a very forgiving nature and this is all clearly a misunderstanding, I would def drop it and let it go if it was me. \n\nDo you guys think I should give her another shot, or is she being manipulative? Am I wrong? I need advice.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I guess that\u2019s not unexpected? But, anyways,\n\nHi! I\u2019m Kaylee. I also go by Kay. And I also have a name that I can\u2019t necessarily write out here! I\u2019m a nineteen year old university student. I\u2019m on the East Coast, and I study political science and philosophy.\n\nI\u2019m really not feeling great lately. I\u2019m on the road back from a family vacation right now, and that left me with a weird mix of anxiety and loneliness and just... blah-feeling? I\u2019m not sure I possess the right words for how I feel. I\u2019d just love a chance at making friends. I\u2019ve got this kind of overwhelming anxiety for all the shit going on in the world. I can\u2019t even get a handle of my own problems and I just want to do so much to fix other shit and I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just bad right now? Things are bad. And scary.\n\nAs a bit about me, and to spare myself from having a breakdown, I should share that I\u2019m non-binary. My pronouns are she and they, and I\u2019m also quite fond of feminine clothing and such. You can find a picture on my profile; all that said, I\u2019m not here to explain my identity to you! It\u2019s complicated and my own journey and I\u2019m still figuring everything out. \n\nAside from that, I\u2019m also deaf. I have cochlear implants, too. If you\u2019re ever curious about what it\u2019s like to be deaf, I\u2019m always happy to answer questions. \n\nIf anyone would like to chat, please don\u2019t be afraid to send me a message. :-)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

That's where this post comes in! I try to keep in touch with friends from my hometown and college, but it's hard sometimes with the distance and everyone being busy with their own lives, myself included.\n\nA few things you should know about me:\n\n* I compartmentalize just about everything. You can tell me to go to hell, screw myself, and a minute later ask me to grab a beer and I'll be there. There isn't much I take personally. But this can also lead me to think the same way so...\n\n* I can come off as aloof, distant, or cold. But that really couldn't be further from the truth. I really care about everyone's well-being. There's just a lot of drama that I think are people's own doing and I don't pity people who make their own problems.\n\n* I am brutally honest. I keep it 100, 24/7. It's been known to get me in trouble though. I am terrible at telling people what they *want* to hear, but am excellent at telling people what they need to hear. I also have minimal filter settings. Don't get me wrong, I can bite my tongue in company, but if you get to know me you'll hear some outrageous shit.\n\n* I am outspoken. I have political opinions and I am really not afraid to share them. The great thing though is I don't take anyone's opposing opinions personally. One of my best coworkers is a Catholic Republican and we have very little in common poltically, but we both respect each other's opposing views and no one gets upset. I'm not some raging liberal though. I don't ho around claiming there are a 400 genders, but I do believe in equal LGBTQ rights. If you can't deal with my \"liberal\" views I feel sorry you surround yourself with clones of yourself like the Stepford Wives. I can't do that. I need diverse views in my life.\n\n* Interests include: home brewing, composting, bee keeping (not a beekeeper yet, but someday), programming, engineering, dogs, gardening, and video games.\n\n* Music genres: Quite a bit of EDM, Pop, Hip-hop. Some rock. Just a dash of country -only the fun stuff that you can sing to.\n\nI turn 30 next month too and kind of don't know how to take it. I've accomplished a lot like starting a career, buying a house, traveling, and graduating college, but I have been a loner most of that time. I'd really like to work on the social aspect of my life now.\n\nIf you read this whole thing... You deserve a cookie. \ud83c\udf6a", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I outgrew them.\n\nI used to be heavily involved in the weeaboo convention trash scene. I outgrew that, too, and found that I only had that in common with those friends and subsequently lost those friends. \n\nI'm neither solidly liberal or conservative. Most of my friends (I'm 27, female) are very staunchly liberal. This makes finding common ground difficult as everyone wants to discuss politics. I'm also a huge proponent of animal welfare, and I swear to god I have dropped so many people because they were shitty to the pets in their care.\n\nI want to be more active, take walks, go to the gym, go swimming. I'm afraid to do these things by myself. I'm a very small female, and sex trafficking is pretty prevalent in my area. Crime in general is. I'd feel safer in a group.\n\nI'm not close with my family. I feel ostracized as I've chosen a child-free lifestyle. The goings on in my life do not seem of any importance to my family. It hurts. My mother never calls me, never visits. My sister never calls or visits. When I visit them, it's basically me being left to babysit while they talk amongst themselves. My father is not in the picture; he's an abusive twat.\n\nI feel lonely. I'm married, and we do things together on weekends, but I feel that its unhealthy that he's the only adult that I have a social life with. My best friend lives almost an hour away and I only see her every few months.\n\nI don't know how to meet people, and quite frankly am terrified to try because I feel like I attract psychos. Case in point, one ex-friend threatened to get drunk and get naked in front of my husband. Like, you think you know someone and then they pull THAT. \n\nI'm at a loss, guys. :( I just want someone that I can casually see movies with, or go to concerts, or take walks with.

Thank you!\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info (AKA full autobiography) about me:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate. In the process of joining CAF\u2019s reserves as, planning on Military Police role. \n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned careers, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics. At least, in regards to most topics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, although it had not surfaced for quite a while now; enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n- Chronically single, not that it is pertinent (After all, this is not r/r4r, ~~unless it is~~ - but *no* - I do not want your wiener and / or boob pictures, unless it is a wiener dog or you've a pair cuter than [these ones](https://galapagosconservation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Wildlife-BFB_1000x600.jpg)).\n\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am rather stigmatized against the latter by some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not, in fact, a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandise and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed.\nDespite that, I am in favour of marijuana's legalization so who knows \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Automata, WoW, Bioshock series, Prey, Metal Gear Solid, the &gt;Observer_, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. \nHonestly, for whatever reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nRight now, I am binging on [Space Station 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URJ_qSXruW0), a round-based massive multiplayer game filled with pure autism. Recently, I\u2019ve been playing as the Atmospherics Technician, responsible for keeping the station\u2019s life support operational. In other words, me and another tech accidentally started a nuclear fusion reaction in the gas turbine (whoops) which almost resulted in a mini-Chernobyl. Another shift, a cult was trying to take over the station as I was setting up the turbines, so I took up my trusty fire axe, Jury Rigged a flamethrower (by attaching a plasma tank to a welder) and helped the security team and other loyal employees of Nanotrasen storm the cult bases, even decapitating couple myself. \n\nSo yes, it is.. an odd, but so fun game. \n\n\n(Ahem, tangents. I love talking about my games, as you can see!)\n\n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favourite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \nAlso just re-started Futurama after finishing season 7. Woo.\n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favourite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loathe cheap jumpscares they are so enamoured with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n\n- My sense of humour is possibly the worst, and I take pride in having offensive memes for every occasion ready. Needless to say, I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile stuff. \n\n- My main hobby right now is Airsoft. I spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together since I ordered most of my gear from companies in Russia, not wanting to settle for cheaper substitutes. At least the quality is as good as it gets!  \nThe centrepiece of my collection is my plate carrier which came with full kevlar inserts and is of the model that is only issued to specific units of Russia's FSB. \nPew pew pictures are available on request!\n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I suck at categorizing music that I like, and listen to most genres, so it is simpler to say what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord).\nSeriously though, I am big on modern and older metal, rock, punk, indie-esque stuff, EDM and so on. \n\n I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n\nSome of my favourite bands are Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Muse, Green Day, Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, NIN and many, many more - if it is not obvious by this point, I am so edgy that I (used to) cut myself :D\n\n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%, due to a certain affinity for slithering neck-ties and positive human qualities like ambition, narcissism and general douchebaggery. But hey, at least I am honest (?) :D \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. Stuf like lack o punctuatuion impropar gramar to short n generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit. \n\nAgain, rephrasing the last part for dozens of people who simply don't get it: *you now know a certain amount about myself. After reading your message, I should be able to know a certain amount about you - not asking for something as in depth as here, but the \"Hello my name is X I am from Y and I like Z\" is not good enough.*\n\nAlso, here are some pictures of [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0), because why not? \n\n *Please, PMs only*! I loath Reddit Chat UI. I would prefer to talk here for the first while as compared to going over to certain apps whose names trigger bots..\nThe odds are, if you ignore this, I will either not see your Chat or don\u2019t reply on principle :3 \n... If you did not understand it, I am on the picky side.\n\nFeel free to hit me with your favourite ice breaker / shower question!

The only requirements I am looking for are - you must be older, you must be okay with TMI because sometimes I'll need to vent in detail, and you must have experience with either being an older sister or a mother figure. I am the oldest of four. I never had the older sister experience and I've always felt lost.\n\nOnto my likes - I like horror movies. Video games: Bethesda and Rockstar, mainly. Old TV shows like Roseanne and Boy Meets World and Golden Girls. Most music, we can share tunes if you'd like. I just don't care for acoustic or sad songs because I've found sad songs can trigger my depression. *ALSO: I am a very private person, so it may be a while before I build trust enough to share any photos of me or my life with you. Please keep this in mind.*\n\nIf this sounds like a challenge you'd be up for, please comment down below with your age and how open you are to anything above, along with your interests.

{"post_id": "c3zhlm", "created_utc": 1561266390, "title": "I'm going to be honest with you, Reddit...", "author": "pizzaisnotfood", "self_text": "WARNING: DEEP SHIT BELOW  \nThrowaway account because I'm going to be disgustingly honest about a few things that I wouldn't feel comfortable admitting on my real account.  \n\n\nFirstly, yes, I know, the title is pretentious and the disclaimer about throwaway is even worse, but I do not know what else to do. I am NOT posting this so people will feel bad for me. I just have no one else to say these things too. I tried so. many. times to make real connections on these subreddits, but everyone always ghosts me for the reasons I'm about to explain. So, I figured I better get them off my chest BEFORE starting a conversation, so there are no expectations that aren't met.   \n\n\nI'm a 21 y/o female from the east coast of the United States. My mom had me when she was very young and when I was two weeks old, my dad was in a very bad accident and broke his neck. My mom couldn't emotionally handle having two \"babies\", so when I was 3, my mom left my dad for another man. This, was my dad's breaking point and for the next 15 years of my life, I was physically and emotionally abused. For whatever reason, I like to seem confident on the outside, like everything is fine and that I'm holding it together. Because of this, I never told anyone in my family or at school. Until now, only a handful of people know. I went to a private school and because of my problems at home, I had very low self esteem and had a ton of trouble making friends. Most of the time, I ate lunch alone in the library. I was/am a band nerd, so I hung out with a few kids from there during school, but never had anyone invite me to parties, to sleepovers, etc. I don't know what it's like to have a best friend. That sh\\*t stings. From, like, 12-18, I was constantly online, meeting guys, swapping \"pictures\", entertaining multiple boyfriends, getting all of the wrong attention, because I thought that any attention was better than being alone. During that time, I had a \"boyfriend\" who was my dad's friend. He was quite a bit older than me, I was 12 and he was 19. I didn't realize it at the time, but he raped me. At the time, I thought that was what I wanted. Because he was friends with my dad, he visited a lot.. When I graduated HS, I moved to England to get away from my dad. I was stupid and overstayed my visitor visa by 3 months, but eventually left on my own terms. When I got back, all of my \"friends\" from school had gone to different colleges and I didn't have contact with any. Now, I'm 21 years old, living with my grandmother to help her out, unable to drive, and depressed as hell. My confident exterior is catching up with me. I leave the house once a week to go to the grocery store if I'm lucky. I only talk to my grandmother and my cats. I own my own business that's mildly successful and enjoy playing video games. I tell myself that I'm a decent person, but I'm not really very sure. I guess that reddit isn't really the place to try to make friends, but I don't know what else to do. Please, I'm begging you, just message me. I don't care who you are, your age, your gender, your personal views. Just talk to me. This world feels so big and lonely right now and I just need some words of encouragement. I DO NOT let these things define me, but I would be a liar if I said that I don't think they're holding me back.   \n\n\nI don't know what I expect in posting this. I'm sorry if I've triggered you or if you feel like you've wasted your time reading this. Maybe I'm screaming into the void, but hell, it feels kinda nice to be truthful. If you're depressed, needing of a friend, lonely, stuck in life, message me. We can support eachother. If you're well established, have your life together, etc, still message me. I love meeting new people. There's more to the story, if you're interested in hearing it. I'm sorry that this post is so down, I promise that I'm not usually like this. Take a chance on getting to know me, maybe? I would really really appreciate it.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I (like the rest of you) am here searching for genuine friendships and companions. It's difficult for me to fit into today's society and I've met amazing people on this sub reddit that help with that. If you feel like you're in the same boat as me then keep on reading!\n\nI'll start off with a bit about myself. I am very introverted at first but once we vibe I come right out of my shell. Life has been a rollercoaster and I've just recently started to stabilize and find purpose thanks to my very special Bogan counselor (a Bogan is pretty much the NZ/AUS version of a redneck.) I like to joke and have quite a goofy personality while on the other hand I'm a good listener and provide helpful advice. I'm the type of person to sacrifice a lot of my own time and energy for others. I'm heading into tertiary education next month but am still yet to decide what exactly I want to persue, I've narrowed if down to three options; animal care, telecommunications and tourism. If you think you'd be a good career advisor then I could certainly use your help. There are big ups and downs with each of those pathways.\n\nNow for a few of my interests. I have a guilty habit of spending far more money than needed, especially on clothes. I guess you could call me a shopaholic. I am passionate about anything involving animals, I own two cats, Smudge and Nibbles but my household would be a zoo if it were up to me. It's very difficult to make me smile but cute and funny animal pics make me crack a smile. Video games have been a huge part of my life, my two main games are League of Legends and World of Warcraft, if you're from the OCE region and are a nerd like me then that's a huge bonus. Spotify is one of my best friends, I listen to hours of music every day, I like most music other than Jazz and Country (unless it's Old Town Road related). My usual go to would be mainstream pop, hip hop and my old edgy throwback playlist from high school.\n\nIf you've made it here then thanks a lot for taking the time to read this. If I sound like what you're looking for then please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm always connected to the internet and reply super fast. Either message me on reddit or add me on discord @ Munbase#3837 .

But I am afraid of losing contact with people who I have tried hard to maintain as friends. I hang out with these people for beer and have an annual abroad trip. Once there's alcohol involved, I see them around. But almost on no other occasion, I have their company. In Sweden (a country I have inhabited for 9 years and held so dearly in my heart as home), politics have no place on the bar table. Personal hardships, depressions, and the like of matters with negative tone are kept almost entirely at bay from friends and family. I have less and less to discuss with my group of friends. You can have a company of strangers after a few beers. \n\nDo you think I should completely abandon these folks and start searching for a new type of company where I feel I belong? Have you gone through similar situations? If so, what did you do?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

But most of the time I found myself in this group in the company of an extra fella who for some reason does not like me at all. Every time we make a plan and I realize that this guy is also there, I know that I will not be enjoying my time with my friends in his presence. He's usually bitter and awaits an opinion from me to oppose and humiliate me in front of others. Now, I am no angel either and because of this, I also find myself in a defensive mode. But this is the last thing I would like to do.\n\nThe guy suffers from depression and is bi-polar. He lacks the university degree that I have but has a similar job and I think they pay him quite well. But something about my education robs him the wrong way. I never bring this up but he has asked several times about my salary and would like to make sure that it means nothing to him and that even without the need for an education, he is much better off.\n\nNow the problem is, he is an old friend of my friends. So it's unlikely that he will ever go away. He generously uses the depression card and therefore gets so much sympathy and attention. If there's a gathering, I usually invite this guy even though I really don't want to. But not doing so will somehow damage my reputation. He, on the other hand, does not mind excluding me from his guest list.\n\nIf I am to leave these friends, it is probably going to take me a decade to win new ones!

I need an unbiased opinion so I decided to come to Reddit with this very minute problem I\u2019m having. So my boyfriend [20m] and I [21f] have been dating for 2 years now. I have met his friends obviously, and have actually gotten super close to his best friends girlfriend. Well, his best friends girlfriend has a best friend named Kayla. We (the best friends girlfriend and I) don\u2019t really like kayla the more we\u2019ve gotten to know her because she\u2019s very selfish, rude, passive aggressive, and a little greedy too. She just doesn\u2019t share the same morals as we do. Now, my friend Anne tolerates her because that\u2019s just the type of person she is, and she NEVER says anything because she\u2019s afraid of her reaction. My boyfriend obviously has gotten close to her as well because he\u2019s known her before I was even in the picture. We are upcoming seniors in college so he has known her since freshman year. Mind you, my boyfriend thinks the same of her as we do. Now, the other night we all got together and she really pushed me past my limit, getting in my face and being very aggressive. It took everything in me to calmly walk away, but it ruined my entire night and I stayed upstairs for the remainder of the night trying to just go to bed because my boyfriend past out earlier beforehand. I honestly couldn\u2019t even fake a smile to her for the rest of the time, and I\u2019ve finally had my breaking point. Why should I tolerate someone who I don\u2019t think is a good friend to be or a positive aspect in my life? Is that wrong of me to not want to associate myself with her anymore? If Anne wants to tolerate her, then that\u2019s fine, but when there are events going on at my boyfriends...is it wrong of me to not invite her? My friends have told me to stop hanging out with her if she causes a problem every time but I feel weird just asking my boyfriend to do the same too, even though he feels the same way.

Will this funk ever end?", "author": "greengod210", "self_text": "Just posting on here to say that I have officially hit a funk in my life, and I\u2019m not having the time at age 21 that I should be having.  Part of it is going to bars, but it just as much involves things like going to the beach and on day trips and stuff like that.  I am going into my senior year of college but am currently home on break and doing an internship.  The internship is great and gets me out of the house for 30 hours a week, and I socialize with those people at work, but they are all a few years older than me (mostly 25-30) and mostly just go home after work.  I do the same thing during the week and I am ok with it on the weeknights.  I\u2019ll usually go with my dad for dinner one night during the week also.  \n\nOutside of work, however, I have absolutely no real friends, besides one I\u2019ve known since kindergarten.  I hang out with him about once per week, and we just stay at his house and walk to dinner somewhere.  I like him very much and this is fine, but it\u2019s just monotonous doing the same things every time we hang out.  I say \u201creal\u201d friends because I have a group of friends i am in a group chat with and talk to regularly, but they are not the type to do things spontaneously.  They will require at least 2 weeks of planning even for something simple like going for dinner, and they are too lazy to go on a day trip to the beach or city or anywhere like that.  They are very much homebodies, and the only time I see them is if one of the leaders of the group initiates it and the rest all agree after a bunch of \u201cI have to see,\u201d etc.  So I see them about once every 3-4 months, about one or two times over summer break.  And when they do hang out, they go to dinner, walk around Target for the fun of it and then back to one of their houses to play video games for 6 hours.  Not exactly a fun thing to do every single time we hang out, which never happens to begin with.  They say cousins can provide a great source of friendship, but I don\u2019t talk to or hang out with a single one of them except when we see each other on family gatherings.  I am close to 2 of them, but they live halfway across the country so we can\u2019t just hang out on a whim.  I also have a severely autistic sister who runs my mother\u2019s and my life completely, so it\u2019s not like I have a normal sibling to bond with either.  I haven\u2019t had a girlfriend in 3 years, and that was a single relationship that lasted 4 months.  Never even been on a date besides that.  It really is starting to get old now, and I am 21 years old for goodness sakes.  Once I\u2019m in my 40s and 50s my life will be like this all the time, especially if I\u2019m not married, so that thought is just awful.  I go to lunch with my grandparents either on Saturday or Sunday every week, so that is the only good thing.  But it\u2019s also nice to hang out with people my own age.\n\nWhen I am at university, my friends are lame also, but they\u2019re slightly better than the ones at home.  We go to school in a city, but they won\u2019t go out at all, unless there is nothing else to do.  They\u2019ll go out to eat and sit in someone\u2019s apartment.  I don\u2019t need to be hitting the bars and parties every single Friday and Saturday night, but I\u2019d like to do it more than I do now.  I can count on one hand the number of times I\u2019ve been out in my life, and it\u2019s not impressive.  I actually enjoy it when I go and don\u2019t even enjoy getting obliterated and sick, just having a few drinks and dancing.  During breaks, they live in different places, so no hanging out except an occasional dinner in the city and then we all go home immediately after.   I\u2019m living with 3 of them at university next year, so at least that will help a little I hope.  \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m sorry for this long post, but is there anything I can do at all to get out of this, or is this the way it\u2019s going to be forever?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

We have had a long history (the leaders) and have come away with several relationships that have lasted a long time. Most of us just chat when we have time and want to talk, and we talk about various things. Some subjects that come to mind: banter, our daily lives, politics, and real world stuff in general. We are all very diverse of interest, and all of us are active (we remove inactive people, who don't invest time.) I would say we have a good split of US and EU people, as well as a nice spot of Australians/SEA , and also Men/Woman ratio.\n\nWhat we're looking for is genuine people, who want to make long lasting friendships. The type of person who comes in to the chat and interacts with us, not just posts a meme and leave. If you're shy, socially awkward, we get it. We will allow you time to open up, and none of us are very judge-y. If you're coming in to this community, get ready to explore a world of genuine people with real thoughts and feelings, this is not a meme fest, although it can be. We have several channels and topics of discussions going on, and we're quite active as a rule - politics, not safe, selfies, introductions etc. Introducing yourself and showing yourself are highly encouraged, though not mandatory.\n\nIdeally you will be:\n\n\\- Honest (I do not want meme personalities or personas here. If you have crippling depression we get it, but be yourself.)\n\n\\- Interactive\n\n\\- Willing to voice chat sometimes or be very text-active\n\n\\- Authentic\n\n\\- Be looking for real friends from real people\n\n\\- An adult\n\nThis community is based on that, community - it's not a chat room. We're cultivating friendship, working on talking to each other, getting to know each other etc. Personalities will clash, not everyone will like each other and that's fine. The admins are well versed in this kind of situation from experience, and will know what to do about it.\n\nIf you're interested, please drop a message for the link, and leave a bit about yourself (especially your age!)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Recently I found out 6 of my friends (5 of the ones i went to elementary school with and 1 who we met in high school but am super close with) are going on a trip together and I wasn\u2019t invited. It\u2019s especially hurtful considering the place they are going to is owned by the one I thought I was closest to.

I guess I\u2019m going off to college and it won\u2019t matter in the grand scheme of things, but these are guys I really thought I would be friends with for life and now I have absolutely no idea what to do. \n\nAny advice would be much appreciated.

I felt very ignored and uncelebrated. She got me a dress that didnt fit, which is fine. But instead of letting me or offering to exchange it for a different size, she just says that she will take it for herself. My last few birthdays have been absolutely terrible and she said she wanted to make this one great for me, so why do that? \n\nAm I overreacting?

I talk to a lot of people like one time, but it never sticks. I do have a group of friends but I feel more like I am tagging along with them and that too is only if we bump into each other. They never include me in plans. The common response would be for me to start my own plans. I do, but they come up with different excuses each time. Still, the fact that they even talk to me when I tag along makes them the closest friends I have. In other social statistics, I follow only one person's finsta, I have never been to a formal event with anyone, and I have gone out only two times all year.\n\nI just feel that there are so many interesting people, and so many open minded people, but for some reason they always avoid me! The other friendships I see around are so nice and cute, I can't help but feel jealous and wonder what it would be like to have a group of people to hang out with all the time, to go out with, who constantly have my back. I tried to join a group, it failed. I tried to make a group, well it worked and all the others became best friends but I was alienated. By group, I don't even mind having one or two friends to be with. I knew all along I would have no chance at romance being a puny, thin kid who isn't a student athlete. But I hoped that people would still give me a chance to be friends, since ideally friendship shouldn't be based on looks? Still for some reason everyone goes for the nicer looking people. I can't tell how happy they are, and how true these friendships may be. But they sure as hell aren't the nicest people.\n\nSo yeah that's all, I lost my first year of college.

But I do have to say that I am starting to believe that the sun is out there specifically to get me. Everytime I have to study for an exam the sun just comes up and just wants to burn me alive. That's why I wholeheartedly believe that the sun is a sun of a bitch.\n\nAs you can see my comedy is top notch. Sike. Ha I got you. Now you basically have to finish reading or you will be visited by uhh James Charles? Is that meme still going strong or do I have to replace it with something else. Let me know.\n\nJokes aside let me properly introduce myself before I scare all my 4 readers away.\n\n***Introduction***\n\nSo I am a 21 year old student from the Netherlands who is currently studying psychology. This does not mean that I can fix whatever issues you're dealing with. I mean if I could, I would have fixed my sloppy sense of humour. No but jokes aside, I can obviously try and listen and give some advice here and there. But if you're in need of help never hesistate to reach out to a professional. There is no shame in that.\n\nSoo my hobbies are mainly sports and fitness. I also enjoy my fair share of anime and games. Although work and exams have taken away a good chunk of my time nowadays. I am also super interested in true crime shows. Honestly the only thing I ever watch on tv is Investigation Discovery and maybe some other Discovery channels. The rest is just boring to me to be honest, cable tv anyway.\n\nA sense of humour is important to me. I joke around all the time but I can be serious if needed. Sarcasm is another thing I do a lot. Some people get it. Some people don't. It's like speaking a foreign language. Speaking of languages, not to flex but I speak 3 languages and crippling croissant. ~~proceeds to flex~~\n\nThings I hate: People that like Brussels sprouts. (Y'all crazy), People that are obsessed with their horoscope. \"Ohmmyygawd you're a pisces, I can't trust you sis\", People that wear sandals with socks. People that use internet slang irl. (yes I have seen people say LOL in real life), honestly the list could go on and on. But the thing I hate the most. God just thinking about it infuriates me. ***The people that put milk in the bowl before the cereal or cornflakes.***\n\nHonestly though, I am just looking for people to talk to about anything and everything. I am pretty open for the most part. People interest me. ~~In a non creepy way lmao~~ So let me know if you'd like to talk people, everyones welcome. Even you people that put brussels sprouts on their pizza.\n\nPS: I know, I used the same text in different subreddits. But give me some slack. I am a guy, I only get like 2 messages from a post if I am lucky and that second message is usually the prince of Nigeria trying to get me to inherit his millions in gold. :(", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Only a few buy me a room at a motel and our journey continues on for some days, maybe a week. But I still get kicked out at the end.

My life is currently going very well, I'm living in a very good area with my best friend which is my coding poney (I coach him and try to motivate him ect...)\nI'm a fan of science, biology and video games. I've already coded some games and I'm very invested in esport as a spectator, especially rocket league (even through I'm only platinum) and csgo (global elite / was semi pro in css).\nThose two games are my favorites, as well as the souls serie, especially dark souls 3.\nI've never had any relation with a girl and I believe having such relationships is useless, probably because I've never met a girl that fits me.\n\nNow for my past. I like to say that I come from hell. My father was the kind of father that gets very violent and hit his whole family, or get depressed and wanna suicide. My parents divorced when I was 6 years old. Then I was left alone with my mother, which I had to take care of since she was drinking a lot of alcohol and taking Xanax and dangerous stuff like that. Spent a lot of time hiding bottles and stuff... Not the best childhood, which led me to being uber depressed and dropping school at 14y old. Tried to suicide multiple times, which is an extremely stupid decision, but you often realise it too late. Then I spent 4 years stuck in my home, never going out (I've went out twice, once for a wedding and once for a funeral, in a bit more than 4 years, only two days...) obviously I've been on the computer all that time, which led me into being pretty good at video-games and coding / hardware.\nAfter that, when I got 19y old , I've went outside more and more because I got accepted in a hardware maintenance class, that's where I met my current best friend. \nThey quickly realized I was really good with computers and decided to send me into an engineering school to learn software development (and they even paid me but I had to get the best results each months) I've successfully managed to get my friend with me by teaching him code so he could pass the tests too. Then I've been learning, eventually ending up at the top. And here I am.\n\nObviously I like to type a lot, I also like to talk about myself because that makes me realise that you always end up where you meant to be in your life, and that I've been improving all the way and that motivates me to keep going.\n\nI'd love to add you on discord or WhatsApp or snap or smth and get to know you, gender or age doesn't matter even through that's the first thing I'll ask haha. I believe I can provide useful advices and some good ideas on how to progress as an human being. Also I like to give motivation and cheer up peoples. I'm open with any subject as long as it gives me knowledge or it's fun / interesting.\n\nI'll be waiting for you ! (free lemonade for people that read the whole thing)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I have news for the few people out there who are not aware, and if you or someone you know has ever been bullied, you know it too. Words do matter and they do hurt me.\n\nWords have always been important to me. What people say, what they don\u2019t, what they omit and everything in between. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause often people say the opposite of what they really want to say. Sometimes it\u2019s because they don\u2019t know how to express it. Sometimes it\u2019s because they want to convey a message in a passive aggressive way because they don\u2019t know how to be direct. Other times, they are simply mean. Regardless, I have learned that words can trigger many things and many emotions in me. I have learned that I often listen to the unsaid and read between the lines. My brain is always going 100 miles a minute. That's 160 km/hour for us Canadians. \n\nSay what you mean and mean what you say! \n\nI say this often, and I will keep on repeating it.\n\nI observe a lot. Observing a person\u2019s reactions, but also observing the way in which they express themselves, (that goes for internet chats as well, where you can't see the person but need to \u201cfeel\u201d them.) which is a second language in itself (non verbal body language). One that doesn\u2019t always jive with the words coming out of our mouths. \n\nThe words people decide to use will say a lot about themselves. We whisper them, we sing them, we scream them, we cry them, and when we can\u2019t say them, sometimes we write them and use our body to show them.\n\nWe can down play the meaning of our words. We can manipulate, we can hurt and we can destroy with a simple few words. Then again, our words can heal, they can uplift a person\u2019s spirit and they can give them the confidence they need to believe in themselves. Words can give hope and mend pain. Reassure and give love.\n\nYou see, communication will always be at the heart of everything I say, do or write, and probably at the core of every post. Miscommunication too, because you can't have one without the other, and inevitably I think it pushes the conversation towards all the different perspectives and perceptions people might have.\n\nSo if words are important, what happens when we\u2019re dealing with people who are simply careless with them? You know the ones, because they\u2019re in your life as well. What about those people in our lives who can\u2019t express themselves with care? And what if they are the close ones?\n\nHow do you protect your child from stupidity and carelessness? How do you explain that stupid adults do exists? How do you help their little brains comprehend that they are not in the wrong to question carelessness and extremely egotistical behavior? How do you take their pain away? How do you fix it? I can't fix this...\n\nThat\u2019s when I turn to words. I try to put meaning into them, try to explain and define them. That\u2019s why they are so important to me.\n\nWhen I look up the word definition for Carelessness in Google, I get this:\n\nFailure to give sufficient attention to avoiding harm or errors; negligence.\n\nWhen I look up the word definition for Stupidity in Google, I get this:\n\nBehavior that shows a lack of good sense or judgment.\n\nYou see, I use the words I see fit. Because I know the meaning of them. I don\u2019t use them lightly or casually. I try not to use them carelessly. I\u2019ve been called finicky. Yeah, and?\n\nBut what about emotional carelessness or failure to provide emotional care? There are many articles. I found these two in a simple click: \n\nHere:  https://www.allrelationshipmatters.com.au/insights-healthy-relationships/emotional-neglect and, Here: https://theintrospectivemindsite.wordpress.com/2016/02/09/does-careless-behaviour-mean-not-caring/comment-page-1\n\nWhat does it mean to you in your daily life? How do you cope? How, do you cope?\n\nEmotional carelessness is resumed to this, in my own words: \n\nA person that doesn\u2019t take the time to reflect on the impact of their actions. A person that doesn\u2019t stop and ask themselves, Can this harm or impact negatively the people I love? Most importantly, emotional carelessness, to me, is defined as a person\u2019s inability to look beyond their own self satisfaction; minimize the impact, minimize its effects. Someone that will shrug it off and make excuses. Emotional carelessness also goes hand in hand with emotional immaturity and stupidity, in my opinion.\n\nIt causes hurt, the intangible kind. It leaves wounds the size of the Grand Canyon. It lingers on for years on end. It affects a child\u2019s emotional responses all the way through his/her adult life.\n\nWhat can I do? \n\nI can care. Pay attention. Be present. Mind my words and mean what I say. Pussy footing around doesn\u2019t do anyone any favors.\n\nWhat about you? Will you care? Will you mean what you say and say what you mean?\n\nWill you think beyond your words and the full impact they can have on a person? I can watch my words, but I can\u2019t watch yours. \n\nCalling all Care Bears. I care, I care, I care!\n\nJosie Q.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

In public I sadly don't have many friends and most of my friends are on here from Reddit. I've met some great people on here and I hoped I can meet some more interesting people to become friends with. Don't worry about those I'm already talking with I will still talk with you. Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nI just recently graduated from college with a degree in film. I suffer from both anxiety and depression. It effects me a lot on day to day basis mostly depression. Some days I'm fine Some I'm not. So if I complain about being depressed please understand I can't control it and at least be sympathetic towards it.\n\nI'm also somewhere on the spectrum. Its not as severe as other people probably, like you wouldn't think It because I'm on the high functioning side of the spectrum. However my social skills are really bad which makes it difficult to make friends in real life. \n\nI'm a very shy, lonely and boring person. I have a hard time making conversation so I might be boring to talk to. I will try my best. I don't have much in life as I'm searching for work at the moment. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Big Little Lies, The Handmaid's Tale, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03. If you going to message me I recommend you being around my age at least 18-26. Nobody younger or older to chat with cause I feel it would be awkward lol. I can make some exceptions. \n\nImportant, don't bother sending me a message if your just going to ghost. It really hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Also I  don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again. It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have a Kik, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now. Until we get to know each other more. I prefer the pm message box and not the chat but whatever works for you. So yeah just msg me your age, gender, and a little bit about yourself so I know you read all this lol.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I'd be happy to talk about it over reddit messages (not Reddit chat), Discord, or even IRL if you're around NYC/Westchester NY. If you're up for it, I like talking to people 21 and older. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now, I'm reading a book of short stories by Jorge Luis Borges. He seems to be into heady stuff like labyrinths and vessels of knowledge. I've also read:\n\n* Tolkien's Middle Earth works. My favorite is *The Silmarillion*, since it covers a lot of history from the beginning, it has a lot of tragedy and even GOT-like events, and takes place on an epic scale with a creation story and divine intervention. \n* Pretty much everything by Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, with my favorites being *The Brothers Karamazov* and *Anna Karenina.* I like seeing a wide variety of characters go through existential challenges, philosophical questions, and the unique challenges of their time periods and societies. \n* *Neuromancer* was also a really good book; *The Matrix* and a lot of cyberpunk sci-fi is heavily based on it, for good reason. I should maybe also read *Altered Carbon* sometime, since I really enjoyed the 1st season of that show and am looking forward to more. \n* I've read most of George Orwell's works. He had a lot of good social commentary and insight about authoritarianism, though I don't remember *Animal Farm* as well as the other stuff he wrote. \n* I've read some historical fiction like *The Killer Angels* and *For Whom the Bell Tolls.* I'm heavily into history and like seeing how people with their own goals and fears handle it. \n* I've also enjoyed a lot of non-fiction works in history, sociology, and philosophy, though I haven't read much of that recently. \n* My all-time favorite book so far is Umberto Eco's *The Name of the Rose.* I first got into him from his insights into the symptoms of fascism, but that book really hit me. It's very similar to *The Brothers Karamazov*, and I'm a fan of how it covered the relationship between religion, society, and politics, and how the mystery plot went. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I'll probably read next is *A Canticle for Leibowitz* and the Harry Potter series, but I'm open to suggestions!

We went to Taco Bell afterwards. My friend offered to pay the bill. My sister and I had family sleeping over and were talking about my cousins being over and wanting Taco Bell as well so we got a 12 box for us all to share. My friend expressed she only wanted one taco from the beginning, which I thought was weird considering she offered to pay for the bill. So, I told my friend I would Venmo her back because it wasn't fair in the end that she only wanted one taco. After we dropped her off and my sister and I got home, she texted me angry. She said she heard me say \"(her name) got it\" and never heard me say I would Venmo her back. I expressed to her that both my sister and I never heard me say that (which I didn't and would never say to someone) and I did in fact offer to Venmo her back immediately after we paid. So she has been mad at me and isn't returning any of my texts and honestly, I don't know what else I can do. She's treating me how she would treat ex-boyfriend, in the way that when she's upset at him for something and she's expecting an apology, she'll just give radio silence until she gets what she wants. HOWEVER, I don't believe I did anything wrong and if I did, I asked her to let me know why she was upset so I could fix the problem. But still, radio silence. So am I missing something? \n\nTLDR; Friend offered to pay bill. Got upset after paying for it and is mad at me for something I did last night, except she won't tell me why.

She was pretty nice and  liked the same things as I did. She told me that she had ADHD, but I didn\u2019t mind that she talked a lot. My friend group liked her too until something happened at the start of junior year. Something happened at Destiny\u2019s middle school that made local headlines. One of my friends tries to express her opinion about it, but Destiny started an argument and said my friend was wrong. Every time my friend tried to say something, Destiny would quickly snap back and cut her off. \n\nLater, I started to realize Destiny and another person began to break my group apart. They would only talk to me and another friend of mine but no one else in the group. They would \u201ccage\u201d us into conversations and make sure they sat next to us so we couldn\u2019t talk to anyone else but them. \n\nAnother aspect of Destiny I\u2019m having a hard time with is her bragging. It\u2019s not bad to tell a friend of an achievement you\u2019re very proud of, but it\u2019s unnecessary when you tell every single thing. She would make me guess what she got on tests she did well on, or she would indirectly tell me that I\u2019m not as good as her. Another thing I really despise is when she talks about standardized testing. I fucking hate it so much, and she knows I suck at them. So when she got a higher score on the PSAT, she decided it would be ok to announce to the world that she did better than me. I try really hard in school to keep up my gpa but that really hurt when she said that. \n\nSorry I made you guys read all of this.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Advice needed!", "author": "anynymous_1", "self_text": " \n\nThis is one of those fucked up experiences that i don't really know how to handle.\n\n**Background:**\n\nI know this girl back from college. We were never super close friends but we were friends and would talk/hang out once in a while. I don't like to say this but she's a bit of a **weirdo**. She thinks she's very cool but she's not. I am the type of guy who respects women so i never said anything inappropriate to her. Sometimes she says things that would piss the fuck out of you but i tried to remain patient. She will disrespect you and then act like as if its ok. I am the kind of a guy who loves jokes and stuff and i can take a joke very well but what she would do was disrespecting which she thought were jokes. As i said, we were never super close friends so after college finished, we didn't stay too much in contact and also the fact that she isn't the type of personality that i can cope with so i also didn't make much effort. BUT, she would contact me once in a while to say hello/hi to stay in touch which i appreciated. She always trusted me i guess.\n\nLong story short, a year or 2 ago, she was going through a rough patch (as we all do sometimes in life) and she started contacting me more and more. I was trying to be there for her and support her as a good friend. Then one night she's telling me that she thinks we should have dated back in college and bla bla. Kinda like flirting. I told her that i am with this other girl so its not very appropriate to have such a conversation. She was like 'be cool dude', i am just flirting for fun, don't be so tied up. anyways... We never talked about that after that.\n\nShe moved to another country for a job and she's miserable at her job. We talk almost every week and she complains about her job for hours and hours and i listen (try to be a good supportive friend). She was so stressed that she started having health issues. I wanted to support her emotionally.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\nShe recently found another job and i am very happy for her because she wasn't happy in her previous job. She messaged me that she needs a favor. She needs to attest her university degrees for the new job and if she doesn't, the govt will ban her and she will never be able to work in that country anymore. The degrees needed to be attested from the country where i am (the university we studied was here).\n\nI had recently sold my car and the place was far from my place so I told her that i will have to take leave from work and all but i will talk to a friend because he goes there often. My friend couldn't do it because he was busy so eventually, i took a day off from work, rented a car (through my friend's account bcz i am not registered with that car rental company), went all the way there, stamped her degrees and the last step was to submit those degrees in the embassy. The next day i asked my good friend for a favor to go to the embassy and submit the degrees there. Guess what, the embassy rejected and said that documentation is not complete. They needed the attestation stamps on some other documents too.\n\nI told her that the embassy rejected and i can't take another day off again to go back and attest those documents too. She replied, i don't know what to do and i will get a life ban and all. I felt ban and to be honest, i understood her situation and obviously i didn't want her to get he ban. She said i really need to get it done on the next working day and make sure to send the documents back to her so she can submit them on time. So guess what, i took another day off from work, rented a car again and went there again to attest all the supporting documents too. The next step was to submit those documents in the embassy. Unfortunately, the car rental time was expiring so i had to make a choice whether to go back and return the car or go to the embassy to get her work done. I thought that maybe the car rental company woujld put a penalty on me which 'obviously my friend would be willing to pay because i am doing all this for her and to make sure she gets the documents on time'. So i ignored the car rental expiry and drove to the embassy.\n\nThe car rental company started calling my friend who's account i was using and she got super upset and mad. She had all the right to be but she's a very good friend so i knew that i will make it up to her later. She was really really mad at me. All this for who ? For the friend who needed the documents.\n\nAnyways, embassy finally accepted the documents and asked to collect them back in few hours. I got home, apologized to my friend (almost 50 times), then took a cab and went to the embassy again to pick up the documents and then went to DHL to ship it to her so she can get them on time.\n\nAfter DHL was done, i sent her pictures that everything was done. She called me to thank me and to apologize for all the mess she put me in. I was exhausted, tired and quite mad at this point.\n\nShe asked about the cost. Originally i wasn't gonna charge her because i didn't know if this whole thing was going to cost almost 300 dollars. I told her that i will let her know the costs and also the penalty i had to pay for the car. And she's like 'Why do i need to pay the penalty and its not her fault'. This was the moment when she really fucked up and i flipped.\n\nI got really really mad and i was like 'are you fucking kidding me'. Don't you have the decency to realize what i went through the whole day for you and you are going to argue with me on the penalty. And it wasn't like i got a traffic fine because i banged the car, or got a ticked. It was a penalty because i didn't return the car on time. I told her pay me what you owe me and we are done now.\n\nThis was the moment when she started showing her real face. Now she's calling me asshole, disgusting and all names and saying that i broke her trust and i am dying for my money. Honestly, i don't give a fuck about money because if i did, i wouldn't be thinking of not charging her initially. But the way she treated me, i feel like a fucking fool.\n\nShe's saying very rude things to me on messages but as i said earlier, i like to keep the boundaries of respect so i keep telling her to return my money and we will be done. Last night, she said stop harassing me and she blocked me on Facebook.\n\nI am very hurt, very shocked and to be honest, i am not surprised because i have always known her. But i didn't know she would go down to this level. There's a part of me that really wants to teach her a lesson for life.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

In their case it seems like an outlet for whatever negativity they felt towards me.

I'm really upset and confused about this and cannot sleep so here goes.\n\nMy(23F) very close friend(24M) drove up 4 hours to see me this weekend. He had been planning to come for a while and I was really happy to hang out with him. When we were planning his visit, he asked me if I was interested in hooking up over the next few weeks till he leaves the coast for good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently went through a breakup with my boyfriend of 4 years due to long distance. It ended amicably and we're good. But the past one year was terrible because of the distance and said friend was there throughout. So he saw how much I was and still am in love with my boyfriend and how difficult it was. I've been on Tinder for a couple of weeks, not sure what I want but I think just people. Friend knows about this and that I'm not looking for anything serious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCouple of days before he came he asked me if I was interested. I told him I didn't think so and he wanted to talk about what was stopping me and what I thought could go wrong. I told him our friendship was important to me and I think it would be weird because we had grown to be close friends so it was difficult for me to think of him like that. Honest reason was I just didn't want to. He tried to convince me over the phone many times, saying how us being close and comfortable was an advantage and hence nothing would screw up our friendship. Also we wouldn't be hooking up for too long so neither of us would fall in love (his logic). I thought it was better to talk about this face to face so I told him that we would discuss it. But he wanted to know before he came (not sure why). He even said he would make sure he came if we were going to (Red flag which I pointed out to him - but he dismissed it saying \"Obviously I would come either way, is *this* what you think of me now\" so I let it slide).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen he finally arrived we spent the evening with our friends and he brought it up when we were alone. I made it clear that I wasn't interested. I made a few reasons about friendship which he wasn't buying. I said \"I don't want to\", \"I don't feel like\", \"Just because I'm looking for something casual doesn't mean I just sleep with everyone\". He still kept trying to convince me saying I should atleast try, was I never going to even try to move on, and he knows I'm okay with fwb so if I don't want to do it with him why am I doing it with random guys on Tinder. It was 3 am, I was uncomfortable and exhausted. The thought crossed my mind - should I just do it to avoid this whole drama?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only reason I didn't shut him up was because I had gone through multiple friend-breakups very recently, and he was one of the people from the same friend circle who I was on good terms with. I didn't want to upset him and lose another friend. He's sensitive and I know once I tell him this, he's never going to talk to me again. The thing that finally shut him up was \"If you really care about me, you shouldn't even need a reason. If I'm saying no you should just accept it.\" After that he became all sulky and was like that the whole weekend. I tried to talk to him about why he was upset but he turned the whole thing into a trust issue and on me and we basically just fought the whole weekend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really upset because I didn't like the way he was behaving. This is someone I've grown to trust. It's okay he asked me, but he kept insisting, and I could just feel the difference every time he touched me or hugged me. It wasn't the friendly touch I always got from him. I want to tell him this was uncool but I know he's never going to talk to me again. Then I think is this friendship even worth saving? But like I said I've lost friends recently due to circumstances and some bad decisions. I think he kinda knows that I don't want to lose him and he was exploiting that power.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I tell him how I feel? If yes, how?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Close friend asked if I was interested in FWB after my recent breakup, when I said no he tried very hard to convince me. I don't want to lose him as a friend but he made me really uncomfortable and kinda got mad when I kept saying no.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We met at work and became friends, hung out outside of work and had been friends for about 3 years. I am no longer there, I left about a month ago but she still is. Earlier this year, another coworker, told me she\u2019d heard a rumor about my friend. I instantly got mad and I asked her who said it and where she heard it from? There was always a rumor about someone almost monthly. \n\nShe hesitated and then said, \u201cyou know what? It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I made the decision right then to not indulge in something so stupid and untrue. I walked away. It bothered me for weeks and still does but not as much as it did in the beginning bc I knew it was not true and tried not to let it continue to bother me.\n\nFast forward to a week ago when she\u2019d heard it. I told her I heard but knew it wasn\u2019t true and I tried to clear the air about it. She wasn\u2019t hearing that and we got into an argument. She told me she was mad at me, I asked why she was and why was it my fault. She said not to victimize myself and she is only upset with me because I didn\u2019t tell her right when I knew, knowing it was going around. \n\nAgain, thinking it was stupid and untrue did not matter. I made a mistake and in not telling her that I\u2019d heard, is why this friendship is on the rocks. She never said she didn\u2019t want to talk to me again or anything. I tried reaching out to her yesterday via text and later that day, I noticed it didn\u2019t say \u201cdelivered\u201d like iPhone iMessages normally do and it stayed that way. I haven\u2019t tried calling but since she was angry, I wanted to communicate slowly and thought a short text would be okay. She loves her phone and is always on it. Is she possibly THAT angry at me she blocked me? If so, that hurts and I\u2019ll have no choice but to accept without any real closure to this situation. I\u2019m thinking why not tell me we\u2019re not friends instead of possibly blocking me? Here I was thinking she\u2019s just mad and needed space.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I use the term friend lightly since I also found out she had been posting slanderous blog posts about me with pictures and information.

I presume it's from a jealousy on her part, particularly regarding my relationship. She was v calculated and the way she slept with my, now ex, boyfriend was in a calculated way.

I've known her for 5 months now, and 4 days ago we got into a fight. Jasmine had agreed to go see a festival with me and two of our other friends on Friday evening. When Friday came along Jasmine disappeared. She stopped responding to messages and calls from me, and over all ghosted me. I felt really disrespected and that my time was wasted since I've made a plan b with my mother. Basically if Jasmine decided to cancel our plans, I could get a ride from my mother to her place in another city hours away for free (I'm a student so money is tight). The problem was, I never heard from Jasmine. My mother who came to pick up my grandmother (she's too old to drive anymore) couldn't stay and wait for me any longer than 6 p.m. so she told me that if Jasmine hasn't responded to me by then my mum would go without me.\n\nWhen 5.30 p.m, the time we were supposed to meet with the group, rolled around there was no word from Jasmine. So I called one of the boys in the group to ask if he has seen or heard from Jasmine. Apparently he had heard from a mutual friend between Jasmine and him, that she had gone to a cottage party Friday morning and come back Sunday evening with the rest of the cottage people. Now, I was aware that she was invited to the cottage party but she said she didn't want to go because I and the rest of the guys weren't invited. The host of the party didn't want any outsiders to the gathering, and due to my chronicle arthritis and the medication I had to take for it I wasn't allowed to drink any alcohol, so Jasmine felt like I wouldn't enjoy my time anyway ('cause alcohol is a necessity to have a good time).\n\nI got really angry when I heard her reasoning and the fact that she decided to ghost us. If she had told me the morning she left that she was going to the cottage party, my plans with my mother would not be ruined and I wouldn't have to pay for an expensive bus ticket to the other town. The rest of the group didn't get as angry as me since they're used to her whimsy ways to change plans.\nI admit I shouldn't have send her an angry message but I did. basically I said: \"Next time you decide that you want to go somewhere without us, don't f****** ghost us. Sending a text message it's not that difficult.\"\n\nAt first Yasmine responded with \"yeah I know I'm such a horrible person\". This made me feel like she was trying to guilt me into saying: \"oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean it like that\", but at that point I was too angry so I put the phone into my bag and went to the bus station.\nLater on the bus I took my phone out of the bag and noticed that there were many messages from Jasmine. \n\nBut here's the kicker, they weren't from Jasmine, those few messages were from a mutual friend of ours called Belle. She had taken Jasmine's phone and decided to give her piece on the situation. She told me: \"How f****** dare you to call Jasmine out. You weren't invited here, and nobody wants you here. You're just a killjoy who can't drink so you would be boring anyway. I get that you're obsessed with Jasmine but leave her alone and get a f****** life. Get over it, idiot.\"\n\nThis moment made me flashback to the middle school and high school days where group of girls would bully me for years. I reacted by impulse and told Belle, the calling a chronically ill person a killjoy because they decide to be conscious and not on the floor dying from liver failure it's kind of a shitty thing to do.\nAt that point Jasmine took her phone back and started firing back at me. I think Belle told everyone at the cottage party about me, since Jasmine's messages didn't make any sense to the context and sounded like she was told what to say. To keep it short she basically said I'm a strong independent woman, I'm allowed to do whatever I want, you can't stop me, you can't control me, I do something without you for once and you react this way, I can't deal with a difficult person like you. \nI basically responded to everything she said, and this went on for like a 30-minute back and forth. At the end I told her, that we are just lashing out at each other for no reason, and that she should read my messages and not just respond blank statements that had nothing to do with the argument. Then I blocked her. \n\nAt this point I want to make a few points clear:\n- Everytime me and Jasmine went out with a group of friends or not, I was invited. Jasmine always called or texted me where we are going, when she would pick me up and who was coming. Only once did I invite her.\n- For some reason Belle doesn't like me. I've tried to be friendly to her, but always she has been very cold towards me. She's friends with most of the people we go out with but for some reason she doesn't like me at all.\n\nCut to this day, I've now unblocked Jasmine. She hasn't sent me anything, and I haven't sent her anything. My plan was to keep her blocked for the days she was in the cottage party so I wouldn't get bombarded with bullying from people who have nothing to do with this, and to generally just cool off. Now I'm not sure if I want to continue our friendship but I would like at least end in good term, since I don't enjoy being gossiped about. Jasmine can be a little manipulative. Before the fight happened, she told me that I was one of her closest and dearest friends, but this only made me feel like she wanted me to just agree with her on everything and not give my opinion. The fact that she called me difficult when I express that I was disappointed and insulted by her actions, yeah in a very unproductive way, made me feel used.\n\nI'm planning on apologizing for starting this fight and cursing her out, but also telling her that I'm not backing out of my opinion that ghosting is not okay and she should have told us that she's not coming. My feelings and my time should be respected and if requesting that makes me a difficult person that I'm sorry but this friendship can no longer continue.\n\nHow long should I wait to talk to her? Some people say I should have messaged her immediately, some say I should wait longer. I don't want to fight with her. \nI'm also very scared to tell her that I want to be respected and that she has insulted me. I'm scared she would start to bully me and spread lies about me everywhere like those girls in my middle school and high school. Also the whole obsessed thing is really insulting to me. I don't believe I'm obsessed when I get invited out, but I don't want people think that about me. This whole situation is making me very insecure.\n\nWhen should I send a message to Jasmine? Should I message Belle also? Or do I just never ever ever speak to these people again, and just move on? Is this worth it?\n\nNeed some god of friendships level of advice here.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

While he was looking something up (in reference to what we were watching), a text came in and I\u2019m guessing out of habit he tapped to check it.\n\nProblem was, that opened up a conversation with his friend where he was venting about me and how boring and disappointing the hangout was. He referred to me as a derogatory term in the messages as well. I saw only a couple messages until he closed the screen but it was enough to make me feel sick to my stomach.\n\nI left, and later confronted him about what I saw. He apologized and attempted to explain the texts (how he speaks specifically to that friend, why he was texting that stuff, etc) and said that he values our friendship.\n\nBut I\u2019m having trouble getting past this. Our friendship has its ups and downs but we\u2019ve been getting better at communicating and working through the issues. This feels particularly hurtful because I was at a point where I felt comfortable enough to be myself when we hung out, so I didn\u2019t put on a facade of being full of energy - I went over in comfy jeans, no makeup, and was looking forward to a nice chill movie night. So to read that I was a disappointment for being tired and making the night lame felt like a personal attack because I was being genuine around him. \n\nAm I being unreasonable by finding this hard to move past? I\u2019ve vented to my own friends before when I haven\u2019t had a great time somewhere.

I think she thinks I'm trying to hook up with her boyfriend. Let me paint you a picture.\nA couple days ago, my friend asked me if I wanted to go drinking with her. I said sure, there was some sort of deal going on on Mondays. So yesterday, I tried to call her boyfriend, since she is a horrible texter, but he didn't answer. So I sent her a text anyways and she responded with a nope on the drinks. Which was totally fine. I decided to bike to the store to get some beer for dinner instead. I ended up crashing into a car and falling...pretty badly. I tried to call her for help but she didn't answer. I got help from my other friend in the end.\nNow this morning, she sent me a text why I had called her boyfriend instead of her. Accusing me that I didn't tell her about my bike crash and waited hours before calling her. Now the confusing part is, that I took a pain killer to help me and passed out pretty early. I don't actually remember most of the evening. So I told her the truth, she's not a very good texter and I needed help. She didn't believe me and told me it made her uncomfortable to call him. (the problem was that I got my timelines mixed up. I thought I was calling him for help, turns out it was really about all of us going for drinks) So I was defending myself for the wrong situation. Total mix up. When I went to take a screen shot of the situation to prove my innocence, I realized I had everything mixed up. I apologized to her, saying I mixed things up. I thought I had called him for help, but I didn't. She thought I was hiding something. I apologized over and over again, but she still accused me of lying. I told her that if she thought I was trying to move in on her BF, that was completely wrong. In reality, I'm trying to get with her BF's roommate. She still doesn't believe me.

At least that is how I feel.\n\nThe demise of this friendship is essentially because I feel like my friend used me. Every single day, she'd send me recordings, some thirty minutes long, multiple per day, talking all about her problems, her emotions, why she was sad. She'd call me only to launch into her problems. \n\nI couldn't remember the last time she even started our conversation with a \"hey how are you!\". \n\nI can't begin to explain to you how draining this was. All of this going on while things have been a little difficult for me too. But I've always considered myself a trooper, never one to offload on other people, fight my own battles and be there to help my friends.\n\nI got given advice to pull back from her ever so slightly. I even told her i was going through some difficulties myself. So that's what I did and clearly I offended her because she far more distant now. She ignored a message I sent her this weekend (which was a reply to something she sent me) and clearly because the message was not all about her she can't be bothered to reply.\n\nI knew what I was getting myself when I pulled back, and even now I stand by my actions because she wasn't being a true friend. However it still hurts to lose a friend.\n\nThanks", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

During the winter we \"discussed\" (more like suggested and then decided it will happen even though I didn't agree or want) how we should go to Z's college town which is a tourist attraction either way but for me (F 20) and M (19/20) is a 1 hour flight with an airplane and costs 186 Euros or go on a ship for 18 to 24 hours and costs 200 Euros and then we have the costs of living there. Then when I recommended visiting my old town where after an earthquake the town has suffered economically and the costs of hotels and getting there were less than 100 euros it was 68 Euros the airplane ticket for 36 mins of flight and then 86 Euros the two nights at a hotel plus we wouldn't need tour guides since I lived there for five years and I know the town like the back of my hand plus I would get them to meet my childhood best friend Polly and her sister. Yet the moment they heard that the town since 2009 has been a hot spot for immigrants freaked them out and started, as usual, being racists towards immigrants which is ironic since all three of us at least one ancestor of ours had been an immigrant; mine my maternal grandpa's family left Eastern Thrace (Now European part of Turkey) in the 1920s, Z's great grandma with her grandma arrived here from Smyrna in 1912 and M's entire paternal side came from Eastern Roumelia (Now Bulgaria) in 1914 because of wars yet they act high and mighty! \n\nI told them how hypocritical it was of them to say vile things like that and they didn't speak to me for days!\n\nThen when they finally spoke to me Z said how she couldn't wait until we get to come to her college town! When I told her I wasn't economically able to even purchase the ticket or have money to live there if I made the trip they said that they could help me but I kindly declined.\n\nAt the same time, my family has been going through a very dark time economically wise and the past year I have been searching for a job! So much that my family told me that in the summer I will need to find a job because they can't support me anymore and I need to help them too because my little sister in three years from now she'll need money too like I did when she goes to college. So, I submitted my reseme as a salesperson and I'm waiting to see if they'll hire me and if they do I have to work year around not just in the summer part time of course.\n\nThen I have to think of my residency because I almost graduated from college.\n\nDuring Easter when we met I asked them if they would have liked to go to my grand-aunt's house in my grandma's hometown where the sea is close by, it's a small town and most of all everything is cheap, I know the town and we have a house so we don't have to pay for a hotel it's a bigger house than Z's so we won't have a problem with being in each other's hairs all the time resulting in fights unlike how we all have been if we had gone to Z's or in my old hometown.\n\nBut again they said NO! My grandma's home town would just cost them 35 Euros and 7 hours of a bus ride for Christ's sake!\n\nThen we haven't talked about it since then a couple of weeks ago Z suddenly said that she has someone who is a friend with someone who owns summer resorts an hour away from my college town and that it costs 80 euros per night and that we should stay for 4 days meaning 200 Euros not counting the expenses of eating... And kept going on and on about how awesome it will be! I kept telling them I didn't know if I could handle it money wise and they kept saying they would help me...then I learned that my family wouldn't be able to support me anymore past this year and I need to find a job immediately.\n\nM has a job, she also gets paid by the government for her graduating thesis/experiment on crops and her family is well off and also gets paid to help her parents with their land so she has the money!\n\nZ gets money from her parents and she some times gets paid to draw on walls and glasses of coffee shops when holidays come around, so she saves up.\n\nI had a pretty difficult time finding a job either online or in real life because of having no experience. So, I'm penniless.\n\nAnd suddenly I'm told by my parents that not only I have to go with them to my grandma's hometown to take care of some legal stuff that my grandma left undone after she died two years ago and they need me not only as a witness but because my mum has a disability in her legs she needs all the help she can get. (As always but I don't mind that) I asked them when I'm supposed to be there and for how long and they said for an entire month.\n\nZ wants to go around July or August and when I told them about what my parents asked of me and they kept whining and begging me (literally doing that! Not kidding!) not to go with them and to tell them I don't want to. I kept explaining to them that I need to be in court, that my mum's disability can't be handled by just my dad and sister, that I have no money and I need to work in the summer if I find anything! They kept insisting.\n\nThen suddenly when one day we were talking about what we plan on doing in the future and suddenly Z and M said that we didn't have to discuss it since we all going to rent an apartment and live together.\n\nMy plans for the future doesn't include living with them! I promise to my parents that I will try to move abroad and work and then help my sister get a job abroad too in order to help our family because there is no future in my country yet I never told them because whenever we start to talk about the economic state of our country and moving abroad, becoming immigrants, and as usual they become so patriotic it's down-right  racist and how people who seek job opportunities outside of one's country are weak and abandoning their country. \n\nAnd a couple of hours ago I came up with the idea that we can spend at least 2 days together in my college town once Z returns from her college town and then return all of us home as a way to make it up to them for not joining them in the holiday resort an hour away. And once I texted that idea and M's answer was to go fuck myself!\n\nThen Z's answer was that she will come in July and with a friend and since my family and I need to go to my grandma's hometown either in July or August not sure yet and she says that since I'm supposedly going in July and I'll be back in August and that I should tell them when so we can close a resort for 4 days and not to mind about the economic thing!\n\nWHILE I TOLD THEM I CAN'T GO!\n\nThey keep insisting and I don't know how to say it otherwise without sounding a bitch. I need help with ideas about new ways to get them to understand that I can't go! So, what should I tell them?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I wouldn't call myself a huge anime guy but I've watched a few of them (Naruto, DBZ, AoT, MHA). I often enjoy chill music like Mac DeMarco, Vacations, Lofi, Classic Rock, and the occasional Ski-Mask ;) My humor is kind of dark mixed with irony and I'm overall kind of a non-PC type of person. I guess I'm liberal when it comes to the spectrum but have quite the offensive humor. If you are interested in talking to me or have any questions, PM your discord and we can hopefully become friends :)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Very poofy dragons and turtles that look like they're made out of marshmallows. Do you think old time-y people really believed someone lived up there? I feel like a person standing on top of billowing pure white fluff would be noticeable - unless they were shy I guess. Can you imagine if the sky was just an illusion, and it's just a bunch of giant red eyes watching us\n\n\nSo halfway through that shroom induced nightmare fuel I realized I really need more people to talk to, hopefully people I can go out with, but I am totally a-okay with online relationships. I don't want to know your gender or your sex or your ethnicity, well I mean, I won't like flip a table or anything haha, i just mean I want to get to know you as a person before I get to know the shallower stuff. Tell me about your happiest days on earth, or something you really struggle a lot with, or something that's worrying or stressing you out literally right this second. Though I'd like you to be between 18 - 25, I'm 21, I'd just feel a little weird talking to someone super older than me.\nI'm super into writing, I haven't had a lot of time because of school, but lately I have been killing it. Is it egotistical to laugh at stuff you've written? Donald glover said people who are entertainers can't enjoy their own work, but caling myself an entertainer makes me feel like I strip on the side or something. I've also been getting into a whole bunch of books (King killer chronicles, Farseer trilogies, Dresden files, and now Game of Thrones) and I have binged an amazing amount of tv these last few weeks, usually while writing.\n\n\nI cook a lot in my spare time, but man do results vary. When I was a kid I'd make the randomest shit. My mum was an amazing cook, and my dad was on the side making victor von frankenstien jelly with his weird food experiments. Guess which one I learned from!!! Hint: I made coffee flavored jelly two weeks ago to put into my iced coffee. I like to sing and play ukulele, but I'm horrible at both and my neighbours hate me for it.\n\n\nI'm really just looking for people with a lot of free time, who can keep up with me and feel as if they can type (at least the amount I've typed out in this post) when they're responding to me. Like just show interest and ask questions, don't make this like a weird hostage scenario where I'm pincer-ing answers out of you. I can be really talkative, but when the other person doesn't contribute, or types back less than a third of what I did, it feels like I'm forcing you to do it.\n\n\nSo yeah! Drop me a message ! Hope to hear back from you, also definitely mention if you live in Toronto or near Scarborough, cause I'll be psyched about that. It'd be cool if we could make like a group\n\n\nEDIT** Guys I don't actually do shrooms i just meant it as a metaphor haha", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I am here strictly to vent and hopefully find someone who can relate. I have this friend.. we will call her \u201cDiddy\u201d. See now, Diddy and I became friends last year and so far it\u2019s been a rollercoaster. I am a giving person. I like to make others happy. I will legitimately do anything I can for anyone so they do not have to go without. This could be my downfall and I can accept that. Maybe I need to just say \u201cf*^%\u201d it and let people find their own way in life. Anyways. Diddy always asks me for advice. Relationship, job, money etc. and I honestly do give advice to the best of my ability however she never takes it or listens to it. My theory is this person just likes to talk about them and get advice so she can feel \u201cbetter\u201d in the moment. But this continues on and on for weeks. Finally I did tell her I have nothing left to give. No more advice. However I am still a listening ear for her when she needs it I just no longer will give my advice. Yet here we are she keeps asking. Not only that but we have had more ups and down then I can even say I have had. Recently my nicknames of endearment have made her uncomfortable and she has asked me to stop.. which I obliged. I love joking around with this person we have great laughs and memories but she is legitimately sucking all my energy out right now. Everything is on her time. She asks to hang and I say sure and 3 hours later she finally decides to show up. What if I was busy in 3 hours? Who knows what I have planned but it never seems to matter to this person because when I tell her I\u2019m going to bed I still need to talk to her for another hour before she will even consider letting me go to bed. \n\nMy reasoning for this is basically maybe get advice of my own on how to go about a friendship like this one. To see if anyone else has been through this. And the big one is just to vent. I thought having friends again (went a long time without friends) was going to be great but I feel people just use me because I\u2019m too nice. I can have my moments but I don\u2019t like hurting people\u2019s feelings and I\u2019m not great at communication when it comes to my needs.\n\nI would love to talk to someone, anyone about anything it doesn\u2019t even have to be about this. We can just talk about sunsets. I just need some nice conversationalist in my life who don\u2019t ask for much. \n\nThanks!", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Thank you for reading in advance. \nI celebrated a milestone birthday, one that I will admit I had been looking forward to for some time. I started planning quite a while in advance, asked friends and family to come a couple months before so that I would be able to plan better (I work in a different country so time would be short when I returned). I was paying for food etc, people just had to come:dressed for the theme if they wanted, have a good meal and have fun. Specific food requests were made, I was happy to make adjustments so that everyone could enjoy and it all seemed to be going to plan. \n\nThe day came and we spent most of it decorating and cooking (I have an amazing mother who helped me make the majority of the food), everything seemed to be going well. The time came for guests to arrive and just a little over half arrived within the time they had stated. \n\nThe problem, and the reason for this post came when one of my close friends arrived a little late (they had warned me they would be late and I appreciated the heads up), they also told me that two of our group (a married couple) would not be coming because one was not feeling well, one other would be coming much later because they decided they wanted to hang out with their partner. \n\nAll three individuals have my phone number, all three could have contacted me at any point during the day to tell me this, but instead they waited until everything was underway and through another source. I admit, I was hurt. The third friend did eventually pitch, midway through supper and decided to bring their partner (who was not invited and I did not know....the partner at least understood how rude this was and apparently words were had) along. \n\nI guess my issue is these people are supposedly my friends, they know how I am about a.

During the winter we \"discussed\" (more like suggested and then decided it will happen even though I didn't agree or want) how we should go to Z's college town which is a tourist attraction either way but for me (F 20) and M (19/20) is a 1 hour flight with an airplane and costs 186 Euros or go on a ship for 18 to 24 hours and costs 200 Euros and then we have the costs of living there. Then when I recommended visiting my old town where after an earthquake the town has suffered economically and the costs of hotels and getting there were less than 100 euros it was 68 Euros the airplane ticket for 36 mins of flight and then 86 Euros the two nights at a hotel plus we wouldn't need tour guides since I lived there for five years and I know the town like the back of my hand plus I would get them to meet my childhood best friend Polly and her sister. Yet the moment they heard that the town since 2009 has been a hot spot for immigrants freaked them out and started, as usual, being racists towards immigrants which is ironic since all three of us at least one ancestor of ours had been an immigrant; mine my maternal grandpa's family left Eastern Thrace (Now European part of Turkey) in the 1920s, Z's great grandma with her grandma arrived here from Smyrna in 1912 and M's entire paternal side came from Eastern Roumelia (Now Bulgaria) in 1914 because of wars yet they act high and mighty! \n\nI told them how hypocritical it was of them to say vile things like that and they didn't speak to me for days!\n\nThen when they finally spoke to me Z said how she couldn't wait until we get to come to her college town! When I told her I wasn't economically able to even purchase the ticket or have money to live there if I made the trip they said that they could help me but I kindly declined.\n\nAt the same time, my family has been going through a very dark time economically wise and the past year I have been searching for a job! So much that my family told me that in the summer I will need to find a job because they can't support me anymore and I need to help them too because my little sister in three years from now she'll need money too like I did when she goes to college. So, I submitted my reseme as a salesperson and I'm waiting to see if they'll hire me and if they do I have to work year around not just in the summer part time of course.\n\nThen I have to think of my residency because I almost graduated from college.\n\nDuring Easter when we met I asked them if they would have liked to go to my grand-aunt's house in my grandma's hometown where the sea is close by, it's a small town and most of all everything is cheap, I know the town and we have a house so we don't have to pay for a hotel it's a bigger house than Z's so we won't have a problem with being in each other's hairs all the time resulting in fights unlike how we all have been if we had gone to Z's or in my old hometown.\n\nBut again they said NO! My grandma's home town would just cost them 35 Euros and 7 hours of a bus ride for Christ's sake!\n\nThen we haven't talked about it since then a couple of weeks ago Z suddenly said that she has someone who is a friend with someone who owns summer resorts an hour away from my college town and that it costs 80 euros per night and that we should stay for 4 days meaning 200 Euros not counting the expenses of eating... And kept going on and on about how awesome it will be! I kept telling them I didn't know if I could handle it money wise and they kept saying they would help me...then I learned that my family wouldn't be able to support me anymore past this year and I need to find a job immediately.\n\nM has a job, she also gets paid by the government for her graduating thesis/experiment on crops and her family is well off and also gets paid to help her parents with their land so she has the money!\n\nZ gets money from her parents and she some times gets paid to draw on walls and glasses of coffee shops when holidays come around, so she saves up.\n\nI had a pretty difficult time finding a job either online or in real life because of having no experience. So, I'm penniless.\n\nAnd suddenly I'm told by my parents that not only I have to go with them to my grandma's hometown to take care of some legal stuff that my grandma left undone after she died two years ago and they need me not only as a witness but because my mum has a disability in her legs she needs all the help she can get. (As always but I don't mind that) I asked them when I'm supposed to be there and for how long and they said for an entire month.\n\nZ wants to go around July or August and when I told them about what my parents asked of me and they kept whining and begging me (literally doing that! Not kidding!) not to go with them and to tell them I don't want to. I kept explaining to them that I need to be in court, that my mum's disability can't be handled by just my dad and sister, that I have no money and I need to work in the summer if I find anything! They kept insisting.\n\nThen suddenly when one day we were talking about what we plan on doing in the future and suddenly Z and M said that we didn't have to discuss it since we all going to rent an apartment and live together.\n\nMy plans for the future doesn't include living with them! I promise to my parents that I will try to move abroad and work and then help my sister get a job abroad too in order to help our family because there is no future in my country yet I never told them because whenever we start to talk about the economic state of our country and moving abroad, becoming immigrants, and as usual they become so patriotic it's down-right  racist and how people who seek job opportunities outside of one's country are weak and abandoning their country. \n\nAnd a couple of hours ago I came up with the idea that we can spend at least 2 days together in my college town once Z returns from her college town and then return all of us home as a way to make it up to them for not joining them in the holiday resort an hour away. And once I texted that idea and M's answer was to go fuck myself!\n\nThen Z's answer was that she will come in July and with a friend and since my family and I need to go to my grandma's hometown either in July or August not sure yet and she says that since I'm supposedly going in July and I'll be back in August and that I should tell them when so we can close a resort for 4 days and not to mind about the economic thing!\n\nWHILE I TOLD THEM I CAN'T GO!\n\nThey keep insisting and I don't know how to say it otherwise without sounding a bitch. I need help with ideas about new ways to get them to understand that I can't go! So, what should I tell them?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I don\u2019t know how to do introductions, so I\u2019m just going to get into it.\n\nI have never told anyone about my true feelings because of this whole trend of being depressed. The people I hang out with would make fun of people who said they where depressed and wanted to kill them selves. (Well get back to them later) so I just lived my life only crying and expressing my feelings to a book I wrote in. I have nobody to talk to as my parents don\u2019t understand and I have no friends that I trust or I think care about me enough to actually help me. I also believed that I wasn\u2019t depressed or have anxiety and that I was just nervous and sad sometimes. Because of all these people on the internet and in real life saying they are depressed when they aren\u2019t. I felt like nobody would take me seriously.\n\n(This next part gets a little off topic, I would just like you to know how bad my parents are)\n Let me get this out of the way- my parents are overwhelmingly Christian and homophobic. I have not told them, and after recent conversations I believe I will never tell them, that I am an atheist and asexual. I\u2019ve heard them talk about how gay people don\u2019t deserve a moth and that they shouldn\u2019t even have a day. I had to leave the room and go eat my breakfast in my moms office. My mom also believes she knows everything about me. My birthday is coming up, (July 14th) and this year I mostly asked for clothes and cosplay stuff. I was very specific because every birthday and Christmas before this has been a bust with gifts I don\u2019t like and never use. She believes that I can\u2019t be depressed because I\u2019m just a child. When she was a kid, she did have depression and tried to kill herself with overdose. But if you had a conversation with her if you where an atheist and worst of all she didn\u2019t know it would be you getting sick of her saying things about god and nowadays I think that\u2019s all she cares about. Around 10 years ago she married my step-dad after my dad died. He is nothing but verbally abusive and bipolar. He would freak out and start screaming at you if you left a napkin on the counter. My mom once said while in a car ride with one of her sisters that she regrets even marrying him. But refuses to divorce for some reason. My step dad is has a lot of money because he is a cheap skate. Almost everything In my room was taken from someone else\u2019s trash. My desk, best and and drawers where all bought from this guy around 8 years ago and they are really bad. The handles have already fallen off of all of them, there are stains that are permanently stuck in the desk. All three pieces of furniture are sticky, and attract ants. (I have a phobia of ants) I told my dad why I needed his measuring tape to get measurements to see if the desk I like would fit in my room and he yelled at me saying things like, you\u2019re the reason this desk is bad, this desk is still fine you can use it, I\u2019m the one who bought it and spray painted it for you, you should be grateful. I cried after that. Im actually looking to re-do my entire room because it\u2019s always dirty, the colors are ugly and every time I look at it I just feel sad. I\u2019ve started re-doing my room but I really can\u2019t do anything without money. I am under the age of 16, and I don\u2019t have a job to make money, so I ask my parents for help. My dad is not on board and my mom says she doesn\u2019t have bough money. My mom works as a respiratory therapist and makes around 35 dollars an hour. See: 300 dollars a day give or take. My step dad is unemployed but receives disability checks from the government. So far, he has gotten me nothing for my birthday and believes everything I\u2019ve put on my list is too expensive. \nI\u2019ve talked enough about my parents back to the actual topic (I\u2019m sorry)\n\nLast year I had this group of friends that consisted of three people. I\u2019ll call them Shaun, Kyle, and Grant. (Not their real names) I am the only girl in this friend group. And really I wasn\u2019t even a friend. So grant was very annoying in the start of the year and we would bully him because he was annoying halfway through the year, he stopped hanging out with us and got better at being not annoying. I became friends with him later. Now Shaun and Kyle where we\u2019ll know in my class and grade for that matter as he funny ones. Both of them had loads of friends and were considered hilarious. I was friends with Shaun for around 4 years now. So naturally being put in the same class as him I hung out with him more. I was alway the odd one out in the group, because Shaun would say something and everybody would laugh but as soon as I said it it wasn\u2019t funny anymore. I was never included in the friend group and never got any of there jokes because they had a weird sense of humor. But not weird like quirky, weird like, extremely offensive. Both of them, even Shaun, who was white, would say the n-word. Not just as a one time thing hey would say it casually multiple times everyday and use it as a word to make fun of people. They got in trouble, and I ended up getting in trouble with them and they still never learned their lesson. The things they would make fun of where horrible. They made fun of our principals dead son, our teachers dead husband who died from cancer nonetheless, my dead pet, and would often make fun of me as a person and call me ugly and gross and when I\u2019d arrive at the lunch table the would start shouting ew gross get away at me and then say it was joke.\nLater in the year, Kyle started hating me. I have no idea why to this day and people say it\u2019s because I gave him he fear of hands. 1. I said I was sorry and deeply apologized 2. He started hating my guts way Before that. He would make remarks that made me feel horrible. They where the only friends I had and they made me cry so many times. At the end of he year I tried to talk to them about it on the bus home from our field trip to busch gardens. Shaun was the only one there and I tried to tell him because I believed he could be serious and take me seriously because he said he could but he didn\u2019t. He lied to me saying he could take me seriously and then made me cry on a bus with 11 people on it and the next day we went back to school and they continued to hurt my feelings until the school year ended. \n\nI\u2019m stopping this here because I\u2019ve gone off topic too much and I\u2019m just not good at expressing how bad the situations actually is.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

How in love they were but while I was deployed she emailed me they had broken up for his failure to commit and she was deeply depressed (she has a history of mental health issues).  Not long after she met a co-worker and started dating him.  He was an alcoholic and verbally abused her which triggered her depression even more.  Along with the numerous crap things he did to her, I was lucky enough to listen to every single grievance. I told her to leave him, he didn\u2019t have his stuff together and she shouldn\u2019t be with someone who treated her badly.  She didn\u2019t listen, ended up getting pregnant by him 3 months into their relationship.  I told her that I didn\u2019t want to hear about him if she was going to still try to make it work with him but wanted to support her in any way.  She said, so you don\u2019t want to hear about the baby?\u201d  DEF not what I said.  She constantly posts status updates now about how \u201cuseless/sad/unworthy/disappointed\u201d she is to be here.  I reached out and said she should speak to a professional about it and she kind of just said, yeah I\u2019m seeing someone soon.  She recently posted about how she has to BEG people to be around her.  I don\u2019t feel bad because I work 12-18 hour days, have a toddler, am transitioning out of the military and I\u2019m not apologizing for being a busy adult but now I find myself less and less interested in finding time to coddle her.

I have been on holiday with my friend for the past month in Europe and every time we go out to bars and clubs she almost blacks out every time. It\u2019s just us two on holiday, however as someone who doesn\u2019t drink much at all I have to babysit her every time we are out. When she drinks she doesn\u2019t know when to stop although she claims she knows what she\u2019s doing. She will average 6 men a night that she\u2019ll hook up with at the club, about 10-12 drinks over a few hours (hard to calculate with pitchers) and she puts herself into danger by climbing on surfaces and falling over all the time. \n\nFor instance last night it took me 3 hours to have her go back to the hotel so we can sleep. I had to tell bartenders not to pour her anymore drinks as people were staring at her embarrassing herself. When I told her we have to go because it was very late in the morning and we are in a foreign country with phones that don\u2019t work (Damn SIM cards) she says \u201cyou can go home, I\u2019ll stay here, I\u2019m not done having fun\u201d. Despite grabbing her arm she would say \u201cf*** off I\u2019m having fun\u201d while I stand by myself in the club borderline anxiety attack as she is doing much more than kissing in the corner of the club. Eventually she came back to the hotel with the man she was with because I asked if he wanted to go back with her. The receptionist kicked both of them out for drunkenness and no guest policy while I was getting ready for bed upstairs. One panic attack later, her location noted that she was across the island at this man\u2019s hotel. \n\nMy friends outside of my friend group ask me how we are even friends to begin with. We\u2019ve known each other since we were 4 yrs old. She\u2019s very much about partying and her image on social media while I like to stay in with my boyfriend or watch movies, wine nights with my other friends. My bf and friends believe our friendship is becoming toxic and actually dangerous because she is inconsiderate of my feelings. She does only care about herself. I just find it so scary because we aren\u2019t even in our home country. \n\nMy worry is that I am not doing enough as a friend to help her in the clubs and bars when she is plastered. No matter what I do to help she screams at me and condones me the next day when she\u2019s sober saying to not tell her when to do when she drinks. This makes me upset as she always puts the both of us in danger. I can\u2019t even describe how scary our walk home was last night. Being approached my strangers and her wanting to make out with random men as we pass them on the street. No matter what I say she turns the conversation around and points to my insecurities saying things like \u201coh you\u2019re ruining my fun bc you don\u2019t drink\u201d or \u201cyou should break up with your bf and learn to have fun. What should I do?\n\nTDLR; I have a friend who is an inconsiderate drunk every time we go out. She puts herself and myself into danger all the time.

We have had a long history (the leaders) and have come away with several relationships that have lasted a long time. Most of us just chat when we have time and want to talk, and we talk about various things. Some subjects that come to mind: banter, our daily lives, politics, and real world stuff in general. We are all very diverse of interest, and all of us are active (we remove inactive people, who don't invest time.) I would say we have a good split of US and EU people, as well as a nice spot of Australians/SEA , and also Men/Woman ratio.\n\nWhat we're looking for is genuine people, who want to make long lasting friendships. The type of person who comes in to the chat and interacts with us, not just posts a meme and leave. If you're shy, socially awkward, we get it. We will allow you time to open up, and none of us are very judge-y. If you're coming in to this community, get ready to explore a world of genuine people with real thoughts and feelings, this is not a meme fest, although it can be. We have several channels and topics of discussions going on, and we're quite active as a rule - politics, not safe, selfies, introductions etc. Introducing yourself and showing yourself are highly encouraged, though not mandatory.\n\nIdeally you will be:\n\n\\- Honest (I do not want meme personalities or personas here. If you have crippling depression we get it, but be yourself.)\n\n\\- Interactive\n\n\\- Willing to voice chat sometimes or be very text-active\n\n\\- Authentic\n\n\\- Be looking for real friends from real people\n\n\\- An adult\n\nThis community is based on that, community - it's not a chat room. We're cultivating friendship, working on talking to each other, getting to know each other etc. Personalities will clash, not everyone will like each other and that's fine. The admins are well versed in this kind of situation from experience, and will know what to do about it.\n\nIf you're interested, please drop a message for the link, and leave a bit about yourself (especially your age!)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I had just decided to move back to my parents house a 1.000km away after living alone in another state for nearly 7 years. Just exactly 1 week away from me moving back, me and this girl started talking on Instagram, it turns out she also went back to her parents house and bought a bar in the small town she's from, so we had a lot in common, we quickly fell in love and now 1 year have passed and here we are, officially together for quite some time now, even tho we live so far apart we have manage to see each other a few times, she came over and I also went over there, we make do how we can.\n\nFor like a month now things are not as good as it used to be, the bar the owns is not doing good and she's closing doors, selling all the stuff as she can, on top of that, her grandma is really sick, she's blind, deaf, can't walk and needs attention 24h, she has spent a few nights awake on grandma duty this last weeks. So because of all that, last time we saw each other was at the end of March, 3 months ago, and most of the times I call her she says she's busy, or has someone over or whatever and we can never talk, I miss being close to her.\n\nBut I think the core of the problem is, since I came back to my mom's a year ago now, I haven't been able to find a job, I pretty much spend my days sitting in front of the computer playing games and watching videos, I don't have any money so I don't go out and I have strafed away from the last few friends I had here, I guess I put it upon here all my attention needs sorta, and with all that's going on over there I think she's had enough, but I have asked to go over there and help her many times, to work at the bar for her, to be help her with her grandma, even drive her wherever she needs, she always refuses, she says me being there is gonna be one more thing for her to deal with.\n\nI love her, with all my heart, I really do, I want to make it work, to grow old with her and have kids and live a happy life besides her, that's what I want the most in this world.\n\nToday we started a heavy conversation on text, she kinda put all the things in perspective, she's at work now and she's gonna call me when she gets home so we can talk, I think this is it Reddit, what can I do to show her that we can work and that I'm capable of adapting and making it easy and enjoyable on her?", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I  enjoy going to the library, reading books,planning trips and vacations,  cooking, watching YouTube and listening to Spotify. My top three  favorite foods are Seafood #1, Mexican #2, and Mediterranean #3. I also  enjoy sports specifically football and basketball. My favorite teams are  the Philadelphia Eagles, Oklahoma Sooners and Kansas Jayhawks  basketball. I currently am not working as a result of severe depression  and anxiety. There is more to the story than that which I would be  willing to discuss openly.  \nI really enjoy writing and have been  writing short stories all of my life. In fact I enjoy writing so much  that I would happily write a story for you with characters of your  choice! I will post below one of my short stories so you can get a taste  as to how I write. I am also someone who gets heavily invested with  people. Having superficial friendships is hard for me to maintain and  thus I tend to have a smaller group of friends but they tend to be  deeper and long lasting. Anyways, suppose I shouldn\u2019t give everything  away but to inspire you I\u2019ll leave a few questions you could answer to  get the conversation going if you are interested. Hope to hear from you  soon.\n\n* What is your favorite color?\n* What do you do to keep busy?\n* What is your mood right now?\n* What are some annoying questions people ask you?\n* What quirks do you have?\n* What do you spend the most time thinking about?\n* What are some of the events in your life that made you who you are?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Riddles in the Dark**\n\nThe water was refreshing his palate as Thomas drank from his stainless-steel  \ntumbler. His work phone had rang with such frequency that Thomas had to shut it  \noff completely and have his secretary Amanda Miller cancel any scheduled  \nmeetings for the day and if they were unavoidable to send Madeleine to them  \ninstead. Instinctively, Thomas took two valium and leaned back in his chair as  \nhe watched the news report on his computer. He was being considered a primary  \nsuspect in the death of Joanna Meyers, one of his top scientists in R&amp;D.  \nShe had been employed with his company for five years and had quickly become  \none of his most valuable employees. Joanna fit the bill of exactly how Thomas  \nliked his personal staff to be: tall, curvaceous and quick to follow commands.\n\nWhile Thomas had his fair share of male employees, he made a point to place women in  \nhigher level positions or ones where he would have frequent contact. From a  \npublic relations perspective, Nebula One Corporation was championed as a  \nprogressive company which hired and promoted employees based on merit and not  \non their gender or through nepotism. Privately, Thomas enjoyed having faithful  \nand trustworthy women surrounding him who wore outfits that pleased him and  \nnever hesitated to fulfill whatever he needed done. Joanna, however, had  \nrecently overstepped her boundaries and was going beyond her purview as an  \nattractive stewardess for a strong and virile billionaire. The incident in the  \nstairwell had come unexpectedly, thanks to a tip provided by his security team.  \n \n\nHis thoughts were broken up by the entrance of Madeleine Olivier stepping into his  \noffice and closing the door behind her. There was a limited number of people  \nwho could enter into his office without being escorted by his secretary and  \nMadeleine was one of them. Madeleine\u2019s question about Joanna struck Thomas as  \ncoming from a place of confusion, rather than being presented with an  \naccusatory tone. Thomas stood up from the desk and buttoned his three-piece  \nsuit before going over and locking the office door behind her. He then walked  \nto his office phone and instructed Amanda that he would not be receiving anyone  \nunless they were law enforcement or his attorney.\n\nOnce the order was given, Thomas gestured for Madeleine to join him by two leather  \ncouches which sat next to an enormous picture window which looked out over Los  \nAngeles County. Between the couches was a glass table which had a Ferrari V12  \nEngine as its base. The table held various reading materials, ranging from the  \n\\*Wall Street Journal\\* to \\*The Economist.\\* He sat down on the couch to the right  \nof the door and Madeleine sat down opposite him. Unbuttoning his suit, Thomas  \nleaned back and crossed one leg over the other to reveal purple and white socks  \nwhich matched his grey suit with purple accents.  \n \n\n\u201cUnfortunately,what you have heard is true. Joanna has indeed died. Quite a terrible thing  \nthat happened to her. I decided to take the stairs to the lower level to check  \non research with the Mark IV synthetic weave and found Joanna at the bottom of  \nthe stairwell with blood pooled around her head. It was a gruesome sight.  \nGhastly, really.\u201d  \n \n\nThomas shook his head as he folded his hands together over his knee and stared  \nabsentmindedly at the glass table for several moments. Keeping his composure  \nwas paramount, for Thomas had no intention of stepping into dramatics so  \nrecently after the event. He had already worked through being offended by the  \n$1 million bail set by Judge Kennedy, arguing that such a high price presumed  \nhis guilt, even though $1 million was pocket change for Thomas.  \nIncessant newspapers and journalists had been aggravating Thomas and his HR department  \nnonstop which did nothing to help his mood. Sitting down with Madeleine,  \nhowever, brought a sense of calm that Thomas had not expected. Madeleine was a  \nloyal and hard-working assistant who had no equal at NOC. Without her, Thomas\u2019s  \ncorporation would run at a fifth of the efficiency that it did under her care.  \nNow, however, Madeleine was going to be challenged with her biggest task yet  \nand Thomas hoped she would be up to the task.  \n \n\n\u201cSo,  what are the other employees saying about me out there? That I am a murderer, a  \ncold-blooded killer who attacked a white woman or so the stereotype goes for  \nblack men, am I right? Even though my mother is as white as they come and my  \ndad is mixed himself.\u201d", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I, especially if I was  able bodied and wealthy, probably wouldn't marry a woman in a similar  position.\n\nI've  understood and embraced my condition, but it doesn't make it feel  better. At least with the incel community I had a group of similar  experience. Well I have been rejected by them now. I have a hard time  here in the mid-west to find identity.

I\u2019ve made some really meaningful online friendships, but they always tend to drift off, which is fine. I\u2019ll talk to anyone but I tend to be more comfortable with and connect better with women because I was almost exclusively raised by them. No nsfw, not necessarily interested in an online or LDR, just looking for someone to relate to and talk about stuff we like, don\u2019t like, how your day was, how you\u2019re feeling, etc. I\u2019m usually an almost instant responder, won\u2019t ever get annoyed with talking too much or about uncomfortable stuff, an open book with a lot of interesting stories, if nothing else I can serve as a temporary distraction from incessant boredom and existential dread.\n\nI play PC and PS4, love to build/work on computers, watch way too much TV (Futurama, The Office, The Good Place, Dr. Who, It\u2019s Always Sunny), enjoy almost all kinds of music, and attempt to write poetry, which I will ask you to read at some point. \n\nI\u2019ve dealt with depression and suicidal ideations for almost my entire life. I don\u2019t mind talking about the bad parts of life, but I don\u2019t like to stew in misery, either.

I want to connect with people and do whatever I can to help them become the best versions of themselves. \n\nIf there are any faults they are probably these: I talk too much usually. Not only am I ok with finding a randomly text throughout the day friend, it\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m desperately missing from my life right now. But, once they are clearly established, I can respect boundaries. I can be too open and overwhelming sometimes. I\u2019m not always great at keeping up, but that\u2019s because I have a very low opinion of myself and usually either think I\u2019m just bugging the person or honestly usually that they only talk to me because they think I\u2019m pathetic and fun to laugh at, so I should wait until they want the entertainment.

We had been best friends since pre-k, our friendship ended a year ago last week, I remember, but solely because it was 11 years of friendship in the trash. Our friendship ended because of a boy, the stupidest reason for a friendship to ever end.  Basically I had this crush for about 4 years &amp; we was my best friend, and she knew I liked him. &amp; she would mock me for it saying ew he\u2019s so ugly? Why do you like him, this and that. Then fast forward to last summer, I was dming him &amp; it was such a good conversation that went on for hours . Mind you, he didn\u2019t know I liked him. Then my \u201cbest friend\u201d comes over and she\u2019s like well let me text him and I was like but uh why? because she wanted to do I was like okay it\u2019s fine. It doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019s my best friend and she could already tell I\u2019m uncomfortable with the idea, so nothing will happen. But boy was I wrong, they texted for days and weeks and she would come over as normal never bring him up so I figured they stopped. But then our relationship because rocky, I stopped texting her &amp; vise versa, then he finally (being the actual good friend I had) told me and was honest that they had been dating. But that she didn\u2019t want to tell me until he finally talked to her about it. And this shocked the fuck out of me. Like she lied to me. she literally broke my heart twice, once because she knew I had crushes on him for years &amp; then for lying to me! In my own house! I didn\u2019t talk to her for months! Months! until finally I couldn\u2019t hold it, I missed her so then I unblocked her on all social media\u2019s and we tried talking as if nothing had happened but then it wouldn\u2019t work so then we\u2019d go back to no contact. Fast forward to this summer (now), I miss her. A lot. But I can\u2019t be best friends with her anymore. Our attitudes with each other have changed. It\u2019s fake. Our text message conversations were shit when we tried building up the friendship like 4 times. And she\u2019s been weird about it. She\u2019s made several accounts just to follow me and like my pictures, then proceed to send me pictures of her saying hey boo. like is this her mocking me? actually wanting to reach out? what??", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We have a group text where we all keep in touch and talk almost daily. It\u2019s been 20 years of frequent contact. To the outside world, I am lucky. I am part of a group of 5 women who have maintained a childhood friendship into adulthood. But on the inside, I feel weirdly alone. \n\nThey are all a bit... \u201chipstery\u201d and trendy. They live for Instagram pictures and getting followers. They don\u2019t have deep conversations, they can\u2019t mentally process intense emotions. \n\nBad things have happened to me over the last few years and while they\u2019ve \u201cbeen there\u201d they weren\u2019t a source of relief or comfort. For example, I had a stalker and I was so stressed out that I gained a ton of weight. I asked my friends not to post pictures of me a) for my safety and b) because I was ashamed of how I looked. They still did it anyway. \n\nThey are all also a bit closer to each other than they are to me, I am the more outgoing one - the more loud and outspoken, the most spontaneous one. I am also the only one that doesn\u2019t give a shit about social media because I do it for a job. I think it makes some of them uncomfortable at times even though that\u2019s never been my goal. \n\nBasically, they pay attention to each other because they are \u201ccooler\u201d and more trendy, even when I\u2019ve had the same life events happen to me. For example, I\u2019ve been in two long distance relationships, and my one friend is seen as the only who has ever been in one. They literally forget the events of my life all the time. I lost my job last year, and no one cared, but this year, one of the girls got fired and everyone made a huge deal. When my heart got broken, I got some occasional texts, but whenever another girl gets heartbroken, it\u2019s a huge deal. Two of us are graphic designers - me included- but because I don\u2019t post mine on Instagram, they forget that\u2019s also what I do. \n\nI am 28 and I don\u2019t have many other friends. It\u2019s harder to make friends as an adult too, so I am reluctant to scrap this group altogether, even though I don\u2019t feel like I fit in. When should I just cut my losses?

What is my purpose in life and why am I here? Where am I going? What do I contribute to my surroundings that\u2019s making a difference? If I was gone tomorrow would it change anything? Am I really unique and what do I bring that\u2019s so valuable and different?\n\n\nTo be fair, everybody asks themselves these questions at some point in their lives. More often than not, it\u2019s not just once or it shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s healthy, but then again, if you don\u2019t like to scratch the surface to figure out what\u2019s underneath it might be difficult for you and you may not want to seek the answers. If you focus too much on scratching you might lose sight and get tunnel vision. Yes, it\u2019s a fine line.\n\n\nI\u2019ve never stopped asking myself those questions and I never truly have the answers. It changes all the time and evolves depending on the situations and where I am in my life. What I wanted was to make a difference.\n\n\nWhen I was 7 years old, I\u2019d often have discussions with God \u2013 now relax, this isn\u2019t about religion so don\u2019t freak out. It came from wanting to understand the bigger questions. I\u2019m not sure why He was my go to. I simply felt that He was there, that He somehow could hear me and understand. There was a lot of crying and difficulties understanding the world around me. I felt a disconnect. I felt I didn\u2019t belong. I felt lonely.\n\n\nI wanted to be like Jesus. I wanted to be able to perform miracles and heal people. Why? Did he not have the most meaningful purpose? Obviously, it depends on your beliefs and your religious background. Mine is Catholic. My point, I wanted to have purpose and meaning like him. I wanted to, even from the age of 7, make a difference in the world. That is simply what I wanted to do. To be able to put my hands on someone and make all the pain go away. Hands have deep meaning for me. They can take but they can also give back \u2013 we can talk more about hands in another post.\n\n\nGrowing up, I learned to see and understand the different depths that constitutes relationships. I was able to see that people in general have multiple side to themselves. We all wear masks that helps us navigate through the world. Once I came to understand that, I learned something very important about myself:\n\n\nI did not want to go through life wearing masks and pretending to be something or someone I was not. Especially just to please or to fit a certain box or label.\n\n\nTherefore, at the age of 16, I made a conscious decision to be authentic. To speak my truth and to stand my ground. To stay true to myself and what I believed in. I always was the quiet and shy type. I wanted to be liked, but never gave in to peer pressure. I preferred to stay alone than to be with people who were not able to appreciate me. I was often alone. What made it hard is the fact that wanted to please people around me.\n\n\nSo, what does this all mean and what is my point?\n\n\nIt means engaging in meaningful relationships. People that will accept me at my worst, love me regardless, appreciate my strengths and see the twinkle and light I can bring to their lives.\n\n\nThe profound need to connect with people around me will always be present. Wanting to help, be loved, accepted and seen was not always easy, and still isn\u2019t easy. It has brought me a lot of joy but also a lot of pain. I was fortunate to find good friends along the way, but I have learned that even in friendship connections don\u2019t always last. Saying goodbye has always been painful for me. It\u2019s not always by choice and sometimes I don\u2019t alwaysget to say goodbye.\n\n\nA little analogy if you will:\n\nI have come to the conclusion that I am a port. Ships, vessels and boats may dock for a while, others in passing, but in the end too very few stay for the long hall. Some are not ships, vessels or boats at all. They are actually engineers, technicians, net-workers, dock workers, ground keepers, etc. They have a meaningful purpose for being there. They also help maintain the port, if you will, but when one of them leaves\u2026it leaves a void.\n\n\nLet\u2019s not forget about the Harbor master, the one that knows the port through and through. The one that has seen her at her best and at her worst. What happens when that position vacates? It happens you know, it\u2019s not always a match.\n\n\nHow does one deal with that type of void? How does one deal with the fact that maybe a connection they thought they had really wasn\u2019t a connection? That connection to a certain degree is simply impossible, even after sharing a life time with that person. It\u2019s devastating.\n\n\nI know we cannot predict the future and it\u2019s impossible to know if a person will be in our life forever or in simple passing. If I am lucky and able to establish a connection with that person, letting them see my true self and them letting me see their true self, even if it is for a short period, that relationship/bound/connection will have meant something. It will have left traces in me.\n\n\nIs it safe to assume that in some way I left a piece of myself with them? I sure hope so. I still carry these people in my heart and there are some days where I feel I have more holes than anything.\n\n\nIn the last year, there\u2019s one reoccurring question I am being asked:\n\n\u201cJosie, what is it you want?\u201d\n\n\nSometimes to be able to answer that question, one needs to be able to know what they don\u2019t want. Right? To eliminate the weeds in order to see the gem.\n\n\nIs it possible to want something you\u2019ve never experienced knowing all the value it holds? It is. How? By knowing what a meaningful connection is. By knowing my worth, my wants, my desires. By being myself. By talking the talk and walking the walk. By putting and continuing to put myself out there. The confirmation of it happens with the experience. Hopefully, the boomerang effect will come back to me. Maybe, just maybe, that vacate spot won\u2019t stay vacant for ever.\n\n\nSomeone told me recently: \u201cBe good to yourself, you are the only you those in your world have.\u201d\n\n\nNow, if that\u2019s not having purpose, I don\u2019t know what is. I am here to shine by being Josie. I am going wherever my feet lead and my heart takes me. I give myself entirely to my surrounding and that in itself makes all the difference in the world. If I\u2019m gone tomorrow, it would change everything for them. Because I am unique. I bring value. I make a difference everywhere I go.\n\nI may be a port but I am a moving one.\n\n\nJosie Q.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I struggled for 2yrs to get to this job and my parents didnt give it much of a second glance... I am happy with where I\u2019ve come over two years but I feel like my spirit has just taken a beating over the past couple years and I just need someone to understand because no one seems to care.  I started looking for jobs again after being in my current positon for 6mo.  I have had a couple of hits, but I realy hate the job applying process... it feels so non personal, i have to waste so much of my personal time just to get to a job for more money which I may not even enjoy.\n\nI still live at my parents house while I save money for a year to pay off some loans for college and my car, but I am looked down upon.\n\nI work out 4 times a week, I\u2019ve seen progress in the past 3months and this is one of the few things that has made me feel slightly confident.  I feel like the road us getting steeper though and I\u2019m doing my best to keep my schedule and keep pushing, but it feels like im hitting a wall..\n\nGrowing up I never had a room to myself, we only had 3 rooms for kids and there was 4 of us, so I had to share... I know first world problems, but I aways feel as a middle child I have gotten the axe in fairness...\nA year and a half ago when I was struggling to get a job, my father yelled at me and I hit a really low point in my life.  I finally got a technician job and no one batted an eye even though I was doing 60hrs a week for decent money.  I worked so hard for that year and I was exhausted... and now my father is being nice to me again, but every time I see him I just think of how he yelled at me for being \u201cworthless human being\u201d, and my mother is nice but she is upset with me for still holding a grudge with my father, but truth be told... I\u2019m torn between permanently servering contact with my father, but I know it\u2019s break my mothers heart and I dk how to handle all these frustrations with my family.\nI want to move out, but I would be struggling to keep up financially with loans and what rent would cost, and I\u2019m afraid but also anxious to leave...  why does rent where I live have to cost so much... why do college loans suck so much...\n\nMy job feels less and less interesting by they day, im not utilizing 1% of my skills from college and I have no stimulation.\n\nI\u2019ve never really gone out \u201cdrinking\u201d like on the town, yeah I had a couple beers once a few years back with a couple coworkers... but I just dont know if i want want to be part of that... my brother has shown me the ugly side of drinking with the money he wastes, the stupid things he does... and honestly I\u2019ve never really had someone I have confidence in to go out and have a few drinks with... and at this point it just feels wierd because it feels built into or social system of getting to meet people.\n\nI\u2019ve slowly grown apart from friends since high school / college... yeah i have them on linkedin and they\u2019re half way across the country, but they\u2019re not the same and neither am I, how do I meet someone... I just feel like an outsider everywhere I go.\n\nI love gaming, but I feel like I am wasting time..  the friends I used to game we\u2019ve also lost touch and im so utterly bored.\n\nI guess part it feels like im being pulled in many different directions and I have no idea what to do.\nI honestly have no idea, im unsure of my path and I am afraid to take steps forward.\n\nPart of me wants to start game dev on the side for fun, but see my procrastination note...\n\nPart of me thinks about advancing my professional career, but then I have to spend hour of my time studying for the next examination, and I am afraid even if the next job I move up to feels the same level of boredom and lack of stimulation.  So my cycle begins of wasting time procrastinating when I could probably just spend that time studying...\n\nI need people to talk to and not just ones that I shoot the shit with on a daily basis.\n\nAs per my friend\u2019s suggestion, I started a bumble accout about a month ago since I\u2019ve never dated anyone but I do want someone to share my life with...  its been tough I get 1 hit every couple weeks and things seem to stop after 2-3 messages, do girls expect me to ask them out right away?  Then comes the part of what the hell do I do and where do we go?  I\u2019ve never been a social butterfly and I\u2019ve usually stuck to a lot of my same outing points.  \n\nLastly I\u2019ve always had some acne and redspots that I should probably go to the skin doctor to see about,  but last time I went they charged me thousands for cream that didnt work for a year and I felt like they didnt care whatsoever...\n\nI am 24 and I feel like I have no idea what to do, im not satisfied with my life.

So I had been to her house early that day to hangout, faced timed her boyfriend, watching BTS and Why Don't We and having fun. So I left after a while and we talked around 9:00 pm the same day. So I had a bit of a crush on her boyfriend and yes I've confessed to all of my crushes so far but since he was taken I didn't dare do anything. We barely even talked because we got off on the wrong foot (Rainey's fault since she told him that I disliked him because HE ruined one of my best friends 3 year friendship with someone) \n\nSo she KNEW I wouldn't do anything if it hurt her. So this is where is started, she began to ask me if I liked him and I said I do. So she started to tell me that he didn't love her anymore and she always left her on read. And then she started telling me that he would love me. Let me note this guy could be sweet and cute or unreasonable and toxic. Rainey had a history of manipulating people at her old school. She insisted that he would love me and that she'd be okay with letting him go even though I'd hurt. She said I should ask him out and kept bringing it up. Eventually I gave in because she made very good points on why he's no longer interested in her and how she was able to let him go to be happy.\n\nSo the next morning I asked him this exactly \"what would you do if your friend liked you?\" Nothing more. He said he'd stay with Rainey BECAUSE. HE LOVED. HER. I sent him the long paragraph she sent about how much she loved him. I said right after I'm happy you care about her so much. I NEVER went beyond this because I was never going to actually go through with it by the time I woke up.\n\nI should note it 9-10:00 am on a weekend when I would be sleeping. So I said I don't want to feel anything for anyone right now. She said \"I never knew you were like that\" and \"I had no right to feel heartbroken\" I told her that I never I was. She went full on- ugh\n\n\"I was DEPRESSED AND BROKEN!\" She said. She said she felt that way when I told her I would after her encouraging ME do to it.\n\nShe proceed to make me feel horrible about myself and said \"I betrayed her trust\" and ended with \"you should be lucky that I'm still your friend because anybody else would drop you\"\n\nSo you should know I have a past of suicidal thoughts, horrible depression and suicide attempts due to my thoughts going wild really quick. Having my best friend tell me this stuff set me off. I had a knife and started cutting away at my already heavily scared arm. I was crying heavily while writing suicide notes. I went to school the next days in tears and convinced she'd ruin my school life. Note I have the most friends in our friend group. So I went to school depressed as hell and within the first period I  was in the councilors room in tears.\n\nMy mom knew the councilor personally. I went back and sat with my other friend with my other friend that lunch. Everyone in my friends group still cared about me so I assumed she hadn't told anyone. Just note I was the one who got everyone to that table. This was weeks of my school work effects and my lightly cut arm\n\nI told everyone outside of that friend group and surprisingly they told me I wasn't wrong. They told me I was the one who was wronged. So after a while I got pissed because I realized I didn't deserve this and we fought every time we talked and I ended up saying sorry when she was obviously wrong. So then I told her that I wasn't wasn't completely at fault and that she was taking ZERO blame for SETTING ME UP. She told I needed to learn when to take the blame not talking about this (even thought it's obvious she was.) I had felt so pissed because of this.\n\nShe ADMITTED that she did this all to test because she had lost trust in ever girl around him. She was obsessed with him and even monitored his location.\n\nI know I'm older than her and seemed less mature, but she acted like she knew everything like heart break after having one boyfriend. We started to talk a bit again and then at our table I'd flat out ignore the pair. At some point, we started talking again and were back to normalish? Then she told me that in front of him we had to pretend we still hated each other. It turns out he was a total a-hole and he told her horrible things that's when unfortunately my sisterly love for came back and I openly told her how much I wants her to break up with him, for HERSAKE. She was in a emotionally exhausting relationship and he was probably cheating on her.\n\nShe eventually left him when she couldn't take it anymore. But honestly at this point I don't think I'd care if she was out of my life but at the same time we saved each other from suicide so I can't hate her but deep down I feel so hurt that she didn't trust me. Me and her don't talk about but she brought it up the other day and I told her it was uncalled for and had no right to bring it up. She apologized but she never apologized for testing me, putting this and saying that's nice when I reminded her I had went back to self harm that week.\n\nSo please someone tell me was it wrong?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We had a huge fight in December and I ended things. He was in a toxic romantic relationship with someone who had previously led me on into thinking he was into me when he just wanted attention from me and I couldn't handle that my best friend would do that to me so I walked away. \n\nA few months ago I reached out to him in search of some closure and his response was that he didn't want to open old wounds and that he did not want to restart the friendship. He said that he feels things are better this way, which really hurt. \n\nI miss him, I miss him everyday. We work together but still never speak to each other, only recently has he started greeting me if he sees me. \n\nHe seems hurt which confuses me, maybe he's hurt I walked away but I felt like I was the only one fighting at the time and I was tired. \n\nHis relationship with that person has since ended, maybe a month after my friendship with him ended. \n\nIn a perfect world I'd still have my best friend.

She lounges at my house all the time, I cook for her, I lend her my clothes, and I even pick up her little brothers from School from time to time because she asks me to. As of lately, I've realized how much I do for her and how little she does for me. A friendship is suppose to be reciprocation and effort from both sides and I always do things for all of my friends without asking for anything in return because it's what a friend does. But this certain friend, we'll call her M, makes me pay for her food, I cook for her, I wash the dishes, she asks to come over and all she does is sleep and asks me to be her human alarm, she tugs on my hair and hits me when her boyfriend doesn't text her back and recently got mad at me because a pair of jeans she wanted to borrow from me for a job interview was in the dirty laundry. I told her the jeans were dirty and I have to wait for my mom to do her load first and that I wouldn't want to give her dirty jeans because that's gross. M responds with \"so you're just not going to go against your morals and risk me not getting the job?\" I deal with guilt and anxiety and M knows this yet she has the audacity to act like I would be the reason she wouldn't get a job because I wouldn't let her borrow MY jeans and that made me feel like absolute shit and i ended up apologizing AND washing the jeans in a hurry to help her, which i now realized was added stress for me. I just felt obligated to do it because she's my friend. She degrades me by laughing at my selfies and tells me \"you can't be picky, you're rainymood247\" when I was asked what I look for in a significant other. I never really realized how much this friendship is more like a handmaid and house wife kind of relationship. I am constantly doing favors for her because I value our friendship and it's what a friend would do, but I'm not getting treated the same and have been hurt multiple times by M. I want to say something but she's extremely sensitive and will probably cry and it doesn't help I'm not a confrontational person so I don't even know how to approach it. Please help, we are both 19, and even my dad has told me she's extremely lazy and that he notices I Am always cleaning up after her and doing stuff for her.

{"post_id": "c6onoz", "created_utc": 1561750898, "title": "21/Female in Need of Friends!", "author": "macabre_mac", "self_text": " Basics:\nLocation and gender don't matter, I'm just in serious need of some friends. I work as a freelance horror artist. I'm absolutely obsessed with all things horror and scary movies. I'm a movie nerd in general. Libra (if that matters to you). I'd like to think I'm kind, sentimental, and funny, but that's up to interpretation. If any of this resonates with you, I'd love to talk.\n\n\nRant (sorry it's so long):\nI'm not sure how I ended up so lonely. It just kind of...happened. In a podcast I once heard something to the effect of, \"I'm popular, but in the way Bigfoot is popular. Everyone loves and knows Bigfoot, but nobody goes, 'hey Bigfoot! Come to my party!\" and that's me. \n\nIn high school I was heavily involved. Ran assemblies, was school Vice President, Homecoming Queen, Art Club President, you name it. Everyone knew who I was and knew me for my art. It was always \"ahh yeah I love her! She's so cool!\". I'm so grateful for that and it really was an amazing experience.\nHowever, this presence and reputation never aligned with my reality. The people who thought and said these things never had an interest seeing me outside of school. I was always the replacement friend. Everyone was close to each other and I was always the add-on, if I was included to begin with. There was a group of girls in particular I loved to hang out with, but as mentioned above, were all much closer with eachother than with me.\n\nThroughout elementary, high school, and present, I've consistently had a best friend. I've known her since kindergarten and I love her to death. However, the friendship is now more a matter of closeness and that we've known each other so long we cannot picture life without the other. She herself told me that if we met now as adults, we wouldn't be friends. Ouch...but I agree. We don't have anything in common so I'm unable to geek-out with her about my specific interests. She's a hiking courageous adventurer with a cold and dismissive personality (I'm not insulting her. This is just fact and a product of her childhood environment. I've accepted this and love her)\nWhereas I'm an anxiety ridden movie nerd who collects Halloween decorations, but is warm and reassuring and I love to love.\n\n(Sorry, it gets a bit heavy and personal here)\n\nAfter graduation, the group of girls mentioned above all parted ways and spread their wings, keeping in contact with one another while in university. Meanwhile, the day I was meant to start college was the day my mom started chemotherapy for the stage 4 pancreatic cancer she was diagnosed with just 2 months prior. I put everything on pause to care for my mom. She is my favorite human in the entire world I love her more than anything. I was such a mama's girl. I was her nurse. The sickness only took 5 months to take her life after the time of diagnosis. I was 19 when she died. It was traumatic, life altering, and earth shattering for me to say the least. Because of this, everyone I considered a friend left. They were too nervous and uncomfortable with the situation and didnt know how to approach me about it. I grieved in isolation. I live at home with my brother and my father. The relationship (or complete lackthereof) with my father is an entirely different story.\n\nNow I'm sad, lonely, and depressed. I'm trying so hard to stay positive and pick my life back up, but in the meantime I would just really love some people to talk to.\n\nAlso: first ever Reddit post. So sorry if I'm slow to respond or do anything weird haha idk I'm still getting used to the features and all that jazz.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We had great banter and both of us were excited to meet each other. Every now and then, she even told me that she is thinking about me.\n\nWe discussed deep topics for hours and openly discussed the things we like, what our intentions are and so on.\n\nWe originally planned to meetup today but because we just couldn't wait anymore we spontaneously met 2 days ago and it started off great. We were really clicking around halfway of the date. Long story short, I killed all the attraction and the mood by being inattentive to her subtle signals and hints as well as by not making a move until the end during this date.\n\nI was basically totally out of alignment with the situation and myself. I could tell she felt disappointed and maybe even rejected by me because I was so distant.\n\nAt the end of our meetup, we kissed and it was passionate but I did it way too late.\n\nBecause of bad logistics we decided to not go to her place. She then told me that right now she is 'too busy' with work and studying and so on and that we can keep texting for a bit as well as that I should send her a text that I arrived home (which I did).\n\nI was just so tired that I just wanted to go home and fall into my bed so I wasn't at my best the whole time.

After high school I met this guy who I thought was nice and we dated for a while. About 4 days before what was supposed to be our one year, he dumped me over text for his \u201cbest friend\u201d that I apparently didn\u2019t have to worry about. I was in a depressed and lonely state for a few months. In February, I met another guy who I thought would be great. We started dating in March. Throughout the whole relationship he assured me he wasn\u2019t going to go anywhere, that I was apparently perfect, and he\u2019d talk a lot about us having a future together. Then last week everything changed. He grew incredibly cold and decided to dump me over text, saying that apparently we\u2019re \u201ctoo different\u201d even though he said \u201copposites attract\u201d multiple times during our relationship. He\u2019s refused to talk to me in person or over the phone, he says he never intended to hurt me but yet he dumped me in the same way my ex did, and he knew how hurt I was from that. He was always saying very mushy things to me up to days before the break up. It feels like he never actually cared about me because of how he was able to do a complete 180 and how he hasn\u2019t bothered to check up on me, he also doesn\u2019t seem too concerned over the fact I deal with depression and suicidal thoughts, and I honestly really wanted to do it when he dumped me over text. He gave me a lot of false hope, and claims he still wants me in his life but he\u2019s making zero effort to make that happen. I feel very alone, it feels like every person I get close to in life eventually just throws me away once they\u2019re bored of me. No friend, or relationship has ever stayed in my life for long. It always is just temporary. I want a friend in my life that actually cares about me and won\u2019t just disappear on me. I have social anxiety, so reaching out to people or initiating any sort of friendship is difficult. All I want is a long term friendship, I don\u2019t want to feel alone anymore, I hate feeling so disposable. I don\u2019t want people to keep giving up on me anymore. I just want to feel happy for a change \ud83d\ude22", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Life isn't miserable anymore.. but for some funny reason I am. \n\nIts one of those times in life where the long night has passed.. There are no phantoms haunting me, nothing to bump in the night. But I have never felt so wholly and utterly empty. \n\nI do feel envy, to be frank. Envy for those of us that for some reason naturally gravitate towards things that they decide they love. Things which they are passionate for, things they enjoy - and are worth living for. \n\nI have nothing. I am nothing. Nothing but a collection of sensations and a lifetime of stories someone else has told me. I tried my hand at many creative things.. From drawing to music to welding. Tried just letting go and seeing where the wind should take me. But nothing ever stuck.. \n\nIts like.. I am doomed to feeling unfulfilled, unsatisfied and purposeless - even my sex life is an intense reflection of that, I'm sorry to say. \n\nMy sense of adventure is jaded.. Its the one thing I didn't want for my life. Stagnancy. Loss of life. But here I lay, withering... No better than a warmed up corpse. \n\nYou may call this one of the many last ditch efforts to try and save my soul. No, I will not die.. Mentally, though.. I can clearly feel myself dying and the ability to share some kind of genuine connection with someone would be.. Healing. \n\nAs a fair warning, I am rather demoralizing to be around right now. I'm in no mood to sugar coat or make social niceities, though you may see some lame attempts here and there to be positive.\n\nI'm not gonna die. I just want to be around someone who is genuinely excited about life. Who never lost that childish and wild-eyed enthusiasm I so badly crave. I'm good at learning by example.\n\nI tire of wearing a mask, and I am not judgemental, so i'd obviously prefer if you weren't either. Especially if I do feel an ounce of excitement for some reason and you witness the whirlwind of manic bliss I often endure. But if you are indeed fickle, I'd respect you all the more if you just came out and said it. \n\nBeyond all of this doom and gloom I am positively idealistic and I do think it'd be invaluable if I could come to love and cherish you as well. \n\nI don't know what the hell we'd do together, though. I was hoping to talk and maybe we could play some xbox if you're down for that. Minecraft would be cool. \n\nAs a human being.. I am the long walks in moonlight, philosophical meanderings, believing wholeheartedly that there is a consciousness in the universe and that you have to trust her... That plants have spirits, reality is an infinite construct and that while we are no more than animals among the rest - there is good reason to be here. Though it is often painful.. It all comes together to form a painting more beautiful than you could ever possibly fathom in this time-space reality. \n\nAnd music. Favorite artists are 40 Watt Sun, Nine Inch Nails, Deftones, Shawn James, Tool, Led Zeppelin, Danzig, Smashing Pumpkins, The Cure.. And a shit lot more. \n\nI'm not really a woman either.. If that makes any sense. Yeah, I have all the necessary parts for it but I'm afraid I don't quite 'get' or 'have' whatever the hell it is that other women seem to.. Its like a.. Social construct that I've never been able to live up to. I'm alright with that and I hope you are, too. It'd be fan-fucking-tastic to know what it was to have a friendship with a woman if you are indeed she. Not that I care for gender or any of such predetermined factors. Your gender and age are not factors.\n\nMy decree is, however, that you are _not_ permitted to be anything but your truest and most authentic self. Lest I sense that from a mile away. Transparency is of the utmost value to me right now. \n\nIf you're worried I'm going to devour you with some unintelligible nonsense and speak to you like I've spoken here.. I can promise you this is not the case. I sound and type little better than the village idiot if I for some reason get comfortable. I'm just trying to tap into the side of me that still cares about beautiful things with the post. \n\nYeah.. Message me if you wanna voice chat. I don't particularly want to jump to the topic of my despair but it would be ideal if we didn't have to talk like strangers. Like.. People trying to live up to an image. I just wanna be. I don't care if we sit in silence. Just fucking be here with me. Be yourself. I welcome the opportunity for a clean slate and fresh paint.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Recently I went through my life and eliminated a lot of toxic elements, and some elements that simply weren't adding any value to it... buuuut that has left me with only a single friend left. So, it's time to rebuild my friend circles! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm mostly a shut-in to be entirely honest. I avoid going outside if I possibly can, so as an adult it makes finding new friends very difficult. Especially when you hate small talk and most people in general. I hate that something as simple as \"How was your day?\" has become a throwaway question that illicits a feigned response. If I ask how your day was, or how you're doing, I am legitimtely asking. I wanna hear your ups and downs, your silly thoughts, things that were even vaguely interesting. I miss genuine conversation and concern for people, ya know? Despite the fact that I can't stand most people, I also love to connect with people. I rather enjoy the process of getting to know someone and understanding how their brain works. I love that genuine feeling of connection when you really understand another person, and I need more of that in my life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm hoping to find people from all walks of life, if possible. I want fellow shut-ins, I want extroverts, I want introverts, democrats, republicans, christians, pagans, happy-go-lucky people, and depressives. I welcome anyone so long as you're looking for that genuine connection, be it through conversation, games, music, or whatever else. I'm certainly not against meeting people either, if we live relitvaly close to each other in the same state and hit it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that I've rambled about what I'm looking for, here are the major interests in my life. I love video games, because what else would a shut-in do nowadays? Currently I'm heavy into Mordhau, but I enjoy games across the board with the exception of MOBAs and racing games. I have a heavy love for anything historical, philosophical, religious, or political. I am almost always up to talk about these topics at great length. I've watched a lot of the mainstream anime out there, and I'm currently working on Shield Hero with my girlfriend. I haven't watched too many of the smaller TV shows/series since I don't own a TV, but I have watched the bigger ones like GoT, Breaking Bad, Lucifer, Doctor Who, a lot of the marvel stuff, and some DC shows. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have other interests as well, but I'm struggling to think of them off the top of my head at the moment, so don't be afraid to ask about something! If any of this interests you, don't be afraid to hit me up! I'm not a huge fan of talking over Reddit, so I'd prefer to use Discord or Steam to message, or Skype if that's your bag. I could be convinced to grab whatever other programs as well if you're an A+ individual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA warning though, I'm not going to respond to people that just say \"hey\". Message me something interesting! Or weird. Or both, fuck it. I want people with some personality! I know a lot of us out here find it difficult to message a stranger on reddit, so for those of you out there that might be on the shy side or not know exactly how to start talking to someone cold, I offer an icebreaker: What is your favorite fictional universe and why?

We really got on, spoke for ages and then met in person a few months after. At some point, I'll be going to visit her in her country. I wanted to get her a gift because I feel like our friendship is so special and unique considering she doesn't travel and said she'd never meet anyone from online! She's really into anime/manga/cosplay - so I basically enlisted an award winning artistic friend to draw a version of her that looks like how she did we met, in that particular style. I also asked her to add her favourite cat in her arms, which she did! I think it's made for a really nice portrait type thing and I feel the gift is just as unique as the friendship.

Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Big Little Lies, The Handmaid's Tale, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90.

It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have a Kik, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now.

{"post_id": "c747gl", "created_utc": 1561840289, "title": "Looking for a close friend who is caring, puts effort in, + won't ghost", "author": "Roseylvia", "self_text": "I was doing really well recently but life's been getting really shitty and today I hardly feel like doing anything outside of my room. Please don't send me pictures of animals or aquariums or anything similar for the time being because I am really sad about getting rid of my fish and shrimp. Almost any other topic is fine as long as it is SFW. \n\nI like deep conversations especially. I am somewhat conservative but I enjoy thinking abstractly as well and exploring hypotheticals.\n\nWhat I hate in people: self-righteous but illogical, being uncaring and unsympathetic, and more than anything, people who want to be respected but don't respect others\n\nWhat I like in people: caring, honest, logical, kind\n\nIf you're ugly, or low IQ, or whatever, it does not matter much to me as long as you are kind.\n\nI tend to get along better with people who are easygoing as I am very strong-willed and passionate. I am okay trying friendships with other strong personality types, but know that I don't forget arguments easily unfortunately.\n\nAbout me:\n\nPros: knowledgeable, logical, artistic, great at coming up with things to talk about, put a lot of effort into a friendship once I like the person, honest, problem-solver, understanding of mental illness, and strong in the sense that death does not upset me usually, and if someone close to you dies, or you feel like you wish you were dead, I am not going to freak out (I don't support suicide and ofc will advise against it, but it's not something I'm afraid of talking about). In general not much surprises me and not many topics overwhelm me. (For example I have been driving for a little over a year on my own, and if an accident almost happens, I usually am strangely calm when honking or swerving around)\n\nCons: short-tempered, can get unreasonably angry, not easygoing at all, very rigid about life in general. If I get upset it is best to leave me be for a few hours at least. I am working on this but it is still not fixed.\n\nFew more things about me: I am 18F, live in EST time zone, people often think I am very smart (although, I am a complete idiot compared to some others I met in Physics), was diagnosed with Aspergers, OCD, and depressive/anxious symptoms (it is not very obvious to others though, and the latter is mostly better), Christian (Roman Catholic), just got AA and gonna be working towards BS in Math/CS, tutor ppl as my job, have varied between very gay to very straight (but tbh I have only ever had a few crushes on anyone), have a bf, and besides him only one other friend. I don't get notifications from social media (long story), so if I don't respond for a few hours or days it is not too out of the ordinary. But once I do respond I give a lot of attention, and I often contact people on my own.\n\nIt is okay if we don't have much in common, but here are my interests anyway:\n\nMath, drawing (people [both anime + realism], other things), programming, animals especially fish and dogs, music (mainly disney, anime openings, lofi, jazz, some opera), learning things when the need arises\n\nFinally, I greatly enjoy people who have a desire to better themselves overall.\n\n**Edit:** Oh yeah I forgot to say: online friendships it may be hard to see if it will work out, until you actually test the waters and start talking. So if we start talking and it doesn't really \"click,\" it is okay and even normal. If it seemed like we could have gotten along but then no connection was really there, you don't need to feel bad about it, and I won't either. Conversations may become rarer on their own, and that is fine, but if we are talking and all and getting along well, please don't just not respond anymore to anything -- that's ghosting and I don't do that either. All that depressing shit aside, I hope to make some good friendships! :)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I haven't had a real friend since I was about 10, and since about 5 years (since graduating from school basically) I haven't had a friend at all. My social life has been heavily affected for about half of my life(but more so during recent years) due to something fun called OCD. If you want to know more I've made a post on the OCD sub reddit(I guess checking my profile should make you able to see it) but it might possibly be a bit \"tmi\", and it is kind of depressing. \n\nBut enough of the misery! Ok, what else is there? Hmm.... ah, intrests and stuff! \n\n- I do like music. I don't like everything(most mainstream pop passes me by), but I'd say every genre has its gems. Favorites? Tom Waits, The Smiths and Queens of the Stone Age. The order doesn't matter, but that is my \"golden trio\". I \"get by\" on guitar, and have written a few songs, some of which must never be heard by anyone(including myself).\n\n- I do like films and series. I don't watch films as much as ai used to, but I've been going through a couple of shows lately. A few favorites are Sopranos, Seinfeld and Boardwalk Empire.\n\n- I would say I have a general intrest in most things creative. I don't know much about art, but I can get lost in paintings, so I really wouldn't mind knowing more about it. Same goes for poetry.\n\n- I have a big intrest in football(soccer), and it's been my longest lasting intrest. Apart from my family, this is basically what I have left since the time when my life was not yet affected my mental demons, so I guess that might add another layer to why I like it so much. Just having it on in the background can make me feel calm, I don't necessarily have to even watch it.\n\n\n\n\nI don't know what more to write, but I guess that's a start.

He had been brought home by his then girlfriend, Anna. I hadn't seen him in almost a year at this point.

Apparently, he claims that he was involved with gangs and the cartel in Mexico, and that, if that is true, then it is dangerous to be around him.\n\nShe also says that he is a user and an abuser.

I never really judged her or spoke badly about her because I was extremely emphatic to everyone. She was there for me with my personal things as well. We had gotten into little spats but it would end quickly and we would move on. \n\nFor the last few years, every time we go out drinking, it ends up in a fight. It\u2019s mostly her yelling at me and putting me down- even though I help her legitimately with a lot (more than most would). But I do it happily because I care about her. \n\nFlash forward to the other night we went out with friends. The entire evening I was getting attitude and I was treated like her servant. It really irritated me because all I wanted to do was actually laugh and have a good time seeing her because our schedules are opposite. As we are leaving, some things did not go her way. We then proceeded to get into a heated screaming match on the street because she was acting like a spoiled 3 year old demanding that we leave because she needed to leave and was giving everyone attitude. I wasn\u2019t going to take it anymore. I defended myself. I\u2019m not proud of the cursing or the yelling, but I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and I exploded. I walked away from the group we were with because I didn\u2019t want to say or do anymore things I would come to regret. I told her that her language she was using was triggering me because I\u2019ve struggled with anxiety and depression my entire life. I\u2019ve even struggled with  suicide and thoughts of this nature before. She was extremely intoxicated telling me to do it and to get out her face. I walked away, contacted my other friends, and got back home by myself safely. \n\n\nSince this night, she has blocked me on all social media and claims she never wants to speak to me again.  I\u2019m in shock, because she basically provoked this entire thing. I defended myself (in the entirely wrong way and I am willing to take accountability for it) because I\u2019m tired of being a doormat for people\u2019s  trauma and anger. I deserve to be treated with respect. Drunk or sober it doesn\u2019t matter. I really don\u2019t know what my next move should be.

I knew that I could still love you and possibly love you forever so long as what you said was true. I didn't mind playing the long game and hearing about you with other people. I really did want to be the support in your life,  the one who was there when you needed him.  I told you two things.  \n\nI told you \"don't be afraid to take advantage of my friendship.\" I meant this,  because even if it ever put me at a disadvantage,  or even if it was imposing,  I was happy knowing that I could be the reliable friend in your life,  the person that opposed all the toxic people you talked about,  the person who gave you little nudges to stay on a good path. \n\nI also told you \"But never take my friendship for granted.\" I said this because even as a friend who could give and give until I was out of anything,  I, as a friend, knew,, and still know my self worth. \n\nSo when it came down to it,  and I genuinely just wanted to share quality time with a person who I knew had many common interests with me and who I could connect with seamlessly, it became soulfully burdensome when you'd reject my ideas,   or worse,  accept my invitations and later change your mind.  You flaked on me so often,  and each time you did you flaked off a bit of my admiration for you as a person and my respect for you as a \"friend.\"\n\nNow, even though it still hurts,  I have no issue letting you go,  and moving on to better friendships and focusing on the things that bring me joy. \n\nTo any reader: if you have someone or a couple of someones that you call best friend, don't neglect them.  Most of the time,  I'm sure they'll be alright, but sometimes, they value your friendship so much they'll put up with your foolishness and sometimes they value you so much that they'll do most anything to spend a little time with you.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

We've all been friends for quite a while, and we all still get along well with each other. But now, because of their new status ( \"newer\", they have been for 4 or 5 months now), I've begun to think they would rather be alone together most times, because when I come, they stop their conversations, then resume it again when I leave, they have a bunch of inside jokes that I don't understand, they voice chat in private while we're all playing (this is an online friend group, but they're all that I have, because I'm homeschooled and live in the country, there's pretty much no one else around here), when they have public conversations it feels two-sided, primarily between the two of them, among other things. I understand that now they're going to want to give more attention to the other, that they are going to care about the other more, and such, it's perfectly natural, but still, now whenever we hang out together, I can hardly be with them for 15-20 minutes without feeling left out or like a third wheel. And, they know that I don't have any friends other than them, so sometimes I wonder if they just stay out of pity. But then other times, I convince myself not to worry about it, and it works, but only temporarily, and then the feeling of being a third wheel starts to creep back again. But I know that I don't want them to change how they act around me, especially not just because of me, but I also don't want to keep having to hide this from them (I don't want to tell them, because there's no right way to do so without it sounding jealous or immature; I mean I don't want to keep feeling like I'm dragging them down), and I absolutely do not want to leave/lose them, because they are both very important to me, even when I get those feelings, I still know that. It's just that I don't know what to do with those feelings, I've tried ignoring them, but it doesn't work, it just gets depressing, and it's difficult to hide, because they always seem to know when I'm down, and often even if it's just that I'm not talking much, they still ask if I'm okay. I want to find a way to cope with that feeling, as well as find out if I really am a third wheel, and still have them as good friends of mine at the end. Any advice?

Still iffy though, this is the internet after all.\n\nWho am I?\n\nI am a 27 year old full-time student, mom, and wife who has a silly and sometimes dark sense of humor, can be super sarcastic, and swears too much. I enjoy things like drinking wine before 5 o\u2019clock, eating pizza then complaining because I am still fat, and literally doing nothing while zoning out to reddit or some trash on TV.

I do have social anxiety which is why I turn to the internets to make friends. In text, I doubt you'll ever be able to tell though.\n\nWhat do I want?\n\nA million dollars and a full time nanny/maid would be nice. But I guess I will settle for a friend.

{"post_id": "c7giy2", "created_utc": 1561912633, "title": "I think my friend is slutty, and I know I need to not", "author": "SorryShop", "self_text": "So the title may make this sound worse than it is, but essentially I think a girl is slutty and I know that it's a bad idea to have I just don't know how to stop feeling that way.\n\nSo some backstory. And as an ahead a lot of this will be rather personal, and yes I know at the end of the day it isn't my business, but i'm trying to change a bad opinion and that's why i'm trying to speak candidly. I will straight up say all my thoughts in the hopes that maybe there\u2019s a crucial core to my feelings that people can help me change. I have kept a lot of this bottled up, so I apologize if it\u2019s long and there\u2019s unnecessary detail.\n\nMy friend, let's call her Nancy (31F), and I (M23) have been friends for a little under a year. It is a platonic relationship, although admittedly I may have had some feelings for her in the past, but I am over such feelings. I feel people will get caught up on this, but I can assure none of the following is rooted in previous feelings. Now I genuinely like Nancy as a friend, I agree on her with a lot of stuff and we came from similar backgrounds. That said there is one thing I really kind of disagree on, her view of relationships.\n\nIt's hard to explain in so many words, but she essentially views relationships as very disposable. Not to say she doesn't put effort into them, just that she has blatantly said she really doesn't ever expect a relationship to last and she's okay with it. I personally disagree, but i've never quite said as much to her.\n\nSecondly, and this is what I really want to change. I can't really shake the feeling that I kind of think she's slutty. Before I really dive into that, let me be clear, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to have sex be it with a committed relationship or honestly a hookup on occasion, I feel she\u2019s slutty for some mixed reasons. Let me explain why. Part of the reason I suppose is because she low key slut shames, she trash talks girls who dress provocatively, and she trash talks people who sleep around even though when asked she'll say she doesn't care if people do. I've known her for under a year and in that time she's had two committed relationships yet she's slept with around 5 guys. I know it's the modern era and all, but truth be told I guess I kind of do feel that's a decent amount for under a year when a good chunk of that year supposedly she was monogamous. \n\nShe does this thing where she\u2019ll be mostly seeing one person, even sleeping with them, but still dates on the side stating that they aren\u2019t exclusive. Supposedly she doesn\u2019t sleep with the guys she sees on the side, but I guess I just generally feel uncomfortable with that set up. I feel it\u2019s unfair to the main guy that she still sees others, and its unfair to the other guys that she\u2019s simultaneously screwing with someone else.\n\nShe also is really wishy washy with owning up to how many people she's slept with. As friends we shoot the shit and the topic has come up a few times, and she's changed her answer from as low as 9 to the high teens. And to me it seems kind of weird to either not know or to purposefully change the number so drastically. \n\nI will be square. The number of people she slept with isn't exactly sky high even if it is say 19, supposedly she didn't lose her virginity until her late teens if not at 20. Then she was supposedly in a totally monogamous relationship for 5 non-consecutive years. So with the 5 in the last year, 12 people over 5 years isn't bad I suppose, I mean yes I\u2019ll be honest it does still seem somewhat on the high side to me but I guess part of it is the people she has slept with.\n\nThe most recent guy she went on her first date with and four days later I know she was sleeping with him. Before that I don't know the exact timing, but I believe it was within a week of meeting the guy also. One of the last guys she was dating she knew had slept with over 40 women, and she shames him for it, yet she still was with him for a good little bit of time. Lastly I suppose I\u2019m kind of uncomfortable with the fact that she essentially had a fuck buddy for 5 non-consecutive years while she still dated other people.\n\nTo kind of wrap things up while we were hanging out once I was looking for something and opened her nightstand drawer to find tons of condoms, a deck of sex position cards, some weird pills, sex toys, and some sex outfits. In total fairness there\u2019s nothing wrong with any of this stuff, and it is totally normal stuff to have, I guess just kind of going back to how she can low key slut shame I found it a bit hypocritical to have so much stuff specifically geared for sex.\n\nSo all of this is to say, well yes I kind of think she\u2019s slutty but at the same time I know that\u2019s a wrong and unfair opinion to have. I want to get over this opinion, but it\u2019s hard to when everyone\u2019s answer is essentially \u201cwhat she does is her business.\u201d I agree, but it doesn\u2019t change my feelings and I really would like to as I do still see her as a good friend.\n\nTL;DR My friend has slept with not a ton but a decent amount of people and has some views on relationships I disagree with. I have reserved feelings she\u2019s slutty but I know I shouldn\u2019t think that way.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

After a while things seem to go quiet etc. so I thought I would give it another go. It's been many years since I was at school and let's face it, friends from education don't last forever. I did have a long term friendship of 12 years which broke down very messily and really hurt me, so I can sometimes be a bit cautious. Trouble is, I don't have much opportunity for interaction with people my age now, so here I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout me:\n\nI work part time in hospitality and I'm a part time student at the Open University. I'm currently studying a foundation level module centred around people, work and society. I was hoping to start a degree at the beginning of next year to broaden my horizons and improve my employability etc. but I'm not sure if it's for me. I'm non-religious; preferring to believe in mother nature and I don't like talking about politics. I'm currently dealing with poor mental health so there will be no judgements from me if you're in the same boat, but I don't really want to use each other as negative reinforcers and end up only talking about depression / anxiety. I'm trying to break a lot of negative thought patterns so it would be nice to lift each other up. I also have PCOS so any soul-cysters hmu!\n\nA few of my interests:\n\n* houseplants\n* astrology / crystals / runes\n* receiving pet pictures because I don't have any (esp. doggos)\n* music\n* graphic novels - october can't come fast enough for snotgirl vol. 3\n* netflix obvs\n* trying to live a healthy lifestyle - anyone want to motivate each other to go to the gym and not eat crap?\n* memes and general internet trash\n* BONUS ROUND: if you're currently watching love island please msg, I'd love to chat in the evening whilst it's on\n\n(*yes I know it's trash but it's my guilty pleasure.*)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOK that's enough for now.

I absolutely must. as of recent, my grades have been on a gradual decline and I want to return to my regular standard and I mean, 2 months is a lot of time. next year I have finals and I plan to finish the syllabus by the end of vacation so if anyone has any goals with studying, I'd love to have a study pal.\n\nsome miscellaneous things to wrap up this longer-than-planned introduction . vocally shy, voice chatting is a bit of a large hurdle. might be awkward at first until I get to know you better.

So if you can appreciate just a friendship then thanks a lot.\n\nAlso ive said this a lot but, please maybe try more than \"What's up?\" and \"I saw your post\".. Bc, someone posted something earlier - people get tired of seeing the same, tedious messages. I dont want casual friendships. Iwant bonds. I dont mind getting to know people obviously but not with short, meaningless questions h. \n\nIf u want to know abt me then look tgrough past posts. Ive also gotten into video games again kinda and gotten theough enough star wars to know whats what, although i forhot nearly all of their names lol!\n\nI do go through many mood swings, so if thats not something you can deal with, then i understand. if you want to know more youre completely welcome to ask.\n\nalso ask for my discord if u want\n\nand idk whatever i forgot lol", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I have a problem; I'm a skilled pretender.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you ask me how I'm doing, I will tell you, \"Great,\" with a sparkling smile and a, \"How about yourself?\" I will listen to you vent. I will hold you tenderly when you get sad. I will offer you my best advice, keep you accountable to solving your life's problems, pick you up and dust you off when you fall down. I am patient. I am kind. I deliver on empathy. I know what you need to hear. I say it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut here's my problem: I don't feel a thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've 'made it,' let me tell you. I earn a comfortable enough living that my partner is able to stay home and care for our child. People in my professional sphere look up to me, confide in me, praise me for my performance and insight. I am the youngest member of my company's management team, and the only female. Employees tell me I inspire them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut here's my problem: I'm bored out of my mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis career is a dreadful, incredible waste of my talents and time. I don't care about it at all. If I didn't need it to support my family, I would quit tomorrow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I don't have daily plans or obligations, I don't get out of bed. I tell my partner I'm tired, worn out from the week, haven't got much sleep. I guess in a sense this is true, but the exhaustion isn't from hard work. It's from pretending. It's from smiling when I feel nothing. It's from listening to my partner talk excitedly about the newest game they're playing or new content from their favorite YouTubers and forcing myself to scrounge up a modicum of interest. It's from feigning exuberance and playing pretend to give my kid a happy childhood. It's from having the \"can do\" attitude that propelled my career forward. It's from solving problems I care nothing about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay in, day out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe list of things I actually enjoy has grown painfully short. Most of them involve sitting alone in a dark room and not talking to anyone--but I suspect this is perpetuating rather than resolving some of my issues. Emergency isolation has been a containment measure, and not a solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI anticipate that some of you will read this and say, \"You sound depressed.\" But understand I am not sad. Or, rather, that sadness is a secondary symptom of my utter disengagement. I do not want a chat buddy with whom to wallow in our respective miseries. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I do hope to find here is an outside perspective, a positive energy, a friend with dreams and ideas. Please share your passions with me, whatever they are, so that I can better understand how to reignite my own. Open to insight and analysis, but don't expect you to play therapist for me. Above all, I want to find someone with whom I can be genuine. I'm tired of pretending but I don't know how to stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Isolated and disengaged from \"good\" life. If you still have a dream, HMU.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease be at least 25. Reddit chat is OK. I may be willing to move to another platform later, but I haven't gotten there with anyone yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for your replies, and thanks for being here.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

He told me every single day until I got a job that I was worth a job and worth his time and worth his energy and that he loved me and loved me and loved me. We went through more in 7 months than most people do in 10 years and that isnt hyperbole, just the truth.\n\nWe do silly normal things and normality feels amazing. I know that there's no such thing as normal but for me normal is making dinner with my fiance, going outside the house to discover new things together, and looking at ways to save money and looking at ways to meal prep. I'm picking out things for our house together - really his house that he moved me into and provided for me and is now allowing me to make my own.
