A long time ago, we were friends. Then for a short while, we were more then friends. One day she decided that we shouldn't be anything. Although we tried to be friends again, we became strangers. We grew apart.\n\nAlmost a year ago, we started talking again...We became friends, then I thought that maybe we should be more than that, But she declined. I accepted without any hard feelings, and thought that maybe it was a stupid thing to ask for, since we already tried that when we were teens and it fell apart. So we continued hanging out for a little while.\n\nBut then things changed. Fast. Or maybe they always were like this and I never noticed. She became cold, distant, harsh. Almost violent. We didn't agree on anything. I could never figure out what she wanted. The last time I went out with her, I just wanted to down the coffee I ordered and go. I decided to tell her that I'm having a tough time talking to her openly because she loses her temper and isn't patient. She just said something 'If you're uncomfortable talking to me, it is not my problem. It's yours.'\n\nI then realized that I should just stop talking to her. To be honest, I feel like there is nothing more to talk about. I don't think I have anything to contribute in her life anymore. It's time to move on.\n\nBut she keeps texting me once a month or so. I don't know what to say back. I don't want to talk. Should I just tell her? How should I phrase it?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\n**Update:** I think I ended everything with her today. She wanted to talk to me, wanted me to go out with her. I declined, and then I told her frankly what I thought. She told me that it's not like I was a bff or anything, but she wanted to hang out with me from time to time. I told her that we have nothing in common, I would much rather that she spends time with someone she finds really close or someone that is new in her life and can develop a brand new relationship in her life, and after a while we parted ways.

Lets call this friend Anne. We became friends back in middle school and we're now pretty much out of college. While we were in middle school, Anne had a friend who we'll call Jane. I then also became friends with this Jane. Jane and I had some issues towards the end of middle school and we eventually fell apart and it was pretty negative. Jane transferred to the same high school as Anne and I, but she then transferred out because of some personal problems. Well now Jane is back in the picture close to 8 years later. Jane has been able to secure a friendship with Anne again, however I want no part of this. Well now it appears that Jane and Anne are inseparable and I am getting left behind. Last saturday, Anne and I were supposed to hang out as we have pretty much every saturday night for a long time now. Anne had decided to hang out with Jane last friday and saturday. Now it is approaching time for me to go pick up Anne, so I message her to clarify what time exactly. Anne replies that her and Jane are out and about doing stuff. Fine whatever, since we didn't have a specific time set in place. I then set a time for about an hour after that to give them some time. I'm about ready to go pick up Anne, when she says that she is still with Jane. Why won't Jane go home? Why won't Anne tell her it's time to go? Eventually I decided to cancel the whole night out because it didn't seem like Anne wanted to hang out with me since she was hanging out with Jane even though we had plans. Also earlier in the day while Anne was with Jane, she was texting me asking what I didn't like about Jane (I expect to relay that information to Jane). I refused to answer those questions. So I could tell something was up. \n\nFast forward to tonight. I texted Anne asking if she wanted to talk on the phone. She said yes, so I called her. The phone call was very awkward and I could hear someone in the background who sounded like it could be Jane. I tried to ignore it at first and just have a normal phone call. Then I hear this person in the background say something to Anne and Anne replies to them whispering very quietly. Since she's next to the phone, it still comes trough. Then I asked why we were whispering and Anne told me to hold on, and muted her microphone. This microphone muting continued a few times until Anne decided she had to go. So now I feel like Anne is ruining my trust somehow. \n\nI don't care if Anne is friends with Jane, but all I want is for Anne to respect my wishes with keeping Jane out of the picture. If Anne were to say to me, \"nah I don't want to talk tonight\", I would have left it at that and been like ok cool whatever. Not a big deal. But the whispering and muting is causing me to be on alert. \n\nI don't want this to ruin our friendship, but I just don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advise? Something I should say or do? \n\nThanks!", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Then I go outside, the OF and others already being outside. I walk over to them to say hi and they all just run away. I feel a bit confused and really sad. I guess it was just a joke so I go over again, and again then run away. None of them will talk to me. This made me feel shit so I go over to PF (primary friends) and tell them what just happened. They say that I can stay with them for the rest of lunch if I wanted to. \nIt\u2019s about 20 minutes before the end of break before I try going over to OF again this time they don\u2019t run. The following happened.\nOF: *messing about with others* Hey \nMe: Ummm hi\nOF: why didn\u2019t you hang out with us this lunch?\nMe: because you kept running away from me and I didn\u2019t like that\nOF: well it was only a joke\nMe: it didn\u2019t seem like it and you guys didn\u2019t talk to me after.\nOF: you still could of hung out with us. \n\nAt this point I just let my feelings put\n\nMe: you know that you guys are like so weird *smiling laughing*\nOthers:* smile laugh*\nOF: *looks like I\u2019ve just slapped her*\nMe: it can be sort of embarrassing sometimes and I don\u2019t want to be judge by other people.

I got a job through a friend I have known since about 15 years ago. We haven't always been super close, but we've always kept in touch and we talk online on a semi-regular basis. When I started at this job, he had just left the position that I was filling, so people heard that I was my friend's replacement and immediately expected me to be a clone of him. He had worked here for almost 5 years at the time he left, and had a lot more working knowledge of things than a new employee like me would. \n\nNow he had made a lot of friends here that he had talked me up to before leaving, one of which is the only other person on my team. After not picking things up as fast as they expected (again, not a clone of my friend), people began to be cold towards me here. Before long, my friend actually returned to the company in a different role after finishing school.\n\nI got a message from my teammate on our messenger system that said quote, \"Man, (poster) is really not stepping up.\" It was sent to me by accident, but it was the beginning of the problems with me and my friend. My teammate was apparently REALLY good friends with him, and my friend stopped talking to me after that. He left the company again last summer, and hasn't spoken to me since. I went to his farewell party, I've tried talking to him, but I get blown off.\n\nIt really feels like shit knowing that I lost a decent friend of 15 years because of office gossip, and I don't know whether I should try and reach out to him or not. I wished him a happy birthday on FB when it came around, but didn't get any kind of response even though several others on his wall at least got a like. Should I cut my losses and move on? Knowing what I said about not really being super close friends, should I not bother?

Sometimes all at once. \n\n\n\nAs for what I am up to right now? Pretty unexciting, to be honest -  stressing about the future and wondering on the wisdom of dumping close to a grand on a plate carrier, because reasons \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\n\n\nPlanning on trying to join reserves, so am about as excited as it gets (/s) about doing basic training this summer, provided that I can get in. Also, incredibly-detailed paperwork is super fun (also /s). \n\n\n\n*If you are someone who is not going to bother reading the following wall, I encourage you to click the lil' X on top of this tab now. Thank you!* :) \n\n\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info (AKA full autobiography) about me:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate.\n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned career, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, which I am dealing with as best as I can - although recently, things have been on the mend - enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am somewhat stigmatized against the latter by some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not, in fact, a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandise and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed. \n\n- Gainfully *un*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work.\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Automata, WoW, DOOM, Bioshock, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. Honestly, for whatever reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nRight now, I am playing Rimworld on a higher difficulty. It is a journey - our 'scientist' had her arm chopped off because she went berserk from stress and I forgot to switch to unarmed when I had her apprehended.. \n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favourite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favourite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loathe cheap jumpscares they are so enamoured with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n\n- My sense of humour is possibly the worst, and I have dank memes ready for every possible situation and I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile humour. \n\n- My main hobby right now is Airsoft. I spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together since I ordered most of my gear from companies in Russia. I guess I really prefer quality, which is why I was willing to fork over money for real military stuff instead of more affordable replicas.  But at least the gear is quite nice and looks good. \n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I think it is time to give up trying to categorize what I like by genre, and instead do it by what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord) I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n\nRight now, I am super into Ghost, Pain, Marilyn Manson and .. Muse - if it is not obvious by this point, I am so edgy that I (used to) cut myself :D\nHere is a song that I like so much that I will listen to it on [repeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zx1ZtxUbGE) until I hate it. \n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%, due to a certain affinity for slithering neck-ties and positive human qualities like ambition, narcissism and general douchebaggery :D \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying.

After starting a new school I became best friends with this girl. We were super close and considered each other sisters, loved each other\u2019s families, talked about raising kids together, bridesmaids and all of that sappy crap girls talk about. A few years later a new girl joined our class and suddenly she switched and they were together all the time, went out constantly without me etc. Soon after our main friendship group broke up and my bff started hanging around with a group of Muslim girls( she was Muslim too so I guessed they got on better due to similar culture etc), one day she called me and said we shouldn\u2019t be as close anymore whilst laughing with her family in the background, didn\u2019t even seem bothered at all. I was upset for weeks as she was the only real close friend I had. Somehow we made up and I started hanging in that group, they even \u2018tested\u2019 me by messaging me one day pretending to be someone else bitching about them hoping to catch me out and cast me out the group - my \u2018best friend\u2019 did nothing. Skip to year 12 boat party, we travel there together and I mention I feel anxious, and she told me not to ruin her time...went off with her own friends and after it ended ( since we had to go home together) got me to pay for her friend to join our cab home too and taking pictures with her and didn\u2019t include me in any of them whatsoever, I felt like non existent. Skipping forward the new girl she replaced me with decided to cut her off, and she started coming back to me again , but as soon as she starts uni, she dumps me for this girl from our school who goes to her uni too. Long story short - recently she lost that friend too and tweeted saying \u2018you were gonna be my bridesmaid, godmother, sister etc and it just makes me think like wow I feel like this whole time I\u2019ve begged a friendship with her and she\u2019s always kept me as her back up best friend. Believe me I know friendships aren\u2019t based on silly things like social media and people are allowed to have multiple best friends, but it\u2019s the fact I constantly make the effort to message her, she only wants to meet up when there\u2019s a problem in her relationship and has no one else to talk to but never wants to spend proper time together, she never even takes photos with me like with her other friends, and sometimes I honestly feel like she\u2019s embarrassed of me as silly as it sounds, she\u2019s popular and pretty and im none of that but because I\u2019ve always been there and loyal she\u2019s kept me as her friend. I don\u2019t know whether to cut her off, or just distance myself from her and my expectation that I actually am her best friend or anything close because I\u2019m so sick of it.

My \u201cbest\u201d friend and I have been friends for about four years now. She has grown to be excessively emotionally dependent on me over the past year or so, even to the point where she is considering attending the same college as I am simply so we can \u201cbe closer.\u201d She has an issue with boundaries, always wants me to take her side in conflicts, and claims that \u201cbest friends tell each other everything,\u201d even though I disagree with those actions entirely. I\u2019ve basically been obligated to cater to her emotionally for years because she claims that \u201cI\u2019m the only person that makes her happy\u201d and really the only person that can mitigate her nervousness/sadness due to her familial issues. She texts me at pretty much all hours of the day and night in a continuous conversation. It saps my energy and expends my time. I feel really bad for her in that respect, but I can\u2019t be required to be there for her at all times and be her human coping mechanism. On top of all of this, she tends to be very derogatory toward me and makes fun of me in front of other people/embarrasses me in other ways, invades my physical space regularly, et cetera. It really wears on my nerves. Yikes. Sorry for the \u201ctidbit\u201d of backstory, but they are certain details that I consider important. Onto the rest of the story. My \u201cbest\u201d friend was involved in some drama with one of our old mutual high school friends. I am still friends with this person, and she has really been an encouragement to me and we see each other regularly. My \u201cbest\u201d friend and my other friend have been slinging arguments back and forth for months. My \u201cbest\u201d friend goes so far as to say she hates this person, even though my other friend has said nothing of the sort about her. I told my \u201cbest\u201d friend that I was still on good terms with the other person, and she seemed fine with it initially. She even claimed she wanted to be friends with her for a while as well until the conflict worsened. So, I felt that was all I needed to tell her. I went out with my other friend last weekend and we had an amazing time. She posted about me on Instagram to commemorate our reunion. My \u201cbest\u201d friend saw it, called me a betrayer, dishonest, and untrustworthy. She said she would need a break, and has not talked to me since. She even deleted her social media account because of me. I must add that while all of this was happening, a death occurred in my family last week and I have been grief-stricken. My \u201cbest\u201d friend promised that she would always be there to morally support me through this hard time, but obviously it was on conditional terms because she has been avoiding me for a week (and has even skipped school every day for an unknown reason). So. Apologies for the novel. However, I must restate my initial question: Is my \u201cbest\u201d friend overreacting? Am I the one in the wrong? Additionally, should I attempt to rekindle this friendship if possible, or try to get out of it (since I feel it is toxic)?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Ann is easy going person and calm in nature, so she's adored by our whole batch mates. However, Tina is friendly but she often gets emotional and childish at times. We eventually became best friends until our last year, which is now.\n\nThe three of us always get into arguments and fights intended for laughs and fun. They were never serious and everyone knew that. But one night during our teacher's exchanging school party, Tina disappeared before the party even started. Ann and I searched for and found her sitting on the steps of a deserted staircase at an empty dorm building. We tried to make her join us because it's dangerous to be alone at night, trying to be as coaxing and patient as possible, because Tina is a sensitive person. \n\n An hour later we eventually left her because someone brought us some food for her to eat. Through out the party, Tina didn't appear and people constantly asked Ann and I where Tina is and why she's alone. We said that we didn't know why, because she's keeping quiet and ignoring us. \n At the end of the party, someone gave Ann and I some cash to buy Tina the shirt for the party that everyone were obliged to wear, but some of us didn't and one of them was Tina. Ann and I doubted it was the reason why she's so upset but we purchased the shirt nonetheless. \n\n When we came to Tina, all of her food were untouched and she looked as if she was pissed that everyone were so concerned about her. Ann asked again if she would tell us what's the matter but Tina tried to kick us out. I started losing my shit and yelled at her what's wrong. Tina started crying and yelled something is similar to the line on the title. Ann tried to stop us. When it ended, Ann and I left to our dorms while still unable to believe what just happened.\n\nThe next day we found out the reason Tina was so upset because someone told her she will spoil our batch for not wearing the obligatory shirt. \n\n The third day, Ann and I went to apologize Tina but she ignored us. Then I saw Tina chatting and jumping excitedly with the girl WHO CALLED HER FOR SPOILING OUR BATCH.  I was enraged and in confusion, why did Tina bailed on us but decided to be her chirpy side with the girl that was the reason of our fight? The girl has always been a bad taste to everyone, so why the sudden treatment? \n\n I know this is a lengthy story,but I just wanted to know what should I do next.

So I've been working at my job for about 10 months now and I have noticed that everyday it seems like the people there are getting more and more unfriendly to me, not the guests that go there, but the coworkers. I work at a recreation center like a YMCA but there is only one location around. I supervise children while their parents do their workout routine. I started to work the morning shifts as I thought the evenings were too much, since the majority of employees are teenagers in high school (I am 21 by the way). \n\nSince they all know each other and I wasn't known, or part of their posse, they would start unnecessary drama, it wasn't as noticeable at first but now I have been picking up on cues. I am a pretty shy, quiet guy that just wants to do my job and leave which I guess makes me a good target. But now I believe they have been possibly spreading rumors or slandering my name to the managers and staff that are older as they don't even try to acknowledge me or say hi. Many even ignore me when I try to talk to them or they completely change their demeanor when speaking to me. \n\nI noticed one girl would be harsh with me but friendly around everyone else so I asked her if she had a problem with me and she was being passive about it and trying to avoid the question by twisting things like: \"I do not not like you\" trying not to admit she doesn't but say it in a way to where she wouldn't confess. After I told her this, my manager came down a couple minutes later and asked me to switch to another area in our building to work, this has happened twice already when covering someone's shift for the evenings. Sometimes you get that guy feeling when somebody doesn't like you or is lying and this is how I feel with the majority. I like the job, it's great, but I don't know if it will be worth staying there. Should I find another job? I'm worried if I do then it will look bad on my work history as I already had 2 jobs prior to this one. ", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

It sucks that this is what I struggle most at.", "author": "Ebonlocke", "self_text": " \n\nGreetings again. I return to this sub again to hunt for those who are as like minded as I am, especially when it comes to looking for someone that wants what I want in terms of friendship. I'd really love if I could find somebody that I can not only confide in and form an everlasting bond with, but also someone I can do things with, such as playing video games, or watching TV shows with.\n\n**The about me is below. Please, don't PM me unless you're serious about committing to a friendship. I'm really starting to get sick and truly upset with people flaking out on me after a single week.**\n\nI'm basically back looking for friends, since it seems I just can't find a soul willing to actually stick around for more than a few weeks. I'm a 28 year old male, hailing from the East Coast of the US.\n\nA little about me, and various hobbies. For one, I'm very into music, all facets of it. I listen to it, share it, create it, and mix it. I'm very into sharing music with others, learning about their tastes, and even seeing if I can get them into something new.\n\nI'm also very, very big into anime as well, and one thing I've been searching for big time, is someone that I could sit down for a few days or nights a week with, and watch some new series together, and discuss it.\n\nI'm also a very avid gamer as well, focusing on PC, Switch, and PS4. My favorite genres are RPGs, JRPGs, MMOs, and all sorts of others where I can sink tons of time into. Right now I'm playing Kingdom Hearts 1.5 and the Higurashi VNs, and I'm also binging through Kamen Rider Build when I'm not gaming or working.\n\nAlso, I'm very LGBT+ friendly. As a bisexual man myself, I would be delighted to meet other gay, bi, trans, people! I like talking to everyone, whether they be guys or girls.\n\nWhen it comes to friendship, I'm looking for someone that isn't afraid to be themselves around me, and won't be afraid of talking to me when something is amiss. I want to be there, not only for the good times, but also the bad ones as well.\n\nI'm a very approachable person despite being quite pessimistic and cynical, but I'm also very caring deep down. I'd love to meet anyone who is either in the same position as myself, or is willing to seek out a lifelong friends to truly explore life with.\n\nI primarily use Discord, Skype, and Steam for text communications as well, if you wish to chat more off Reddit!\n\nOne rule I must add, is that I will only talk to those 18+. Just a personal thing, really.\n\nI hate feeling so lonely, I really do. It's gotten to a point where I really feel like I don't have anyone, especially since at this age, most friendships are comprised of co-workers, and where I work, no one wishes to be friendly with each other.\n\nI just wish I could have someone that actually cares about how I'm doing. Wants to talk about their day, whether it was good or bad. Someone who goes above and beyond simple small talk. Someone who I can be talking to for years, and years on end, and truly feel that special bond. Is anyone really out there, anymore? :/ These are the people I REALLY want to find.\n\nI really, and sincerely hope I can meet some delightful people today. &lt;3", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

She also told me that she doesn't want me to talk about anything else that is negative in my life because it bums her out. \n\nAnyways, should I still be friends with her?

Although I don't see her as much as I did back then we still talked almost every day for years, until recently some pretty shitty stuff has happened in my life and I've been so depressed I haven't really spoken to anyone as much. However, we were still really close and she was the only person that I felt I could open up to.\n\nI became friends with a girl called Evie (again not her real name) about 2 years ago, she was going through some shit at the time similar to myself now. We became good friends at school although I didn't really speak to her much outside. But, in the past few months when I've really just needed my closest friends to be there for me she has just turned against me with a group of other girls and are literally trying to make my life a living hell.\n\nI told Penny some of the things that Evie and the others have been saying to me and about me, and she knows that they are really sensitive and personal and really affect me. Of course I don't give them a reaction but it's still hard to not let it impact me just a bit.\n\nOne of Penny's friends from school just had a party, and Evie was invited. I mean I don't really mind because it's not like Penny personally invited her and I can't tell anyone who they can and can't be friends with, but we have had many conversations where she personally told me that she didn't like her after all the things she has done. Penny sent me a really long message before going begging me not to be annoyed about Evie being there, and obviously I said to her I didn't mind and I wasn't annoyed.\n\nHowever, tonight when they were at the party, not only them both but even other people posted photos of them hugging and smoking together (bearing in mind they've only met once and this was at my birthday meal). I feel like I'm just being pathetic because even just typing this out makes it seem so petty, but I can't help but feel upset. Obviously I can't control her and she can choose who she wants to be friends with but I just feel betrayed, I just want to know if I'm being irrational by feeling this way or if it is completely justified.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

What do I do?", "author": "Zer0Charizma", "self_text": "Hi, this is my first text post on reddit and it's a long one so I'm very sorry. \nAnyways, I am having a bit of trouble with my friend (let's call her Sarah) because her boyfriend hates me (let's call him travis). The reason he hates me is because I used to be really close to Sarah and we spent a lot of time together since we had a lot of classes here in university. Travis and Sarah had a causal sexual relationship that became something that it shouldn't of. Sarah got emotionally attached to travis while he would go and constantly leave her and say that any emotional attachment to him would be a terrible mistake and then proceeded to start having sex with almost all of her \"friends\" from back at home. Sarah would be left in tears and depressive state while I stuck around and helped her and tried to get her out of the mood. \nSarah finally started seeing other people (which didnt end to well due to the abusive tendencies of the guy) and she was dead set on being alone. That's when travis decided to start messaging her again after he has dropped out of university and lives 30 minutes away. Travis goes and says he wants to try a relationship with Sarah which seemed really sketchy to me and I told sarah about how I felt about the situation. She responded to me with \"he has changed you wouldn't know\" only after talking to him for a couple of days. They are now in a relationship and travis heard about my suspicions about him from Sarah's roommate. Which then proceeded to travis coming down to university and seeing Sarah with the real intention of meeting me here and saying that I should stay away from her because I put bad ideas into her head (which this is the condensed and less hostile version of the encounter). I tried to tell Sarah what happened and she just dismisses me saying he would never do that. Now she is going and talking to me condescendingly which I presume is due to travis talking badly about me. What should I do or say about this situation? Sorry for it being so long this is just another way for me to vent a little bit. \n\nEdit: So as a update to what has happened. Sarah had me meet up with her about a week after I made this post so we could talk one on one and she ended up going and berating me, even though I have stayed away from their relationship. She said I am just getting in the way of her happiness and that I should just go and stay away from her. Not a day after that another friend of mine said she was getting intimate with a guy (who turned out to be travis which was now confirmed to be cheating on Sarah) even after Sarah told me to stay away I couldn't let something like cheating continue so I sent her the proof of what he is doing and was on my way. Sarah went and yelled at me some more for not putting trust into her boyfriend and Travis came and paid me another visit leading to him mocking me for trying to do the right thing even though Travis will always get what he wants. So now Sarah hates my guts and Travis is getting away with a lot of stuff he shouldn't be. Fun... ", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I shouldn\u2019t post about this because it\u2019ll come back to bite me in the ass, but who cares anymore. \n\nBackstory: He and I had a really long run, but he started re-writing history to better suit his narrative of his new relationship. \n\nI was with him through everything. He sexted my best friend and I took him back. He had a whole scandal back in April of 2018, when he had all of his sexts with girls leaked and he lost most of his friends because he was doing all of this while still telling me how much he loved me. I still believed him when he told me that these people were just telling me these bad things about him to make me not like him or support him. Well I forgave him and we moved forward, but if I\u2019m being honest things definitely had changed. I didn\u2019t trust him as I used to and he would constantly tell me things like \u201cyou either trust me or you don\u2019t\u201d if I questioned anything. \n\nI had a lot of issues that I don\u2019t want to get into publicly and I would try to get advice from him and he would push me away. He would always tell me that he was dealing with things, but would also never tell me anything about them. \n\nFlash-forward to July 2018.\nI asked him about a girl that he implied months prior that was just a girl he knew in a group and he finally told me she was his girlfriend. My friend asked her when she started dating him knowing that I had been involved with him, and his girlfriend told her February 2018. I had been exchanging romantic and sexual messages with him up until a few days prior. He assured me that his girlfriend was confused because they were casually talking until then and they were certainly not together when we were together. I still thought nothing of it because why would he lie to me? \n\nSince then I have been receiving messages from a stalker-type (think Pretty Little Liars A) telling me all of the lies that he had told me were not true and that I needed to ask more questions. The more I would ask questions, the more he would give me the \u201cyou either trust me or you don\u2019t\u201d narrative. \n\nTonight he cut ties with me after completely re-writing our history to make me out to be some delusional mess. He cited the stress of his life as the reason he can\u2019t continue our friendship, but I truly think he\u2019s feeling the pressure of not being able to keep face.\n\nI don\u2019t care anymore about the friendship/relationship/whatever. I don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t deserve to be lied to and I don\u2019t deserve having someone claim to care about me, while also telling me all of these lies and telling me that it\u2019s my fault that all of this is happening because I\u2019m \u201cmiscommunicating\u201d but really I\u2019m not. I\u2019m telling the truth and he can\u2019t keep up with his lies. \n\nMy issue is that I don\u2019t know how to trust anyone again after all of this. This was a huge friendship for me and he was a very important person in my life, but he lied so much to me and about who I was. Idk I think it is partially my fault because I took him back after everything and maybe I needed all of this to see who he really was as a person.

She\u2019s has been married for about 8 years and They\u2019ve recently had their first child together.  \n\nShe\u2019s told me about several major ongoing issues that she and her husband have had in their marriage. I have only ever given advice if she has asked for it in specific situations. \n\nShe\u2019s tried everything to make progress or find solutions to help them with their marriage. However, any little changes that happen always stop. She has basically just resigned herself to an unhappy marriage for the rest of her life. \n\nI cannot stand the thought of her just living the motions of life and being so unhappy. I know she is such an amazing person and she deserves to be able to enjoy life and be herself. But I feel the only way she would be able to do that is to be divorced form her husband. I think she\u2019s scared of not being a \u201cwife\u201d because that\u2019s what her identity kind of revolves around at the moment. I have wanted to speak to her about this for about a while now, but sometimes I feel as though it\u2019s not my place to suggest something as big as divorce. I know she would probably struggle a lot having to be a single mom, but I know she would thrive. \n\nThe only reason I\u2019ve held back is because I think back to a situation I had with another friend where I thought I was being helpful and supportive. I sent him a link to something that basically said \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be gay\u201d but he was very offended and almost stopped speaking to me because of this. (Turns out he wasn\u2019t gay just trans.) \n\nI don\u2019t want my suggestion to be taken the wrong way and kind of push her away because I know she could be very happy and actually enjoy life.  \n", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Only in brief moments do I feel sad about not having friends. But I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m ever going to be able to form any decent friendships in my life. \n\nI\u2019ve had many bad experiences and am honestly tired of people now. I\u2019ve learned to have values and principles and stick by them. But I feel like after a certain age, friendships are so hard to form and harder to maintain. \n\nI never had proper friends in school or as a kid. I went to a small school where I was the black sheep and lived in an area where there were no boys for me to hangout with. \n\nI also never went to university so I missed out on that phase of life. I\u2019m over it now. But for a while, it used to really get me down having missed out on those years of life and experiences. \n\nI\u2019m not old. I\u2019m 26. I have time still to do wacky things. To an extent of course. I can travel and backpack I know. I\u2019m just a bit down that I never get to meet guys that I can relate to in person. I know and listen to people online that are like minded to me. That helps a lot. I\u2019ll probably connect with them to some extent in the near future via the internet. \n\nBut I guess I just want to know if friendships are what they\u2019re made out to be? Am I missing something here by having none?\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve only known people who are financial and emotional parasites. And when I was a kid and teenager, was always getting mocked first for my looks, then personality, then beliefs. I was never false. I was always myself. And I wasn\u2019t liked for who I was. Oh well. \n\nBecause I\u2019ll never get married or have kids, I know life is going to be in some ways, lonely and empty. I don\u2019t mind it though. I wouldn\u2019t want some kid having me as a father for them. And I can\u2019t stand the idea of my wife waking up next to me one day and in her mind and heart asking, is he really the best I could do?\n\nI\u2019ve just been unlucky I guess. Missed out on a lot of traditional things that many don\u2019t and was the misfit for the most part. Square peg round holes vibes if you get me. \n\nJust wondering if others have any relationship issues I guess. ", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I'm going to put as much information that isn't too personal about myself into this post, so that you get a very clear idea of my personality. That means that this'll be a long post. Everything has been categorized, so that you don't have to read everything if you don't want to. There are numbers behind the titles for each category. I need you to read numbers 2 and 7 and I recommend that you also read 1 and 3.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntroduction: My name is El\u00eds. I moved from Iceland to Sweden at the start of 2016, when I was 12, along with my parents and 2 baby brothers. My family and I love it here, I personally had a pretty rough start, but I feel very good now. I of course play video games, listen to music, watch movies and series, like most people on Reddit do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. About me and you: I'm very patient, so if you're shy then please take your time talking to me through VC. I expect that we'll eventually chat through VC, though. Hopefully we'll eventually chat regularly. You don't have to own any games for me and you to become friends, I'd love to just get to know you and chat. Don't worry about the time zones, I play with a bunch of Americans, some even on the west coast and we manage just fine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Discord: I won't add you unless you have Discord, as I'm looking for a long-term friend who's down to talk every once in a while or more. I'll give you my Discord name if you send me a Private Message. Hopefully you can get to know me and some of my friends and maybe I could get to know some of your friends :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. About me and my friends: If you get offended easily or don't understand sarcasm, then we're probably not what you're looking for. Outside our humour, I'd say we're pretty nice people, though maybe I shouldn't be the judge of that. A lot of the people that I play with are Icelandic, but we'll almost always (Or always) speak English, even if there 4 Icelandic people and 1 non-Iceland...er..? We play with a bunch of people that aren't Icelandic, so you wouldn't be the only foreigner if you were to join.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Games: I've played a whole bunch of Single Player games. I've played through Spider-Man (2018), Red Dead Redemption 2, Fallout 4, Batman The Arkham Knight, Far Cry 4, a lot of Telltale games and many more games. My favourite game of all time is The Witcher 3. I of course also play Multiplayer games, some of my favourites are Rainbow Six Siege, Grand Theft Auto V and of course Slendytubbies (sarcasm). I don't expect that anyone plays Hearts of Iron IV, but the new update just came out for that game and me and my friend are planning on playing that in the near future. I just recently started playing Fortnite.. well, I've technically been playing it since season 4, but I only downloaded it (because my friend forced my to) and didn't play it much. When I found out that you could get the Battle Pass for free for this season, my buddy helped me grind (it didn't take very long) the challenges and now I've given Fortnite a more \"serious\" chance. Note: Me and my friends don't take games very seriously, we'll rage, but we're not exactly good at the games we play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. Movies and Series: I've watched a lot of movies. I like most genres, but I love horror movies. I also really enjoy superhero movies. Some of my favourite movies are Fight Club, V For Vendetta, Interstellar &amp; The Dark Knight Trilogy. Some of my favourite TV Series are The Haunting of Hill House, Daredevil, Dexter, The Walking Dead, Better Call Saul and my favourite series of all time is of course Breaking Bad. Those are only some of my favourite movies and shows. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. Music: I'll listen to \\*literally\\* any music genre. For me it all depends on the song itself. Though I've been listening to a lot of Muse and Radiohead lately. So I guess I've been listening to a lot of Alternative &amp; Art Rock? Don't worry, I also listen to the classic bands, like Queen and The Beatles. I love music and I'm always interested in what other people listen to. Hopefully you also have a huge passion for music. Maybe we can even share to one another some of our favourite songs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7. Private Message: If you're interested in becoming friends, then I want you to send me a Private Message, telling me a little about yourself. The message doesn't have to be nearly as long as this thread. Though if you wish to write an entire paragraph, then feel free to do so, I'll read your message either way. If you only write \"Hello\" or \"Hey, what's up?\" I won't respond, as I've written 1000 words, so I expect that you'll at least tell me a little bit about yourself. I want to know either what time zone or what country you're from and I want to know your age. Only add your gender if you want to, it won't effect me. I want you to write a little bit about yourself, your interests maybe, only so that I get an idea of your personality. Don't worry, I get along with mostly everyone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8. Finishing this thread off: I hope I've answered all of your questions here in my thread. If you have any questions, then just ask it in your Private Message. Thank you so much for reading. I hope I get to know you and that we'll become good friends in the future. \n\n\\-El\u00eds ", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Anyway for my birthday she later told me she was too busy with college apps to text me happy birthday on my birthday. She told me she didn't forget my birthday though and to test her I asked her and she knew the date. My previous birthday she bought me whatever I wanted at the mall but I had to ask her to do something for my birthday on her own (she didn't), set the date for the plan and ask her to buy something for my birthday. For all of her birthdays and mine I did all the planning.\n\nI didn\u2019t text my \u201cbest friend\u201d in 6 months and she never reached out. I initially didn't plan to not text her for this long. I just wanted to see how long it would take her to initiate text before I got too desperate. When asked in real life about it she said she was busy with college apps.\n\nAll this time I thought she accidentally lost my number because I lost hers and thought I accidentally blocked her but in reality she had my number this whole time. I was so desperate that I spent an hour trying to remember my old snapchat and another hour getting wifi to text her on snapchat. She told me that I was still her #1 best friend and that she cares about our friendship just as much as I do AND she said that she texted about making plans but I just didn't get them. When I asked her to show me these texts in real life she said she meant she responded to the text that I SENT HER 6 months ago about making plans. I didn't text her back in 6 months to see if she would ever initiate text and she didn't. \n\nI decided last year to stop talking to her in real life and we didn't talk for a month. That showed me how much I really was the person who was always initiating conversation. \n\n**Update:** I feel like if this wasn't a situation that I was so emotional about I would be able to think rationally and I know I've hit an all time low in terms of self-respect to ask this on yahoo answers but we've been friends for so long and had a few good memories and I don't know why this is so hard for me to let go. I had no problem letting go of my previous best friends.\n\n**Update 2:** One of my previous friends 3 years ago told me that I was really desperate when I asked her for her true opinion and I think she's right. It's so sad that I've never had a friend in high school who initiated conversation with me or initiated to make plans with me or texted me first. The \"friends\" that did do that ditched me the second they were accepted by the popular people. I really hope one day I have friends who appreciate and reciprocate my effort.\n\n**Update 3:** I know that there are good people out there tho because I have had classmates come to me privately and told me that they wish they had a friend as loyal as me and that I deserve better friends who are as loyal as me and put in as much as effort as I do. This says alot to me that I must've really hit an all time low if random people are willing to chime in because that's how bad its gotten because usually people don't do that. I appreciate these people. I bet no one will even answer my question.\n\n**Update 4:** Please give me your 100% uncut opinion\n\n**Update 5:** Everything happens for a reason. I know that me \"accidentally\" losing her number was god being like \" get some self respect sis you deserve better\" but my desperate ass still found a way to get ahold of my toxic friend again. We haven't seen each other in real life in 9 months and this girl still was sitting there telling me there's nothing to talk about. I initiated out of probably 50 conversations 49 of them.\n\n**Update 6:** WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER IN 9 MONTHS AND SHE STILL COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING TO TALK ABOUT WITH ME.\n\n**Update 7:** Also another who has been through something similar like this how do I attract friendships that are 50/50 and not as toxic as the one I have with my ex-best friend\n\n**Update 8:** PS I HAVE BLOCKED HER NUMBER AND HER SNAPCHAT. EVERYTIME I TELL HER I DON'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS I GO CRAWLING BACK. THIS TIME IM DROPPING HER WITH NO EXPLANATION. IF SHE CAN GO 6 MONTHS NOT TEXTING ME, AT THIS RATE I WILL ALREADY BE IN COLLEGE SO IT WON'T EVEN MATTER ANYMORE", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Recently my life has been going downhill very fast and it just feels like no one really cares at this point. I'll be the first to admit I'm socially awkward so I can't promise I'll be open to you immediately, it will take me a little to warm up.

{"post_id": "ax3h98", "created_utc": 1551677513, "title": "I feel like I\u2019m back in high school!", "author": "plasticpilea", "self_text": "I\u2019ve been friends with the same group of girls since high school. We\u2019re all in our late 20s/early 30s now, and I\u2019ve kept in touch with them despite living interstate for 5 years. I moved back to my hometown early last year, and was excited to spend more time with them. I was also a little nervous about reintegrating into the group after 5 years away; they usually catch up two or three times a month, depending on schedules etc. and there\u2019s a contrast group message thread running on Whatsapp that I\u2019ve always been part of, even when I was living away.\n\nWithout going into too much detail, I had a bit of a rough year last year, and they were all very supportive initially. Then, around October, one of the girls called me and basically told me that I wasn\u2019t pulling my weight as a friend and that I should be calling each member of the group on a weekly basis to catch up (never mind that I saw them all at brunch several times a month) and that in addition the Whatsapp thread, I should be in communication with them individually via text as much as possible. This was news to me, as no one had been calling me on a weekly basis, or sending me private AND group messages. I was also told off for talking about myself too much, and I had been talking about myself a fair bit, but only because I was answering questions they asked me. I made a conscious effort to steer the conversation away from myself, and let the others have their say, but apparently that went unnoticed. \n\nI\u2019m a doctor, and I\u2019d just started work at a new hospital, but one of the girls was getting married overseas and I rearranged my entire year, essentially, to be able to take annual leave so I could go to her wedding. I happened to be working nights when she had her bridal shower, and because I\u2019d allocated my leave so that I could be at the wedding, I had to take a day of leave without pay to go to the shower. I was exhausted, having been up working all night before the party, and so was a bit of a zombie for the actual event, although I stuck it out as long as I could. She had a second bridal shower at the resort just before her wedding too, but apparently she was really hurt that I was running late for her first bridal shower (driving home from work, shower, cat nap and get ready) and didn\u2019t stay until the very end (made it to the first bar, but might as well have been an actual zombie by that point because I couldn\u2019t stay awake), even though several others left before or at the same time as I did. \n\nA similar thing happened with a baby shower. It was a couple of weeks after the bridal shower, and I was on nights again. I couldn\u2019t take another day of leave without pay because I\u2019d only been working at the new hospital for a month, and I couldn\u2019t call in sick because I\u2019d already asked to swap shifts and the boss knew I had the baby shower that day. So I went and stayed as long as I could, but same story - she was hurt that I left early because I needed to sleep before work. \n\nLastly, if I pick up a last minute locum shift, I can earn up to $1400 for a day\u2019s work, so on a couple of occasions I told the group that I\u2019d be free to catch up as long as I didn\u2019t get called in for a shift. The girl who gave me the telling off last October basically said that taking an extra shift wasn\u2019t a good enough reason to miss a group catch up, despite knowing that I\u2019m trying to save enough for a house deposit. Her terms seemed a bit unfair to me, given that everyone else has said no to various brunches and dinners on multiple occasions, and that work had been an acceptable excuse in those instances. \n\nSince the beginning of this year, I\u2019ve felt as though I\u2019m slowly being iced out of the group. The Whatsapp thread seems to have died, so I suspect they\u2019ve made a new one that doesn\u2019t include me, and I can\u2019t imagine that they\u2019ve gone two months without catching up with each other. They actually went out for a fancy lunch to celebrate one girl\u2019s birthday, and I wasn\u2019t invited. I only found out about it when they posted pictures on Instagram. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to go anyway, as I was working in another state for a couple of weeks, but the fact that they didn\u2019t even bother to invite me stings. Since New Year, I\u2019ve tried to organise group and one-on-one catch ups, but have been getting either no response or something along the lines of \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t that day. I\u2019m super busy, but have fun!\u201d with no suggestion that we make another time when they are available. It feels like a brush off. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure what\u2019s going on, other than I seem to be excluded from group catch-ups now, with no explanation. I realised today that I forgot to wish one of the girls a Happy Birthday last month, which is all on me and I feel like an asshole for it, but the exclusionary behaviour started before that. I\u2019m sure it hasn\u2019t helped though. \n\nIt might just be the natural progression of friendship; people grow apart. But I feel like it\u2019s more than that. I\u2019m the only one who isn\u2019t in a serious, long-term relationship or married, and when I started seeing the guy I\u2019m currently with,  I was told off for seeing him twice in one week and not catching up with the group. Never mind that they all have families, in-laws and other friends, and it\u2019s not uncommon for someone to say that they can\u2019t make it to brunch or whatever because they\u2019ve got plans with other people. The whole thing just feels petty and hypocritical. One of them invited me out for coffee, then cancelled at the last minute. It was the same girl who told me I wasn\u2019t being a good friend back in October, and I had a feeling that she was going to sit me down for another guilt trip/telling off, so it was kind of a relief when she cancelled. \n\nI have plenty of other friends, but I\u2019ve been friends with this particular group of girls for almost 15 years and I\u2019d be really sad to lose them as friends. But it feels like I\u2019m in a no win situation. It also feels just like being 14 again, and not getting invited to someone\u2019s party. I feel like I\u2019m being held to a higher standard than the rest of the girls in the group, and that I\u2019m constantly having to prove myself. It\u2019s exhausting, and emotionally draining. \n\nTl;dr - My adult girlfriends are acting like we\u2019re back in high school and excluding me from group activities, accusing me of not pulling my weight as a friend, and holding me to a standard that no one else seems to have to meet. Has anyone else had a similar experience, and how did you navigate it? I\u2019d really like to keep these girls as friends, but I feel like I\u2019m getting to the point that I\u2019ll have to step back, for my own sanity. Any advice would be hugely appreciated!

We met at work and we'd always hang out nearly every Friday by going to dinner, hanging at her house and I'd sometimes spend the weekends there. You get the whole ordeal. \n\nNow that we're older, I moved on from that job 3 years ago, got in a serious relationship with a guy and about to start a new job at the end of the month. She's grown up too, has a boyfriend, about to have her second child but still at the same job. Sure, we've each complained that we don't get to hang like we used to, I'm super busy these days always doing something with my boyfriend, she's busy taking care of her daughter about to have her second, but barely ever has the money or time to do anything.\n\nThe problem? I've tried to make more of an effort to hang out with her and I went to her baby shower last week which was great. She's going through a very tough time right now (mom and boyfriend fight a lot, his mom always has something to say and etc on family drama). I tried to ask if she wanted to have lunch next weekend. Well, next weekend arrived and she never answered my texts or calls. Finally, she gets back to me on Facebook messenger and says \"oh I'm so sorry, I'm at the mall looking for baby stuff.\" I joked with her saying something like how dare you have me worry! Yes, she's not the best at texting or calling back. But normally, she's all in for hanging out with me. Whenever we do make plans, she'll ask the day of an hour or so ahead of time if I'm on my way yet because that's how much she wants to hang out. I feel that part of it is is that she might be mad at me for arriving to her baby shower late even though I told her ahead of time. Even so, she'd tell me.\n\nI understand things change once you have kids, I get it. But I can't even remember the last time we hung out one on one. Her daughter is 2 and can understand words. I want one on one time so we can have real adult conversations! I don't know how to have this conversation without being told \"you know how hard it is to have someone watch her/you know my mom isn't always willing to watch her/the sitter watches her enough.\" She'll also complain she never has enough money to do anything such as lunch like I mentioned but I'm generous enough to not care (money is a whole different story with her) I know it sounds selfish but I miss her! What can I do? I know she sometimes can't always get to her phone because she's busy being a mom.\n\n**TLTR**: Best friend and I don't hang one on one anymore. She seemed to \"forget\" about planning a lunch date today. I love her daughter but one on one would make it so much easier to have adult conversations.

When you post on needafriend, makenewfriendshere, r4r or some other sub that can be used for friendship what are you truly looking for when posting? I'm asking because to be honest a lot of posts I come across are really similar regardless of the sub. I'm not judging people because of that but my question is with subs that have a considerable amount of similar posts why is it difficult to find what your looking for? \n\nQuite a bit of posts mention anime, playing video games, overwatch, wow or other well known games and.... that's just about it usually. When you post are you only looking for friends as you claim or are you  looking for friends but really hoping for some romance on the side? I would like to know regardless of the answer. Or is the problem that a lot of conversations that happen are just bad?\n\nI have accepted that the type of person I'm looking for may not exist on reddit or at all really but I do send pms to people if I am interested or notice they don't appear to be having any luck. The result is usually not good because I foolishly think \"Hmm, this convo might go great maybe.\" and the result is a convo that starts out on life support and I put in almost all the work to keep it going until I get tired of dragging the ship alone and let it die.\n\nOne person's post I responded to and he didn't seem anywhere as near as friendly as his post implied but it was too early to give up but keeping the convo going actually made it worse and he literally said \"I didn't know you were looking for friendship.\" Which is odd because his post said he was looking for someone to talk to. The conversation was already bad enough since he asked me questions that were already answered when I pm'd him but geezus.\n\nI don't really post to subs seeking friendship anymore because I feel like posting is just casting bait into water full of similar fish. \n\nThe problem with posting is that I kinda feel obligated to respond to some people at least even if their response is hmm.. uninspired? I hear a lot of people say girls get more responses and as a lady I can tell you the reason is because a lot of posts from ladies does not completely eliminate being open to the possibility of romance. I made posts before and if I mentioned nothing about romance or mentioned nothing that completely eliminates the possibility for romance I get a lot of responses but when I made posts saying something like \"Not looking for a boyfriend\" or \"romance is very likely to never happen\" I get way less responses than one would think.\n\nJust be open with what you're looking for and know even if you have the most reasonable expectations you still may not find what you're looking for.\n\nMy opinion is most likely very unpopular.

He has explained that he cannot put himself in such a vulnerable position again to be hurt, and he is adamant that he cannot be close to anyone as he always hurts them in some way.

I love him (used to joke that he was my nephew as he's younger than me) and we've been through a lot of stuff emotionally which means that I still want to be connected to him. What makes it difficult is he still wants to be friends, but has made it clear that our relationship can't be what it was. I still desperately want to be there for him and help him, but am I doing a disservice to myself by loving and caring for a person that cannot do the same for me?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I don't know where to post this post about my two shitty friends... so, here am I! Sorry for my bad english... Sorry for the format, I'm using phone... yada yada yada\n\nI was a scrawny, lil nerd when I was little. I'm from Malaysia. School system is really different. This story happened when I was 8 yo. I had 2 'bff'. We kinda inseparable at that time. I was put in the 'genius' class at my school. And I befriended with them.\n\nI was kinda a rich kid at the moment because I had PS2. If u have consoles, u pretty much rich family. So, my friends and I planned to make a ice-blended one evening at my house. So, before we went to school one evening for cocuricullum session, we all met at my house. We planned to do it together but this 2 pig just sat at my sofa and open my tv and ask me to make it for them. P/S : at that time, I was a nerd and didn't know 'how to friend'. And of course I said yes.\n\nThis happened for almost a year. Every Wednesday, for a year. (I was really stupid when I was young).\n\nThat's not it. These 2 pigs came to my house one day and wanted to have a 'study-group'. And I let them in. We 'studied' in my room. One of them saw my PS2 and wanted to play. I set it up and we played. As u all may know, PS2 only had 2 controllers, so, they played while I watch them. When I said that I wanted to play, they hissed at me! TF! I didn't mind at that time because of my stupidity. They played at MY HOUSE from 12.00 a.m. to 4.00 p.m. (Again, I was stupid). Then they went home without thanking me and without study anything! My mon was pretty mad at me. Boohoo.\n\nOne day, one of them came to my house and wanted to study with me. I was like 'Hell yeah! Two of us studying without our 3rd friend'. He came to my house, walk to my room and open my PS2 and played. And it happens again. Suddenly, my friend kick me out of MY OWN ROOM because  'I was noob for the game'. I said okay, and went out. My mom was mad when I told her. But fyi, my mom is a really kind woman. She's really strict to her kids but not others' kids. And she didn't kick my friend out of our house.\n\nSo, apparently my father knew what happened from my mom. And me and my father had a talked. My father didn't like my friend to came over again. The next day, I told my friends that they can't go to my house again. They began to unfriend me. Tell gossips about me. And every stupid spoilt kids would probably did.\n\nSo, I was befriended to more kind friends and they knew what happened between me and the 2 pigs.\n\nSo, if u read this Hazwan and Azrie...... FUCK YOU! I'll see you in hell! U ruin my childhood! F U!", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I know the only help I can give is comfort and support, but is there anything else I can do to help him?", "author": "moongoddess64", "self_text": "Hi people of reddit. Strap in, I tend to ramble. Tl;dr at bottom.\n\nI have a best friend of over a decade now. We are both in college and hang out a lot whenever we are both in our hometown (he lives there, I attend university out of state during the semester). We often talk a lot about all sorts of things and I listen whenever he is having problems, and I know he does and would do the same for me.\n\nHowever, he has recently been bringing up a subject a lot in our conversations and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any way I can help.\n\nHe has bad anxiety and depression (I can relate, as I am on a medication for anxiety and panic attacks) so often how mental illness affects us comes up in conversations. Over the last few years, my friend has had a very hard time holding down jobs. He doesn\u2019t have problems getting jobs (just the same problems everyone has when trying to apply for jobs in our hometown, priority does not lie with college students) but every round of applications he has been accepted by at least one employer, which is great. However, once he starts working there, he can only stay for a short amount of time before he quits because he gets too anxious working there. I think the longest he\u2019s worked somewhere since high school was around half a year?\n\nNow he deals with some other things and certain unfair judgements from people (which I won\u2019t go into detail for privacy\u2019s sake) so it makes sense that he would have more anxiety around working with people who may or may not be open minded or have certain judgements (we live in a fairly liberal city but the rest of the state is very conservative). But, there are great businesses downtown that are accepting of anyone regardless of looks, hairstyle, piercings, tattoos, gender orientation, sexual orientation, basically everything and I feel like he would be a shoe in for employment there, especially as he regularly talks with and networks with the employees there and generally really likes it there.\n\nHowever, even in a more chill employment environment, it seems like it is only a short amount of time before he quits the job out of anxiety. He worked at one coffee shop for only a day! before quitting, citing that memorizing all the coffee drinks was going to be too complicated for him and he couldn\u2019t memorize them all that day. After telling me this, i told him that the last food/drink place I worked at had lots of orders to know too, but no one memorized them until months in because there were so many, that\u2019s what the managers and recipe charts were there for. But it was too late at that point.\n\nHe texted me the other week saying he had just quit another new job again out of anxiety.\n\nNow I worry a lot about him because he already struggles to pay for rent and basic necessities, and has moved place to place to place in order to find affordable rent. He already has tonnes of student loans and might not be allowed back to his school next year because of failing classes, overdue class and rent fees, and if he is allowed back, he will probably lose loans and scholarships. He realizes this too but still can\u2019t seem to stay at his jobs.\n\nEvery time he asks for advice I give him the following:\n\n-look for jobs you\u2019ll enjoy more than the last few you had. If you don\u2019t like food industry jobs, don\u2019t go for those! Figure out what you like and don\u2019t like in a job and apply to those that fit your criteria. Like he doesn\u2019t like the face-to-face interaction of working in food, so I suggested he try an office job or work at a store that is rarely busy, or another job that would have less interactions. There was one he kept wanting to apply to because the store is almost always empty but they still somehow have business and pay their employees well. But he never applied even though he kept saying he wanted to. I even suggested helping him narrow down what he wants in a job but he says he\u2019ll figure that out himself.\n\n-try to stick it out a little longer; if things aren\u2019t going badly at his job (there were some places with toxic work environments that I\u2019m glad he left but others where nothing bothered him particularly about the job but he was just too anxious and left). I don\u2019t think one day at that one work place was enough to figure out if he\u2019d like it there or not.\n\n-talk to your counselor! He sees a counselor regularly so I suggested he bring up this dilemma with her and they try to get to the root of the anxiety surrounding work together. He really likes his counselor and it sounds like she\u2019s really good so he said he\u2019d try that. But every time he\u2019d come back and say they tried to figure something out, but there was nothing so they just addressed the rejections from boys he likes instead. At first I figured the counselor did this for a reason, that could have been a more pressing matter that affected mental health more at the moment. But it\u2019s happened every time since and I\u2019m starting to think that\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want to dig into why he has a hard time working.....\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been talking in circles with the same suggestions every time he comes to me for advice on this and I no longer have any idea what to say to him because I\u2019m starting to sound like a broken record. I know I can\u2019t do anything for him and he has to figure this out on his own time but unfortunately, we need money to have food, water, and shelter and I\u2019m worried because he doesn\u2019t always have money for that. Is there anything at all I can do to help? Thanks for reading.\n\nTl;dr one of best friends is too anxious to work and keeps quitting all his jobs after only a few months, weeks, or even only a day. I am worried because a.) all this quitting is going to make it harder for him to get hired by people in the future and b.) because he\u2019s in debt and hardly has enough money for rent and necessities. He goes to counseling but his counselor is having a hard time working with him to figure this out. Help?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

My close friend knows that he\u2019s into that type of FWB stuff, but when she asked if anything weird happened when we hung out for the \u201cfirst time\u201d (actually my third time \u2639\ufe0f), I told her no because I\u2019m too scared to admit it. The thing is, all my friends know I\u2019m a super shy and reserved person, so telling them this would probably freak them out. My best friend is the only one that knows and she did freak out, but I told her at the beginning so she\u2019s used to it now. But my other close friend is religious and not about this kind of thing, so if I told her she might freak out and maybe get mad that I didn\u2019t tell her (probably not the mad part, she\u2019s pretty chill). She would probably look at me and the guy a little differently or weirdly, since we all have one class together.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? How do I react to this?", "author": "LukerTheDuker", "self_text": "So I've been friends with my best friend for almost 10 years now. (I'm 22, he's 21) It's quite crazy how many things we have in common, we could literally do anything together because we love all the same things. Our families know each other super well, and we do spend a fair amount of time together, just doing typical guy stuff. Being that we get along so well together, we always would see each other more often than your typical friends, I would say. Around a year ago though, my best friend found himself a girl, which is now his girlfriend. It was the first serious relationship of his life, and for some reason it made me so jealous. It didn't help that this girl had some serious manipulative tendencies and many other reasons that people didn't like her, but that's a story for another time...\n\nAnyways, I didn't like her, at all. Maybe it was because she was changing my best friend, maybe it was because I wasn't used to having him share his life with someone else. I had gotten so used to the way that things had been for almost 10 years that I did not take to this change very easily. But why? Shouldn't I be happy that my best friend is happy with someone else? I definitely feel this way with my other friends who have significant others, just not with my best friend... And it did create tons of tension because his girlfriend didn't like me either. Anyways, things are better now in that regard, he keeps her and his friends separate (no one else likes her either) and he spends time with us whenever he can.\n\nI still feel so jealous though whenever he's with her. I am pretty protective of him, and when he had first starting seeing his girlfriend, I would get so upset at whenever she would make him sad for whatever reason. I do feel similar feelings with other friends, but things seem so much more intense with him. And I realized that it might actually be because I might love the guy...\n\nFor me, I've never been attracted to a guy in the past. I've had girlfriends, seen a few girls, and even today find myself attracted to girls and I am trying to get back into the dating game after being out of it for a couple years now. The idea of being attracted to another guy doesn't appeal to me at all. I can appreciate how good looking some guys are, but that's pretty much it. But for some reason, I'm so freakin attached to my best friend. And it's not really sexually, despite sometimes having the urge to cuddle when sharing the same bed, for example, but that's the most that it gets. I just wanna have fun with the guy, laugh, go to bars, restaurants, basketball and hockey games, just spend time doing what we both love.\n\nI have no idea what to do. I know the guy loves me but not more than a friend . I don't know if I even want him to love me like that because I don't even know if I love him like that. I would never try anything because I don't even know if that's what I want, and I know that it would ruin our friendship. Hypothetically speaking, if he were to try something, I don't know that I would say no... But I also feel uncomfortable just thinking about it as well. I'm so confused. I think I might love his companionship, or maybe I love him, I don't know... But the idea of being attracted to guys turns me off. Maybe it's the fact that I haven't been in a real relationship in a few years so I just need anyone by my side, and right now he's the person I'm closest to, I don't know. I just have no clue what to make of all of this.\n\nTL;DR! - I'm super close to my best friend of 10 years. I started to get super jealous once he got his first real girlfriend and realized that it might be because I'm in love with him. However, I have never been attracted to any other guy and even the idea of being with another man is a turn-off for me, and find myself searching for a girlfriend and feeling attracted to women. I don't know if it's just because I'm lonely, or what.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

You know, the kind liable to ask how your day is going out of the middle of nowhere and with whom you can exchange songs, dumb memes and deep discussions. Sometimes all at once. \n\n\n\n*If you are someone who is not going to bother reading the following wall, I encourage you to click the lil' X on top of this tab now. Thank you!* :) \n\n\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info (AKA full autobiography) about me:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate.\n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned career, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, which I am dealing with as best as I can - although recently, things have been on the mend - enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am somewhat stigmatized against the latter by some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not, in fact, a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandise and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed. \n\n- Gainfully *un*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work.\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Automata, WoW, DOOM, Bioshock, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. Honestly, for whatever reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nRight now, I am playing Rimworld on a higher difficulty. It is a journey - our 'scientist' had her arm chopped off because she went berserk from stress and I forgot to switch to unarmed when I had her apprehended.. \n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favourite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favourite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loathe cheap jumpscares they are so enamoured with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n\n- My sense of humour is possibly the worst, and I have dank memes ready for every possible situation and I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile humour. \n\n- My main hobby right now is Airsoft. I spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together since I ordered most of my gear from companies in Russia. I guess I really prefer quality, which is why I was willing to fork over money for real military stuff instead of more affordable replicas.  But at least the gear is quite nice and looks good. \n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I think it is time to give up trying to categorize what I like by genre, and instead do it by what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord) I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n\nRight now, I am super into Ghost, Pain, Marilyn Manson and .. Muse - if it is not obvious by this point, I am so edgy that I (used to) cut myself :D\nHere is a song that I like so much that I will listen to it on [repeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zx1ZtxUbGE) until I hate it. \n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%, due to a certain affinity for slithering neck-ties and positive human qualities like ambition, narcissism and general douchebaggery :D \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. Stuf like lack o punctuatuion impropar gramar to short n generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit.\n\nAlso, here are some pictures of [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), because why not? \n\n Please no Reddit Chats, I hate the UI. \n\nFeel free to hit me with your favorite ice breaker / shower question!

Whether the plans have been long term or short term, I keep trying to call them to meet up, and often get told that they're either busy or taking a rain check, or equivalents, to go and hang out with a different (specific) friend. Recently this has even started happening with plans we set up long in advance (last week they called off an outing we'd planned about three months ago, which I took time off work for). While we stay in contact through text and facebook, and still communicate on a fairly regular basis, I haven't actually gotten the chance to meet up and do anything with them for a very long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday they asked to take a rain check on another hangout, and I found myself biting back several retorts that I mercifully realized before sending them, were filled with jealousy, and possibly even resentment (many were to the effect of: \"Hanging out with \\[friend\\] I'm guessing?\"). It served as a wake up call, and I feel like a complete jerk for thinking this way.  I've asked them if I've done anything that upset them or made them feel awkward or uncomfortable around me, and they've assured me multiple times that we're fine, but I cannot shake these feelings of jealousy that I'm afraid could damage the friendship, and I don't know how to discuss this topic with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone could provide some advice for how I can move forward and resolve this without damaging this friendship, I would be deeply appreciative.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I have family in hospital and a high stress job, no time, and sometimes I just want to have a nice happy convo. It\u2019s always a convo about her saying how stressed she is bc she thinks she has cancer when 20 docs tell her she doesn\u2019t.

I was clearly kidding and just trying to get her to not think so negatively.\nShe got mad at my real advice which was about her money struggles, like you could always do Uber, poshmark, postmates stuff like that for side money but she just yells that I have bad advice.

{"post_id": "axr351", "created_utc": 1551824543, "title": "18 [M4R] US - You see a Reddit post, you click on it, and...", "author": "Alienwit", "self_text": "Sorry, I haven't written that far yet. \ud83d\ude43 \n\nHi, potential friend! Thank you for clicking on my post. I've been struggling a lot with life and I feel very lonely, so I thought I'd try this subreddit again. I found my best friend in here, and I know all of you can find significant people too. I'd love to have emotional support from someone and also give it in return. I'm looking for friends around my age (+2/-2) hopefully in the US or Canada due to timezone and ping reasons. I'm very selective with people since my time is limited, and I want a long-term intimate friendship, not a superficial trade of hi's and bye's like most people do. If you don't put effort in a friendship, don't expect me to do the same. I've met many people who are indifferent, and it sucks. I love people who are passionate about things like me, who are open minded and creative, and who like to discuss deep topics. It's even better if you share some of my interests, as that makes bonding easier. Now that I've specified what I'm looking for, I'll introduce myself!\n\n**Interests**\n\n* Vidyagames - I've played games my whole life, and I know every single one of them. RPGs, MMOs, Bullet Hells, FPS, Puzzle, Strategy, Platformers, Roguelikes, Metroidvanias, MOBAs, Sandboxes, Rhythm, Emulators; I've played every single genre. If you play something, chances are I have played it too. If you know what Touhou is, you'll be automatically cool.\n* Music - I have a *very* broad taste in music, and one of my dreams is to be a music composer one day. Classical, Jazz, Rock, Metal, and Videogame/Anime soundtracks are my favorite genres. If I were to talk about my favorite musicians this post would never end, but I'll mention the ones I listen to the most to give you an idea: Yoshihisa Hirano, Toby Fox, literally any classical composer, Danny Baranowsky, ZUN, and Yuki Kajiura. Music is my biggest passion, and I'd love to share my songs with someone. I also own a Violin and a Harmonica, although my favorite instrument is the Piano and I dream of playing it again (I'm too poor to afford one).\n* Anime - I don't watch anime as much as I used to given that Crunchyroll has such a small selection and other sites are illegal and risky, but I've watched a lot of anime in my life. My favorites are Death Note, Hunter x Hunter, Madoka Magica, Code Geass, Cowboy Bebop, Serial Experiments Lain, Steins;Gate, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Akame ga Kill, Monster and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni.\n* Literature - I've always been an avid reader, although lately I haven't read much due to stress. My favorite authors so far are H. P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe, William Shakespeare, George Orwell, and Ray Bradbury. \n* Computer Science - I got accepted into college for this major, so expect me to be devoted to it in the future. Right now since I have lots of free time I'm studying Java early to be ready for my first course, as my college is very competitive. I'd love to find someone who also plans to major in this or at least has interest in it, as it's quite hard and boring to study alone.\n* Philosophy - I tend to meditate a lot upon deep subjects that not many people care to think about. While I don't have time to seriously study it and my current knowledge is vague, I'm aware of the different schools of philosophy and the prominent philosophers. Like Socrates said, I know that I know nothing. I'm very open minded and love intellectual discussions with solid arguments.\n* Horror - It calms me, I don't know why. ~~I'm not a psychopath I promise.~~\n* Memes - They aren't as good as they used to be before the Fortnite/TikTok nation attacked, but I used to be a dedicated memer back in the days. If you know 4chan, Twitch, old YouTube, or NicoNico memes, you've gained my respect.\n* Food - I love all kinds of food and I'd love to be a chef one day.\n\n**Things about me**\n\n* I'm very pale, I weigh 114 pounds (being slim is great), I have green eyes and dark brown hair, and I'm assaulted by the obscure evil curse called acne.\n* I'm an INTP and Cancer.\n* My favorite weather is rain/snow and my favorite season is winter.\n* I might be an alien, shh.\n* I love cooking and my friends say my recipes look delicious.\n* I love all animals --they are much more pure and innocent than hoomans-- but mostly cats and spiders!\n* I was homeschooled by myself through high school, and I'm currently waiting to attend college in the fall.\n* I'm a Hikikomori.\n* I self-taught English as it's not my native language. \n* I have a 3.85 GPA and 29 ACT composite score, it's not the best but despite that I think I'm intelligent.\n* I love Dr Pepper.\n* I was bullied all my life, and I suffer from severe depression and social anxiety, so please bear with me.\n\nMy preferred platform is Discord, as I don't use anything else, so please be ready to talk there. And now, to close this post and make sure you read it, I'll ask a fun question! *If you were granted a single wish, what would you wish for? (Wishing for more wishes will not work here XD)*\n\nThank you a lot for reading this, have a nice day/night!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I\u2019m not really an interesting person nor have to many hobbies but I enjoy:\n\n1.Watching hockey and keeping up with trades/injury news as well (Fuck senators managements they honesty got rid of there top players at the trade deadline fire sale they had, seriously does the management even want to be competitive in the league? Or continue to be a farm team for everyone else??????? #MelnykOut) I yeah it\u2019s been a while since the trade deadline but wtf were you thinking Ottawa. \n\n2. I really enjoy fishing during the summer, and geese and deer hunting in the fall, I know for a lot of people they don\u2019t like to talk about it so I won\u2019t bring it up unless you ask me to or are interested in it as well. (Please no political or moral debates)\n\n3. I enjoy gaming as well, I mostly play simulators like farming simulator or euro truck simulator 2, but I also enjoy first person shooters as well once in a while mainly games like rising storm 2 Vietnam or Squad. I have been recently started playing Factorio also and so far that\u2019s have been a ton of fun. I do have a ps4 but only really play red dead redemption or nhl 19 on it.\n\n4. I\u2019m really into guns. Like I absolutely LOVE guns. Hell if I could marry my first handgun I\u2019ve bought I would be all for it. I can spend hours talking about them, learning history about them and shooting them at the range.

So I\u2019m already afraid and nervous before you have even said a word. (Sounds fun eh?) \n\nI also like talking about hemp oils as I feel like that is something that helps me with my social anxiety and my mood in general as I feel like my anxiety of talking to people seems to be the largest cause of depression that I tend to get once in a while. \n\n\nI would also prefer to stay talking on the Reddit app for until we get to know each other a bit better \n\n\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

This extended into her family hating me and the significant others shes had since then have all blocked me on social media.

I waited many years for my eldest to be old enough to talk about this with but he\u2019d rather talk football and play fortnite lol \n\nI\u2019m shy around other people I\u2019ve been told I have social anxiety and ptsd from a previous relationship that didn\u2019t go well. \n\nI love gaming I have a Xbox one and a PS4, love reading comics and trying to get into anime lol love watching let\u2019s play YouTube videos and can spend al day on there rewatching my favourite moments from my favourite tv shows I.e supernatural, doctor who, walking dead, the cw superhero shows. Getting into audible so I can listen to something while I\u2019m gaming. Also love collecting comics and figures and of course I have a nasty obsession with pop figures lol \ud83d\ude06 \n\nDon\u2019t know what else to say but would be nice to make some friends to just talk random crap with and have a laugh with. Must have a cracking sense of humour and don\u2019t mind being sent memes. Sorry but don\u2019t want to end up feeling like a pedo so 25+, M or F \n\nSo drop a message or whatever I guess or not up to you I\u2019m M/32 \n\nMy discord is Neon Reaper#6788", "subreddit": "friendship"}

We hung out every day for a while and it was great for both of us. He moved his computer into my apartment so we could play games and we would go to the gym literally every day. I spent Christmas at his house and his family even gave me gifts. Around January, he started getting overwhelmed and I didn't pick up on it and he held it in for a while until it boiled over. Three days before our blowout, he said \"i can't express how much I appreciate all that you've done for me and what a great friend you've been and I need to show that better\". Needless to say, I was blindsighted when I came home from work one night and his computer was gone and he said that he needed space. We spoke together in person about it the next day and he said that our friendship wasn't over, that he cared for me, etc. but he needs to find balance in his life. We had a few more issues relating to the same thing over the next few days and now he isn't replying to me or anything.\n\nThis has been a problem of mine my whole life-- i tend to go all in on friendships and they begin mutually, but they end because of my clinginess.\n\n\nI think it's because I likely have very mild Asperberger's and I have always struggled to make friends. When I do find a friend, I tend to try too hard to keep them happy because I don't want to end up spending another full year in my room playing video games alone.\n\n\nAssuming my friend is willing to give me another shot, do I just not text him or reach out to him at all and wait for him to come to me?

{"post_id": "ay0486", "created_utc": 1551886573, "title": "Confusing friendship", "author": "mrme5251", "self_text": "So a few months ago I made a new friend. We were both looking for someone to be close to who understood the importance of being able to share feelings and deep stuff. But also just enjoy playing, talking and chilling. We have only been talking via chat and voice so far.\n\nI didn't have any expectations whatsoever at first and let her take things(our friendship) wherever she wanted it to go. We spent hours a day playing games, talking and chilling. She quickly started sharing deeper stuff and I aswell. We also took our friendship further and kept a lot of contact and added me on social media quickly and elsewhere. I didn't really expect any of this. And she said how she really enjoyed everything about us quickly and how I was fun and interesting etc.\n\nI was ofcourse happy about it and said I appreciate our friendship a lot too. She cared a lot and was very nice. She always checked if small things like the music in the background was no too loud, made sure to reply to my messages, be considerate and wish me well back etc.. She always contacted me, and I did too for while. But she has a lot less time than me and works a lot so, generally I let her keep asking since when I ask she is usually very busy.\n\nIn the beginning we said that we could meet if we kept talking and everything seemed good, which it did so I asked her to meet sometime. She said we'll see after christmas, but she never brought it up again(even though she really wanted to meet up).  Then she mentioned something about it 2 weeks later and I asked again if she wanted to meet since she forgot about it. Then she just said, if u want to nothing more. \n\nBy this point though she we stopped playing games, but talking a lot anyways and stuff. We shared more deep stuff and she shared a bit deep stuff now and then about her life she needed someone to listen to. Then a few weeks later she mentioned some trouble she was having and said we haven't met because of being afraid of how I would see her after meeting. So we decided to make plans the next day. She then \"forgot\" about it and I asked, she had gotten sick and said she couldn't make plans. I asked a week later when she was better, but apparently too sick to make plans. Then I waited another two weeks and still she didn't say anything which she said she would. I asked and she said we'll look into it on day x, for potentially meeting on day z or day y. The point being she kept saing we'll see about it at that date and saying she wants to meet every time.\n\nSo she didn't say anything on day x, and I asked about how thigns were looking. She was online and got the message(i know), but didn't answer for the whole day. So after having spoken a bit I asked why she didn't reply and then she said she was busy tomorrow, but we could see tomorrow about the next day. She forgot to say anything until bedtime that day too, even though we spoke for a few hours. So I asked again about it, she was too busy apparently but didn't care mentioning it anyways. This was 1.5 months after we first agreed to look up a date to meet.\n\nI then 2 days later asked her about her avoiding talking about meeting even though she said time upon time we were gonna meet and choose a date to meet up. She seemed kind of mad that I expressed how I felt about her just avoiding it despite saying we'd look into it. She said she is very busy unlike me, but we have spoken for hours a lot of days where we surely could have met over the last 1.5 months. Is it me who understood things wrong here, or am I doing something wrong here?\n\nAlso recently she always invites me to talk on skype with one of her friends. And she usually talks a lot more to that guy then and kind of excludes me sometimes, but she seems to not notice. I mentioned it sometime and she says it is my fault and that im insecure and quiet(which i am not). I even think it is weird she wanted to get to know me but always adds all her friends in one single conversation(we don't know eachother). Isn't that a bit weird? Not even asking one of us if it is okay. She seems to want things to revolve around her, I think this is a bit strange or am I confused? And says she is nice for inviting me to talk with them.\n\nRecently we have been playing some games and we were supposed to play alone and I bought a game because she convinced me we were gonna play alone and build in a certain way. Then some guy in the chat started saying how hot she is and making himself her slave and now she forgets about me and without asking me invites him and start making plans with him about our gameplay without me. Also recently I managed to get her to get her SO to join us. Since then it went from being temporary kill gameplay instead of building, to permanently abandoning what we were doing before and excluding me from decisions and being mad at me for no reason when playing. Also inviting the \"slave\" guy she met in chat, while ignoring me.\n\nI told her about this and asked and suddenly she blames me, twists what I am saying making me seem illogical. Also told her about this meeting up thing again. She then why can't I just be happy with how things are and if we reach that point we'll reach that point. Even though she clearly stated we were gonna meet a long time ago and reached that point. Also asked if she wants to be friends or if I should be afraid of loosing our friendship, well that made her real mad at me. She said I have to change and become better and I accepted what she said because it seemed to make sense or I was afraid of making her mad. I realize it really didn't make sense afterwards.\n\nAlso if she jokes around with me being stupid or something and I do it back just for fun she gets mad. Sometimes I also used to get quiet when she excluded me and she still uses that as an argument even though it doesn't happen anymore. \n\nIn the beginning she said I was fun and stuff, and now she says im kind of not(not in a direct way) but still says she want me there and likes talking to me.\n\nOnce she said how she was afraid meeting her would make me not want to be friend with her, and I said something similar two times now and she says she is tired of me needing reassurance when she herself seems to need it.\n\nI am very confused about everything, is it me doing something wrong here im being very nice to her overall, more than her but thats okay. When I asked her about this stuff she said all she do is to include me all the time and I am quiet(which is not true anymore, because she used that as an argument b4). As if she has to include me instead of her wanting me there to talk. She argues in circles. Gets mad for small things like not understanding a joke or when doing something she did to me. I feel confused, am I?\n\nLike what is happening? She is great in many ways, but she kind of convinces she is right all the time and gets mad when not being right or loosing. I still like her though. However the first month she was nothing like this.. Also a lot more considerate..", "subreddit": "friendship"}

And then her friend told her about that and she got really mad at me, not for what I said but for the fact that \"I asked questions about her behind her back\". Next couple of days were really tense, she did everything to get on my nerves, spammed our group chat like never before, got close to the guys she never really was close with and other things like once she said she is in a relationship with a guy that she was never interested in. Later she cooled down and things went back to normal for a couple of days, when suddenly she told me to \"stop following her\" when I was just looking for a place to sit down to in college. She apologized to me a day later but form this point situation got a little bit tense, she rarely spoke to me in person and usually tried to avoid me, yet she still was texting me. After some time I've decided it's time to talk about that, I've asked if I somehow got her angry again and she only responded that she got hurt and still needs more time, than I asked if I can do something to fix this and she said she doesn't know, than I admitted that propably we'll never go back to the state of things that were before and than she told that \"maybe some day\", than she added that she still thinks I want something more with her, so to smooth out situation I told her that I don't want anything more than friendship. And past this point everything went nuts. She stopped texting me completely, got even more distant and suddenly started talking about this boyfriend even more. Yet there are times when she still wants to do projects with me, sometimes talks to me but only after a while being among common friends. Later we didn't see each other for 3 weeks because of winter holidays, and after that time I noticed something strange, for example for a person that supposedly got a boyfriend recently she looks very sad, she stopped coming to college even more frequently, I noticed that she started observing me from the distance, sometimes she tries to come near me but in the end she escapes somewhere else, and one day she talks to me a little bit but usually tries to avoid me. My close friends told me that she's overreacting this a lot, and noone including myself can't figure out what the hell is going on. I would be glad if someone finally told me what the hell is this all about because it's tiring.

So these past few months have been difficult for me, first of all i realized that I was in love with my friend, I told him and he has no problem with that and he told me that we will always be brothers. So recently he had a girlfriend, she would always be at our dorm and sleep here and I started getting annoyed and jealous, like a week or two ago they broke up because of me. His girlfriend saw me depressed and asked him about it and he told her the truth, she then decided to go out with this other guy and it didn't work out. Now my friend and that girl are friends with benefits and she's always here again.\n\nSo 2 days ago I asked my friend if she can leave and he told her to leave, but my friend told me he was going to move into her dorm, he was going to be around less now. Around that time I acted hostile to him because i somehow tricked myself into thinking that he was doing this on purpose to hurt me since he knows how I fell and stuff. I was wrong, yesterday we talked about it and I felt guilty so I apologized and told him that he doesn't need to move and she can come back, so yesterday night she stayed over but those feelings of jealousy are coming back. I've been getting annoyed because he does everything in her favour now, one example is that he made some food and burned some of it and have me gave me the burned one, my problem is that he ignored me when I said I wanted the non burned steak and gave it to her. Another example is that he litteraly skipped a whole day of class to take her to this doctor for anxiety and stuff, and I got pissed because he told me he has no time to help me.\n\nAnyways I'm failing my classes and stopped caring  about going, been depressed for weeks now and I've been thinking about dropping out so I can keep my distance, I feel like there is something wrong going on and he's not telling me.

I have been through a lot of stress in my life and after my parents long awaited divorce  I moved out of my initial home last year and started living on my own. Becoming an adult cold turkey wasn't very easy, but here I am, most of my dishes clean, my finances somewhat figured out and I eat vegetables and fruit on a very regular basis.   \nOther information that might be very useful:  \n\n\nI am an ENFJ, if you are interested in that sort of specification of my personality. Also Scorpio with Taurus moon and Leo rising for all my astrology ppl out there.  And though I don't give too much about these sorts of things - I love people, I see myself as a natural born friend and nothing makes me happier and more fullfilled than seeing others grow and overcome their struggles. Also I am a bit lovey dovey when it comes to my friends and shower them in cheesy pickup lines, compliments and questionable puns.  \nI spend a lot of time playing **videogames** (Pok\u00e9mon, Minecraft, League of Legends, Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, The Legend of Zelda, Fire Emblem, The Elder Scrolls Series, Fallout 3 &amp; 4) and reading **books** (just finished Jordan B. Peterson's \"12 Rules for life\"). **Education** in general is probably the one thing consuming most of my time - I am a **history** nerd, meme enthusiast, I love **psychology** and I even enjoy my fair share of **philosophy** and other types of **literature**, such as poetry. I listen to a lot of different artists and bands, my favourites are Florence + the machine, Sia, Queen, The Beatles, Pink Floyd and I do have a soft spot for kpop.   \nLastly I am into a lot of different **series and movies** such as Star Wars, ATLA&amp;LOK, Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Riverdale, Sherlock, Criminal Minds, Dr. Who, The Lord of the Rings &amp; The Hobbit, a bunch of different Disney movies and some **anime** as well.   \n\n\nI hope you all will find what you're looking for.  \n\nMy DM's and chat is open, though I can also offer Discord! \n\nShort Edit: I think it's nice and charming how many young men are texting me who's post history indicates they are having a high level of testosterone they really wanna share.

Why don't I try fixing it you may ask? I honestly love staying up until late at night... Getting up in the morning is a different story though.\n* Aaand there's is probably quite a bit more stuff that I can't remember right now, but I'm sure you'll discover those as we talk more\n\nAll I'm looking for is for someone who actually wants to talk and doesn't just reply with one or two words.

I\u2019m not his best friend either I\u2019m his (But we would be college best friends if that existed), but he often decides to sticks with me rather than other people.\n\nIn our school a lot of people flat share, like a LOT. So as we where good friends I asked him and he seemed kinda interested.\n\nSo the first act begin in January of this year, haven\u2019t seen him in a while (school break). When we finally get in touch I learn that he plans on flat share with two other people (he didn\u2019t told me directly, I had to ask questions to figure it out). So needless to say I\u2019m kind of pissed, even more that he did this in a shady way. \nWhen I confront him about it he said that I thought I wasn\u2019t interested, i told him I was and still am, he says that he can\u2019t go back because he committed himself now. He could have called my to ask if I still was interested before making the decision.\nYet, as painful as it is I decide not to blame him for it. He adds that I could stay with him as they\u2019re going to have a large house where I could hang out, and will live very close to where I currently live. So we spent the following weeks like we used to, neither of us mentioning the flat share, and I\u2019m glad we don\u2019t.\n\nFast forward to today, I was slowly accepting what happened in January and we were still pretty good friends, still staying together, being close, blah blah. I learn from one of our acquaintances (we\u2019re both not that close from her) that they plan to move together with two other people, when she casually reminded him to call his parent for their approval. \n\nHe did not tell me again, I learned it from another person that my friend. And he acted like if nothing appended (not sure if he realized i got the info), then again he sat with me rather than the people he intend to flat share with for the whole year, all will I was trying to hide my anxiety and questioning my life decisions. The  I went home and chugged half a tablet of antidepressant with some alcool so I could pass out and stop thinking about it.\n\nNote that they plan to live with the said girl and two other people including one who dislikes me for whatever reasons, so the whole \u201cyou could stay at the flat all the times anyways\u201d will be difficult.\n\nHelp, what the fuck his wrong, is it me ?

Except now I don\u2019t know if she actually likes me anymore? She still asks me over and we meet up but then she will do things like not invite me out with the rest of our friendship group or make plans then ghost me when I ask her what time. Like for example the other day she insisted just us go to a particular place (even when our other two friends suggested we all go to the arcade) but when that day came around she ignored my messages asking when she wanted to meet and it turned out she had gone bowling with the rest of our friends!! After SHE insisted we do what SHE wanted! Not only that but she didn\u2019t apologise or even tell when I saw her next and it turned out our other friends told her to text me (whichever she didn\u2019t) and she lied and said I didn\u2019t reply!! (I know this cause my friend told me in psssimg that they had gone and was confused when I said I don\u2019t know cause they thought I had been invited) Then yesterday she was reading me bits of her diary that were funny and I saw at the end of a page about a different night out \u201cI\u2019m glad (my name) didn\u2019t come\u201d.

Might make stuff awkward. UGH. Also the whole issue that my friendship group consists of her and people she introduced me to or (that we me right at the same time, but she lives in the same block as them) or people moving away in like two months.

I am a 28 year old woman and I went back to school to study engineering. I am in a really small program, and the niche of my industry is also really small. So relationships matter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll try to keep this concise. A friend of mine (we'll call him Dan), 6/7 years my junior, and I rekindled our friendship after I had been gone for a while (moved out of the country for a year). We start hanging out, and bonded over some difficult issues we shared. I find out his girlfriend broke up with him (we'll call her Jan, she's 21/22 I think), 2 months prior. I thought they were still together, she and I were friends before I had left. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProfessor tells me to talk to her about an internship at a place she interned. I saw her and asked her what it was like working there and how she got the internship. Found out she still worked there, and she acted really standoffish with me. Thought it was weird, but maybe just didn't want me encroaching on her job-- not that I was trying to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery time I saw her after, she became increasingly more hostile towards me, meanwhile my friendship with Dan is getting stronger-- but PURELY PLATONIC, plus he just moved \\*literally\\*  to the other side of the country. Well, you can guess where this goes. She apparently thought we were sleeping together because some guy (I don't know him, but he's friends with both of them) started that rumor. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDan has told Jan numerous times that we never slept together, but Jan continues to have her irrational disdain for me and act with animosity towards me. Also, I should mention their relationship was highly toxic, she was manipulative and hypocritical (she cheated on him but was furious with him for sexting a girl AFTER she broke up with him, and she did a lot of manipulative things to him.) Dan has also told me about how she doesn't like me, but wants the two of us to get along because he's still \"in love\" with her (read co-dependent). Has also told me that she's pissed that I'm coming on a university organized industry trip.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, next I see her, she shoulders me as she walks past me...like are you fucking kidding me? Are we 13? And then another \"friend\", 21 years old, let's call him Ben, tells me again about how much she doesn't like me, and this is when I find out where the rumor started, and that apparently she thought I was \"banging her ex and asking for a recommendation from her job.\" All bullshit. Alllllll fucking bullshit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I call Dan, upset because I'm getting the flack from the fall out of his shitty relationship. And Dan pulls a real dick move and reaches out to Ben, Jan, and the dude who started the rumor. Blowing this up in my face. Now Ben is not talking to me, and he had hired me to do a job for him, which I guess is now not happening-- so I'm out a friend and money. Jan sends me this manipulative message: \"Alrighty dude would you like to meet up briefly and discuss what's going on? I'm really not one for drama and I think this is already blowing out proportion. If anything, Dan is at work right now and this situation does not merit affecting his experience there, which, if you are truly his friend, you will agree with.\"\n\nFirst of all, alrighty dude? Give me a break. Secondly, she's not one for drama? She started this whole thing. Blowing out of proportion? Who do you think blew it (hint, her and Dan)? Thirdly, I didn't know Dan was at work when I called him, and she wants to pin that manipulative BS on me...it was a less than a 2 minute call, and how many times do you wanna guess her crap affected him at work? How many times do you think I picked up the pieces while she treated him like shit and I offered him advice cuz I've been there a few more times than him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen Dan messages me \"I'm sorry I turned it into a shit storm. I think everyone needs to chill for a few days and we can all be cool.\" Ya sure did turn it into a shit storm. And how fucking naive are you? No one is going to be cool. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo obviously these people are immature and not real friends, I'm pissed for being dragged into this high school drama, my instinct is to not engage and walk away. But the program is small. The industry is small. Ben and Jan are both on this trip to the city where Dan lives. There's only 20 of us going. My reputation is at stake, my ability to make the most out of this trip is as well. All because bitchy-Jan wants to believe I slept with her EX when I NEVER did.

I haven't watched her channel in a while, and thanks to something my daddy sent me, it kinda got me in the mood to watch her stuff again.\n\nLets see, who else do I watch that some of you guys may know? Oh yeah, Nostalgia Critic, Minutephysics, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, ATFW, GoodbadFlix, and Cinemassacre.\n\nOh yeah and funny dog and cat videos, can't leave those out.\n\nHmm, other things you should know about me? Oh yeah. This might cause some of you to laugh, but I have a huge thing for Rowan Atkinson. So, if you bring to the table anything related to that, then that is sure to get my attention.\n\nIn fact, I had a friend not too long ago ask me on the scale of wanting to have fun with one of his characters which one would be on top. So, I guess I can go through the list here with you guys..\n\n1. Blackadder \\[season 3.\\]  \n2. Blackadder \\[season 2\\]  \n3. Johnny English  \n4. Any of his Priest characters.  \n5. Rufus from Love Actually  \n6. Mr. Bean. I have him low on the list because lets face it. Bean is way too innocent and child like for any of that stuff.\n\nWell, I hope that you found amusing and gave you a good laugh.\n\nBut, if I sound like someone that you would like to talk to, just leave me a message.\n\nI don't have kik and I don't have skype, so don't bother.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

This Is Going to Be a Bit of a Story, Brace Yourself :(", "author": "LieutenantLowBattery", "self_text": "**Edit:** The title of the post is dumb. Please ignore it. \n\nReddit is a big place filled with all kinds of people, so I don't know who will reply. If you're a mean-spirited person, please go away.\n\nIn, I believe, November of 2017, I posted on r/depression about being lonely and having no friends. I said that I'd never had a friend who truly cared about me.\n\nThere were a few replies, but one person and I really clicked. Her name was Melissa, and she was a lot older than me. She was 27 (she's either 28 or 29 now).\n\nWe became really good friends, and we trusted each other with literally any information. We could talk to each other about anything, and we did. Almost every single day, in fact. We remained close friends (I could have easily called her my best friend, and I did) until November of 2018. She started having health problems. I can't remember the details, but she had to have surgery. She got really sick, and on top of that, her bank account got hacked and she also lost access to her Instagram account. Her and I didn't talk for a long time.\n\nI called and texted her (she had given me her number) **several** times. Finally, someone replied, but it wasn't her. It was some random person who was now using her number. They said that other people had also been calling and texting thinking it was Melissa, but the number belonged to this stranger now.\n\nI actually felt like I was about to have a heart attack. I remember feeling that way. It was incredibly painful. I had a panic attack and started crying for a long time, I can't remember how long.\n\nLuckily, the stranger was given Melissa's new number by one of her friends. This was so relieving.\n\nI talked to her after a long time, and she was okay... but she wasn't talking to me all the time like we used to. It was more on-and-off now... it was different. She told me she was experiencing a lot of depression and that she had been isolating herself.\n\nThen I lost contact with her again. I found her sister on Instagram and DM'd her, telling her that I was concerned, and she somehow got ahold of Melissa and then Melissa decided to reply to my concerned email. The last thing she said to me was that she would talk to me later and that she couldn't talk now. That was on February 6th, and it's march 6th now. It's been a month.\n\nI've sent two emails since then saying that I miss her, but she hasn't responded. I feel like I'm paranoid, or that I've gotten overly attached and obsessed... but she's literally my only friend. I want to say that she feels closer than a friend- more like a family member, but I kinda had a crush on her so that wouldn't be right...\n\nI've opened up to her about every insecurity and struggle I've ever had, and now I don't know what's going on with her. I don't know why she's making it so hard to stay in touch. She doesn't use Instagram anymore, and her number rings but it has no voicemail... it just beeps after ringing three times like some sort of glitched-out business phone.\n\nMy best friend is gone... probably.\n\nShe disappeared... probably.\n\nAnd I don't know if I'll ever be able to talk to her again... she could be dead for all I know.\n\nNow... I'm all socially isolated again. Thoughts of suicide are returning after two years and she was the one that kept me from doing it.\n\nI've never been able to comfortably socialize with someone of my own sex for some reason. I've always been slightly intimidated by guys and I'm not sure why. I can only open up and be sensitive around girls... I'm a malfunctioned teenager.\n\nI could go on and on about things, but this post is too long. I want to go to sleep and never wake up.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I debated even posting this. I opened and closed this tab about a half dozen times with the belief that either nobody would respond or they would respond but I'd be too off-putting for them. Rather than just accept a defeat that hasn't even happened, here we go.\n\nI'm very bad at talking about myself in a positive way. Basically I'm the type of person that I wouldn't want to hang out with. If I had clones we'd all probably hate each other. That's not to say I'm totally pessimistic though. Just mostly.\n\nI have a few friends, but I really only talk to one person on a daily basis. Two more on a near-daily basis. Despite this, I realized I really have nothing in common with anyone. Yet somehow we're friends, so I must be doing something right.\n\nI'm pretty open about most things, although there are some things I'd rather not talk about up front. But I would much rather just not tell you something than lie to you about anything. I try to lie as little as possible, even about bad things. So if you're the type of person that embellishes your life to make yourself sound more interesting, we probably won't get along.\n\nI wasn't sure if I should type a whole bunch in order to make it look like I'm someone worth knowing or type something brief. Then again if I type too much there are those people that will see all that text and just close this page and move on. So I guess it doesn't really matter which decision I make.\n\nThere's not much that's fascinating about me. Most of the funny stories and events of my life happened 10 or more years ago. So if you want to hear about the time I got hit in the head with a metal baseball bat or the time I lost a spelling bee because I had to pee, sure. Just know that asking \"what did you do today\" will almost always have an extremely boring answer.\n\nI'm one of the 7 people on this planet that still enjoys baseball. I used to watch a lot of movies but these days I mainly just watch the MCU stuff. I listen to such an odd and wide array of music that you'll probably be extremely confused by my Spotify library. Not in a hipster \"you haven't heard them before\" way but rather \"none of these songs sound remotely similar in any way\".\n\nI like dogs but I have a pet cat. I'm very likely to try any food or drink at least once, especially if it's spicy food. It's actually gotten to a point where if my food isn't spicy I can't really taste anything. I should probably see a doctor about that.\n\nI love video games but I suck at them and I'm a broke bitch so I usually stick to games I already own and very rarely play new releases.\n\nI can't think of anything else worth saying right now so I'm going to post this and tab out and probably be too nervous and anxious to look back at reddit for a few hours so I guess I might see you then unless the highlighted mail symbol stresses me out too much.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

{"post_id": "ayd64g", "created_utc": 1551968892, "title": "Confusing friendship", "author": "mrme5251", "self_text": " \n\nSo  a few months ago I made a new friend. We were both looking for someone  to be close to who understood the importance of being able to share  feelings and deep stuff. But also just enjoy playing, talking and  chilling. We have only been talking via chat and voice so far.\n\nI  didn't have any expectations whatsoever at first and let her take  things(our friendship) wherever she wanted it to go. We spent hours a  day playing games, talking and chilling. She quickly started sharing  deeper stuff and I aswell. We also took our friendship further and kept a  lot of contact and added me on social media quickly and elsewhere. I  didn't really expect any of this. And she said how she really enjoyed  everything about us quickly and how I was fun and interesting etc.\n\nI  was ofcourse happy about it and said I appreciate our friendship a lot  too. She cared a lot and was very nice. She always checked if small  things like the music in the background was no too loud, made sure to  reply to my messages, be considerate and wish me well back etc.. She  always contacted me, and I did too for while. But she has a lot less  time than me and works a lot so, generally I let her keep asking since  when I ask she is usually very busy.\n\nIn  the beginning we said that we could meet if we kept talking and  everything seemed good, which it did so I asked her to meet sometime.  She said we'll see after christmas, but she never brought it up  again(even though she really wanted to meet up).  Then she mentioned  something about it 2 weeks later and I asked again if she wanted to meet  since she forgot about it. Then she just said, if u want to nothing  more.\n\nBy this point though she we  stopped playing games, but talking a lot anyways and stuff. We shared  more deep stuff and she shared a bit deep stuff now and then about her  life she needed someone to listen to. Then a few weeks later she  mentioned some trouble she was having and said we haven't met because of  being afraid of how I would see her after meeting. So we decided to  make plans the next day. She then \"forgot\" about it and I asked, she had  gotten sick and said she couldn't make plans. I asked a week later when  she was better, but apparently too sick to make plans. Then I waited  another two weeks and still she didn't say anything which she said she  would. I asked and she said we'll look into it on day x, for potentially  meeting on day z or day y. The point being she kept saing we'll see  about it at that date and saying she wants to meet every time.\n\nSo  she didn't say anything on day x, and I asked about how thigns were  looking. She was online and got the message(i know), but didn't answer  for the whole day. So after having spoken a bit I asked why she didn't  reply and then she said she was busy tomorrow, but we could see tomorrow  about the next day. She forgot to say anything until bedtime that day  too, even though we spoke for a few hours. So I asked again about it,  she was too busy apparently but didn't care mentioning it anyways. This  was 1.5 months after we first agreed to look up a date to meet.\n\nI  then 2 days later asked her about her avoiding talking about meeting  even though she said time upon time we were gonna meet and choose a date  to meet up. She seemed kind of mad that I expressed how I felt about  her just avoiding it despite saying we'd look into it. She said she is  very busy unlike me, but we have spoken for hours a lot of days where we  surely could have met over the last 1.5 months. Is it me who understood  things wrong here, or am I doing something wrong here?\n\nAlso  recently she always invites me to talk on skype with one of her  friends. And she usually talks a lot more to that guy then and kind of  excludes me sometimes, but she seems to not notice. I mentioned it  sometime and she says it is my fault and that im insecure and  quiet(which i am not). I even think it is weird she wanted to get to  know me but always adds all her friends in one single conversation(we  don't know eachother). Isn't that a bit weird? Not even asking one of us  if it is okay. She seems to want things to revolve around her, I think  this is a bit strange or am I confused? And says she is nice for  inviting me to talk with them.\n\nRecently  we have been playing some games and we were supposed to play alone and I  bought a game because she convinced me we were gonna play alone and  build in a certain way. Then some guy in the chat started saying how hot  she is and making himself her slave and now she forgets about me and  without asking me invites him and start making plans with him about our  gameplay without me. Also recently I managed to get her to get her SO to  join us. Since then it went from being temporary kill gameplay instead  of building, to permanently abandoning what we were doing before and  excluding me from decisions and being mad at me for no reason when  playing. Also inviting the \"slave\" guy she met in chat, while ignoring  me.\n\nI told her about this and asked and  suddenly she blames me, twists what I am saying making me seem  illogical. Also told her about this meeting up thing again. She then why  can't I just be happy with how things are and if we reach that point  we'll reach that point. Even though she clearly stated we were gonna  meet a long time ago and reached that point. Also asked if she wants to  be friends or if I should be afraid of loosing our friendship, well that  made her real mad at me. She said I have to change and become better  and I accepted what she said because it seemed to make sense or I was  afraid of making her mad. I realize it really didn't make sense  afterwards.\n\nAlso if she jokes around  with me being stupid or something and I do it back just for fun she gets  mad. Sometimes I also used to get quiet when she excluded me and she  still uses that as an argument even though it doesn't happen anymore.\n\nIn  the beginning she said I was fun and stuff, and now she says im kind of  not(not in a direct way) but still says she want me there and likes  talking to me.\n\nOnce she said how she was  afraid meeting her would make me not want to be friend with her, and I  said something similar two times now and she says she is tired of me  needing reassurance when she herself seems to need it.\n\nI  am very confused about everything, is it me doing something wrong here  im being very nice to her overall, more than her but thats okay. When I  asked her about this stuff she said all she do is to include me all the  time and I am quiet(which is not true anymore, because she used that as  an argument b4). As if she has to include me instead of her wanting me  there to talk. She argues in circles. Gets mad for small things like not  understanding a joke or when doing something she did to me. I feel  confused, am I?\n\nLike what is happening?  She is great in many ways, but she kind of convinces she is right all  the time and gets mad when not being right or loosing. I still like her  though. However the first month she was nothing like this.. Also a lot  more considerate..", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I don't have a lot of friends right now, they kind of fall away due to change etc. I have one really good friend though, who seems to have not shown her trueself in the beginning and seemingly tries to make me feel like I am doing something wrong when she is neglecting me. Taking me for granted. So I am looking for an open and honest friend.\n\nHopefully you are person who could or would like to talk about \"deep\" stuff from time to time. Things you generally don't share with people not close to you. That is to say if we get to that point in our potential friendship. I care a lot about the people who get close to me and like them a lot. I see the best in people, or atleast try to. I always love seeing the beauty that each person has to offer in their own way.\n\nI am a person who rather have a few good friends than a lot of not so good friends. I am pretty fine having no friends if there is no good friend or just one. I feel like a close connection is important, and I don't ever forget my friends, even if they forget me or leave. I will be there if my friend needs me.\n\nBtw I am from Sweden and male(22), but I'd rather be female if I could. I like just talking, chatting, making music, programming, playing games at times too(with people), taking walks, enjoy the beauty of nature and planet earth.

I hope I'm being clear with my story below:\n\n\nMe and my two other high school friends had been very close friends and we always hung out every weekend even after graduated from high school. This never stopped even after we went to different universities. We planned to go on a trip to Asia last year (2018) as our graduation trip. We've been talking about it since the beginning of our last year in university. Fast forward to after our graduation ceremony, we made a whatsapp group specifically for us three since we're going to the trip (we have another whatsapp group but it has other people too). We talked about where exactly we were going and we all bought our air tickets. Out of no where, my friends added a new person in. I got very confused since no one has ever told me about this, but whatever, it's just one extra person, I told myself that I could put up with it. I don't mind meeting people through a party, a dinner or anything, but I am not the type of person that I would like to meet new people when I'm going on a trip.  I rather have it with just people that I know, I don't feel comfortable with living with strangers. Couple weeks later, that new person, invited another two people.. I couldn't take it. I asked my friends what was going on and they said the guy asked them (not me) privately if it was okay to invite more people to the trip and they said okay. I told them I was never informed with any thing about invitations to other people on the trip and I don't feel comfortable with it. They said it's okay. We'll just do our own things separately. In my mind, if we'll go on the trip separately, why won't they just plan their own trip instead of taking over ours? I tried to burst out my comfort zone and tell myself, \"It's not a big deal\".. The next day, I heard about them telling other people that I'm making this such a big deal. I got emotional and straight up cancelled the ticket right away. My two friends realised what I have done and apologised, but other than that, no, no one said anything to the new people. I accepted their apology but I felt incredibly disrespected from this entire thing.. So I stopped talking to them . Fast forward to another month, they told other people again, that they have already apologised, not sure why would I never let go about it.\nNow, I don't know if that's me being petty (?) or what.. I felt like they were just doing their own things and nobody told me anything about the trip.. To add on, I tried numerous times to start planning the trip after all the new people got invited but I'll get rejected by being told \"Let's do it later, we're not finalizing with the number of people\". Am I the drama queen here..? Is telling them I'm not comfortable enough with having so many people in our trip is how I should've approached this?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "ayhgg1", "created_utc": 1551991457, "title": "Ending a friendship", "author": "Orangeyellow2", "self_text": "I\u2019m a woman, 28. There\u2019s a girl same age who I\u2019ve known since I was around 18. We\u2019re both from Essex in the UK but she now lives in London. Back story is that when we first met it was because she started dating a male friend. He was also a friend of my boyfriend at the time and there was a group of us, girls and guys, some were couples - who used to go out drinking and partying pretty much every weekend, as typical 18-21 year olds would. We were always together, going to festivals, clubbing etc. This went on for a few years or so until couples started to split and people moved on (uni, moving around etc) \n\nSince then we\u2019ve all grown up a lot so don\u2019t go drinking anywhere near as much, and we are working and have partners as per the norm. But the girls of the old group have maintained a good friendship - some of us live close together but she lives in London 40 mins away. \n\nAt the time we were all quite close. She was difficult when we were younger too but not as bad as she is now. We\u2019ve been in touch and hung out over the years but not as much as when we first met. \n\nShe\u2019s very passive aggressive and unpleasant to be around. Makes snarky comments about everyone and always tries to compete with you and put you down. She\u2019s selfish as well. She\u2019s very nosy and will pry into your life with constant questions. She\u2019ll only use any information she gains to gossip and to spite you with hurtful comments. It\u2019s so tiring and negative to be around someone like that. But what\u2019s confusing is that she can have these nice moments, where she\u2019s loyal and a good listener and makes you feel at ease. Each of us will end up avoiding her for sometime and then she\u2019ll do something nice to make you feel bad, and lure you back in. (For example, I had my first baby last year and she sent a gift, even though I\u2019d not been in contact) or she\u2019ll simply reach out with a WhatsApp message and be overly nice, and I\u2019ll think I\u2019ll give her another chance. So she\u2019s nice to get you to meet up and do something with her and when you see her she\u2019s unpleasant. She\u2019s not a bad person per se. just an unbearable and rude one. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s aware how she comes across. I guess she\u2019s insecure and that\u2019s why she is like she is. Knowing that doesn\u2019t make it any easier to tolerate though. \n\nThe other girls feel the same as I do. One of them went to school with her. At school she clinged on to her and copied everything she did. To this day she\u2019s very obsessed with her and whenever we speak one on one, she\u2019s asking about her and gossiping about her. \n\nAnother of the girls fell out with her permanently a few years ago. a few insults were traded and now they don\u2019t talk at all. She tried to apologise to her but she was too stubborn and proud to accept her apology.  This makes it extra awkward in social situations and makes us not want her around even more to avoid the awkwardness. \n\nShe says things that come across really rude but in such an indirect way that she gets away with it. When my parter met her he was like what\u2019s wrong with that girl? I\u2019d warned him! \n\nWe find ourselves ignoring her calls and messages because we know she will talk endlessly about herself without even asking how you are. And that she\u2019ll try and make plans with you. \n\nSince I had the baby July last year I\u2019ve not seen her. She got offended when I didn\u2019t invite her to the baby shower (I was going to have a second one with London friends separately, as I used to live in London too and my partner is from there, which I had invited her to, but I was too heavily pregnant and cancelled it) I told her that the Essex one was only a family and few local friends which was true, but because of her old friendship connections locally and because she knew some of the friends I\u2019d invited, she felt like she should have been invited to that one. The fact is that I didn\u2019t want her there because I didn\u2019t want her to say something to ruin the day for me, embarrass me in front of family and other friends there who didn\u2019t know her, and because of the tension between her and the girl she fell out with. All while being pregnant. All I told her was that I\u2019d invited her to the other one and sorry it was cancelled. It\u2019s pretty cheeky of her to bring that up and feel entitled to be invited. Especially when we really aren\u2019t that close anymore. But that\u2019s the kind of person she is. \n\nSince I\u2019ve had the baby 7 months ago, social time is a lot more precious to me and I don\u2019t have time for her shenanigans. She\u2019s tried to come and see me a few times but I\u2019ve always made excuses. Some legitimate and others lies to avoid seeing her because I\u2019m so not bothered to see her. I saw her briefly at a friends wedding and at Christmas Eve pub drinks with other people around, but she\u2019s not met the baby or hung out one on one. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do now because this cycle of avoid - suckered in - give a little- get pissed off - avoid has gone on for too many years. \n\nThe worst thing about this all is, and the thing that makes it a problem, is that she considers us her good friends, but none of us like her or want to see her, and actively avoid her. Most people would have stopped bothering with us but she just doesn\u2019t take the hint. It is sad in a way. \n\nShe\u2019s even told me she wants me as a bridesmaid at her wedding (a bit odd as she\u2019s not even engaged) which I feel would be wrong given how I feel. She\u2019s quite frustrated in life and wants a house, marriage, kids but her boyfriend who she rents with is 8 years older and isn\u2019t too fussed about those things. She\u2019s not in a bad position as her boyfriend  earns good money while she\u2019s on a lower income, and together they do alright. Lots of her friends are now getting engaged and married and it upsets her. People feel guilty because they know she\u2019s a bit miserable but it doesn\u2019t change the fact she\u2019s rude and irritating. \n\nShe has a way of weedling herself into social events that she\u2019s not invited to and making herself available when she gets wind or suspects people are doing something (near one of our birthdays, or a regular local event for example) like she\u2019ll message and say she\u2019s around and make it super awkward to not tell her what we\u2019re doing. No one wants to be the one to tell her what we\u2019re up to because we all know that even people in the wider circle don\u2019t like her around. Sometimes when we go out and she hasn\u2019t managed to worm her way in, (it\u2019s not rude of us to not invite her even if we liked her, as she lives in London) she might know because she\u2019ll see photos on Instagram or such. And then be offended etc etc \n\nOn social media she posts constantly, trying to prove she\u2019s busy. The kind of person who has to post a selfie to show she\u2019s met up with you even if it was just a coffee. \n\nShe won\u2019t take the hint, and we\u2019re all too laid back and uncomfortable with confrontation to be the one to tell her how we feel. Because we\u2019re all so laid back and she\u2019s more emotional and tightly wound. She\u2019ll take it super badly. No one wants to hear that but she\u2019s very sensitive. It\u2019s hard because she hasn\u2019t done something to really upset anyone that would make it easier to end the \u2018friendship\u2019 \n\nI literally cringe when she messages me. I just don\u2019t want her trying so anymore. Am I bad for wanting to not have someone who bring negative energy to my life? I know it\u2019s not just me because the others feel the same. \n\nHow do you break up from a person like this? All I\u2019ve done so far is avoid meeting up with polite excuses, so many times over the years, and limit communication - for example not ignore her messages completely but keep conversations brief. On her side it must be confusing as well because no one gives it to her straight. I\u2019ve thought about saying something but I don\u2019t know how to approach the subject in a sensitive enough way to not upset the girl. Any suggestions?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

This girl is objectively one of the prettiest girls you will ever meet. I have a tough time holding on to friendships even when I don't feel this way about them so I'm sure its going to be even more tough to hold on to this one considering the fact I do. I am a senior in high school.\n\nAlright now before I go all in on this for the rest of this I am going to call her Liz. And I used to be into another girl who kind of fits into the story who I will now call Brie\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor all of sophomore and Junior year I used to be into this girl Brie. I had no reason to and she was pretty wildly out of my league, but I got really hooked on this girl and pined for her for years. Constantly felt down about it and at the end of Junior year I had a panic attack and during that attack I texted her confessing how I feel about her in a pretty gross way. Anyway this caused us to completely break communication because I knew what I said was pretty dumb and, not mean but certainly inappropriate I guess? doesn't matter. Anyway  after that I went back to school feeling much better about my self esteem, but I was still very uncomfortable around her. And me being uncomfortable around her made her uncomfortable around me which made me feel worse about the situation and it was the whole cycle of ew. So that being said I had a class with Brie and a class with Liz. My class with Liz was always after my class with Brie so I usually felt pretty down in that class and Liz would pick up on that. Now at this point me and Liz have hardly talked since Freshman year where we kinda flirted a bit, but beyond that there had been very little communication between us. Anyway Liz saw I was pretty down one day and asked what was up. I of course said nothing and she was really polite and said something along the lines of \"Well I can't make you talk about it, but if you need to I'm here.\" like wtf that was so nice.\n\nEventually I did open up to her about what was going on which was something I hadn't done to anyone despite obviously having friendships that lasted much longer. The thing that started making me feel more comfortable with her and not other people  was when I would open up to her about stuff she would open up to me about stuff in her life. Now all while this friendship is progressing I have kind of had feelings for her, but they haven't really gotten in the way and the thing that was more important to me what that we stay friends no matter how I felt about her. This week however, she opened up to me about how she is torn between two colleges despite already signing a contract with a school for a D1 sport. Later in the conversation she told me that I was the only person she had opened up to about this besides her parents which made me feel really appreciated and special in her life. Since she told me that every day we have been talking about her and what's going on in her life which was relatively normal, but it had more of a genuine feel to it now than it did before maybe? idk what it is but its a bit different.\n\nNow yesterday she told me she wanted to talk to me about a guy in the class we have together. I could feel myself getting really jealous. We didn't really get time to talk about him in the class, but the whole day after she told me that I was still feeling those pangs of jealousness and feelings of self doubt. This was also disappointing me because I really wanted to push aside these feelings, but I clearly can't help it. \n\nThis girl means the world to me and I'm not going to let her go. She is the only person I have opened up to  who has given me nothing but support, good advice, and most importantly made me feel like the relationship is not one sided. If I tell her how I feel I'm worried she will think I'm just another guy being friendly towards her because I'm trying to get in her pants. If I don't tell her though I'm sure this is going to cause me great discomfort around her and we're going to start drifting apart. I've lost so many friends and all of them have been half as nice, funny, and caring as this girl and yet still devistating. I don't want to know how it is going to feel to lose this friend. If you have had a situation similar to this or just have general advice please let me know any advice is appreciated! I'm really worried guys.\n\nThanks or the long post I'm really sorry it was this long, but this means a lot to me.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I work as a game designer and programmer, and I try to play a bit of everything so I can keep up with what works and doesn't work in games. \n\nOn the more personal side of things I'm medicated for depression and ADHD and I can be a very cynical person but I'm trying my best to change that and be a bit more positive about things. I drink socially, used to smoke a ton but after taking acid weekly for over a year, I've messed myself up too much to go back to pot, so unfortunately I won't be able to enjoy any smokes with you. I'm also a very loud, overly confident person and i talk way too much.\n\nIm also hoping that whoever I can hang out with will help me get out of my comfort zone a bit - not that I'm shy. I'm just too comfortable staying home and just doing nothing really. And I'd like to find someone I can go out and do cool stuff with. Someone who can show me all the awesome things that I know I'm missing out on.\n\nFor references, here's some of the stuff I wanna do over the next little while:\n\n- take a dancing class\n- go thrift shopping\n- geocaching\n- urban exploration (really wanna explore some old \"haunted\" places) \n- getting more into board games (good ones, not like monopoly lol) \n- try hot yoga\n- go to a spa\n- learn meditation\n- exercise to terrible old 80s workout videos\n- paintballing\n- nerf wars at BattleSports\n- check out a jazz bar\n- go to storm crow manor\n- start biking nearby lakeshore\n- take an improv class\n- volunteer at the humane society\n- learn how to fix or build things (I'm definitely not a DIY kinda person lol) \n- go to more music shows/festivals (BMTH is coming in may, I'm hyped) \n- go to one of those disco roller skate thingies\n- horror themed escape rooms (I used to work at one actually) \n- get certified for random stuff (bartender, boating, etc) \n- generally just going to the events posted weekly on /r/toronto\n\nBasically things I'd normally say \"errrr no thanks\" to. Anyways, thanks for reading. I didn't really know what else to say but looking forward to hearing from people!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

From experience I learned to just keep everyone at arms length and just keep 1-2 people actually close me. \n\nSo here's my issue: One of my two close friends this past December got a DUI while driving my car. I drove us to the bar and at the bar I gave him my keys so when we were about to leave instead of taking an Uber he drove us home. We were less that 5 miles from our destination but we didn't notice that the headlights weren't on. Cops pulled us over and he went to jail. \n\n \n\nFast forward 3 months, he is still dealing with this. He is getting his license suspended, breathalyzer in his car, has to wear an ankle bracelet to track his alcohol and drug level, and now his family lose the car insurance (they have 6 cars) adding up to almost $20,000 more yearly. I consider him a very very close friend and I keep blaming myself because I drove the car and gave him the keys and I don't know what to say to him when he talks about the situation. I don't want to be selfish and tell him how horrible I feel hearing all this when it should've been me. It was my car, I started this. How can I even make this right? I don't want to lose our friendship as it's one of the only ones I really value and if I lose this one I might as well stop trying to let people close to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is the correct way to act in this situation?

Definitely a social ambivert; I appreciate heavily my quiet time and cherish deep connections with others.

Always seeking to hear others points of view and understanding of the world!\n\nNow a little bit about me!  I\u2019m very much into music if you couldnt tell.

Up til around 20 I lived a pretty crazy life. Ups and downs, abuse, good and bad times, weird adventures. Unfortunately, during that time I also developed some pretty horrific mental issues, OCD, panic disorder, depression, all that fun stuff. I tried for a few years to work on it but when nothing worked I basically gave up, which was a big mistake.\n\nFlash forward to now. 34, living at home, most of my life experience is 15 years prior. Dad died of cancer a year ago, lost my super close long-term long-distance friend due to some ridiculously dumb decisions on my part. As a result I've had my big \"What have you been doing with your life, dummy?\" moment. So I'm basically picking myself off the mat and for the first time in years am trying to dig myself out of the hole I'm in and really live my life. Living healthier, petting more adorable dogs, trying to do all the standard young adult things I missed out on, and most importantly, learn how to tie a knot in a cherry stem with my tongue. All that feel good stuff.\n\nPart of that is making friends. I have a couple people I can talk to but part of the 1800 things I need to do to fix my life is force myself to stop being such a loner and be more social.\n\nSo what's in it for you, dear message board reader? Well, I can be occasionally funny. I can give you tips on the proper way to cook pasta. If you're going through some mental health issues or dysfunctional family issues, chances are I've seen it in some form and can offer advice or at least lend an ear. I've probably made more horrible mistakes than whatever you've done and am climbing my way up from a rock bottom, so I'm probably not going to be very judgy. I basically have a brain built for Jeopardy, which means I know a little bit about a lot of things, so you ain't going to stump me with your interests unless it's South American geography, in which case I'm screwed and you should close this window immediately.\n\nCongratulations on making it to the end of this message!

{"post_id": "ayr35e", "created_utc": 1552056569, "title": "Boring/ Annoying SJW Friend", "author": "cantfeelmyhandd", "self_text": "So I\u2019ve been friends with this girl for the past year. When we met I really loved her as a friend. She is incredibly empathetic, very sweet, and incredibly interested in things like mental and physical health, which I find to be super productive and amazing to have in a friend. It really is great to have a friend who isn\u2019t focused on going out all the time, and really does make me want to be a better person. However, I\u2019ve found that I\u2019m not completely satisfied with her as someone who is just nice and supportive. The issue is that I find her to be (and I hate to say this) incredibly just boring sometimes. Our senses of humor don\u2019t always align, and she is super quick to get \u201ctriggered\u201d or offended by things that people say which i find to be important and funny. Sometimes it feels like social justice is her entire personality, and i\u2019m just not compelled by it. She\u2019s also friends with my three roommates- all of whom are guys- (I\u2019m a girl, 19)- and they feel pretty similarly about her. It\u2019s almost like she feels that she\u2019s morally superior to everyone, and even if it doesn\u2019t come out all the time, it still shows itself occasionally. She often just seems super socially and realistically out of touch. She\u2019ll do things like come over, and asked my roommate if they want to do yoga. When he says no she\u2019ll get all sad and kind of offended, until he feels guilty and decides to do yoga with her. How lame. My roommate also went on a trip to China, and before he went she wanted to sit him down and force him to listen to a powerpoint presentation she had made on the history of China\u2019s violence towards Tibet. (She\u2019s Tibetan.) She made him listen to this while we were all hanging out and drinking. He left halfway, but she still subjected my friend and I, who had nothing to do with this, to the rest. Super condescending and out of touch if u ask me. She often just seems super socially and realistically out of touch. Or my  friend- who works three days a week at a pool. She said to her the other day- \u201cOh Chris, I feel so bad- you have to work so much, you must be so exhausted!\u201d And Chris responded to her that no, three days a week is not a lot to be working and basically that she needs to get a grip on reality. My roommates and I live Relatively close to the school that we all attend, while she lives about a 50 minute commute away. Therefore, she is often asking to spend the night-which usually entails sleeping in my bed, even though she had sex with my roommate and could easily sleep with him, or more realistically, just on the couch!  She even asked if she could get a key to the apartment. I want my space and don\u2019t want to have her sleep over, honestly ever. honestly, I just find her and her friends to be quite boring, and often quite annoying and out of touch and not at all funny. she hasn\u2019t done anything particularly bad to wrong me, or to warrant me just ending the friendship. so here I am, she\u2019s been hitting me up for the past two weeks and I\u2019ve been flaking on her. Now we\u2019re supposed to hang out today, but only because I feel super guilty and now I have potential plans which I would be more interested in with someone else. She hasn\u2019t really done anything crazy wrong but honestly I\u2019m just not wanting to spend time with her anymore. What should I do to end this in a way that doesn\u2019t hurt anyone too much? Keep in mind that we\u2019ve been incredibly close for the past year, and that her family has done a lot for me.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I know it doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal at all, but hear me out. He wasn\u2019t hitting on me or anything, he just said it in a just flat way. He knew that I recently cut ties with an ex of mine (three weeks ago) and that whole thing was (and still is) emotionally affecting me a whole bunch. I NEVER brought up my old relationship that much, so it seemed kind of random with him mentioning me finding someone else. \n\nNevertheless, I\u2019m extremely heartbroken from my old relationship, and it\u2019s been so difficult for me to move on. \n\nI thought it was so insensitive to say that to someone. To put it into perspective: If my friend were to be crushed from a relationship and just RECENTLY managed to separate herself from it and is still hurting and trying to heal, why would I (or anyone) think it\u2019s a good idea or remotely helpful to tell her to jump into another relationship?? And tell her she\u2019s lonely and to find a boyfriend??\n\nSorry for ranting. I\u2019m just upset I lost a friend I liked hanging out with. And on top of my heartbreak, now I feel even more like shit after what he said. \n\nIt\u2019ll be great if I can make some new friends on here. I\u2019ll do my best to interact with others, and I hope to make others laugh! I\u2019m a senior in high school, and I want to major in business or economics. I also like creative writing and anime. Let\u2019s see if we click! \n\nUPDATE since people are assuming some stuff: I wasn\u2019t using him as my therapist. We were typical friends and both occasionally expressed our issues to each other. We had no problems beforehand. And when I told him I didn\u2019t really want to talk to him anymore after his comment, he said, \u201cOkie dokie.\u201d Really doesn\u2019t seem sorry to me.

Im in a serious relationship of 1.5 years &amp; he is the love of my life!\n\nMy freshman year of high school, I met a guy(Tyler) and we started hanging out. First it was more as friends, we would hang in groups, but this eventually led to both of us telling each other we have strong feelings. Although we never said \"bf/gf\" or actually went out on dinner dates... We talked on the phone every single night, always expressed our feelings, and hung out quite often (mostly on double dates). The reason it was not able to get beyond that was because I had VERY strict parents and no car.. so we had to make do with what we could. The feelings were very clear between us though and everyone knew it. This went on for 2 years till my junior year of HS. One day he randomly told me that he is moving to California in 1 month. His brothers went to college there &amp; he wanted to, too. So, he was leaving early to get residency from his senior year of HS for college. I was devastated bcuz of the moved because he didn't tell me sooner. He insisted he wanted to, but he didn't want to hurt me and wanted to wait till he was sure hes leaving... Blah blah blah. \n\nI cried for days and confided a lot in my best friends at the time.He moved and we lost touch bcuz of how it ended. 6 months later, he reached out to me again and apologized. He said that he wanted to be on good terms and that he misses me. We decided long distance is too hard to pursue, but we can move past the previous incident. We would talk everyday and he came to visit. We felt like it made sense to include friends rather than going the 2 of us so i invited 3 and he invited 3. Each was intentionally paired up. My best friend(Lily) was invited &amp; paired up with 1 of his guy friends. She wasn't into him. I noticed she would talk a lot with Tyler, but didn't think much of it at the time. Afterwords, Tyler &amp; I kept in touch for a bit till I saw he went to prom with another girl. I was moving on, but still upset and confided in Lily again. I decided I should cut him out of my life till I full move on. Highschool ended and we all lost touch, but stayed connected through social media. We all dated different people throughout college. A few months ago I actually saw Tyler randomly at a party in my city. I barely talked to him because 4 years had passed and it was a bit awkward. He was newly single, but me being taken- I didn't think much conversation was necessary. \n\nLily and I are not as close as we were in highschool (like SISTERS), but we are still close. We still say \"love you &amp; miss you\" when we text &amp; keep in touch very regularly. We last spoke 5 days ago.\n\nYesterday, I check snapchat and I see Lily is in California. I didn't think anything of it. I continue watching and see she is there with TYLER! Literally going out all around town with him. I gave her the benefit of the doubt that maybe she was there visiting family and they were just hanging out for a day of her trip as friends. I sent her a message and said, \"girllll why dont you tell me anything?\" Implying that this would obviously be something she would tell me. That is how our friendship always was. If she saw this guy who was a big part of my past &amp; hung out with him....shed tell me. She opened it and never replied. Today I see her posting with him all day going out on dates and just barely covering his face. As if that makes it better. It is not as friends. She is staying with him. It is clear she only went there to see him. She is most likely staying with him. I am literally baffled. Yes, I have a boyfriend now who is amazing, but the point is just loyalty. If she had texted me and told me about this I would have felt different. But doing this behind my back is dirty. God knows how long this has actually been going on and she has been texting me \"i love you\" like nothing is happening. He was still my first crush, my first kiss. I introduced them. Does she not owe it to me for him to be off-limits? Are there really not enough guys in the world that you have to purse someone who was so huge to one of your closest childhood friends.... Who lives in another state. How can you actually be ok with psychically flying out to see him and staying with him. Posting it all on social media, but not caring to give me any heads up.  Not only that but when I call her out- not care? SO GRIMY!\n\nAm I wrong here? Do I have the right to feel how I feel? I currently feel like I am 100% done with her after this.

Unfortunately , a lot of people i click with initially ended up not working out and people who i bonded well for the first two months ended up betraying me for having different opinions and cannot agree to disagree. But i am not giving up trying.\n\n**About me**\n\nI'm a 25 m from Singapore who have struggled growing up with autism and was a shut in before till i decided to change 3 years ago. I used to indulge myself in games and anime all day and wanted to escape reality, but i realized i was miserable and decided to change. Thanks to the support from some people i met in my life , i managed to change to who i am today.\n\nAlthough i still have friends who i still keep in contact , i have fallen in touch with them because most of my friends are very into games and anime. But i have moved on to other things and i have bigger goals such as being a web developer for a startup company as well as joining a programming boot camp for the learning experience.\n\nMost of my life has been at home , but i want to change that and be able to do more and try more different things , being able to travel , meet different people and living alone independently has been the ideal dream of mine and i hope that one day i will be able achieve it.\n\n**What i am looking for**\n\nI am looking for anyone who wants a genuine platonic friendship long term. I am open to talk about anything so long its not related to politics. I like heart to heart talks and being able to open up to someone as that is key in finding close platonic relationships, in exchange i will listen to you too. Admittedly, I'm not the best at conversing , but i will definitely try my best if you give me a chance.\n\nI still do watch anime and play games , but i am just not as invested into it as before. So feel free to talk about anime and games but please do not make it the main conversation throughout the whole chat.I **prefer to talk on discord ,** so pm me your discord id if you have discord.\n\nHope to meet people here :)\n\n**Other things i like to talk about**\n\nprogramming , Food , interesting places to travel\n\n**Side note**\n\n\\*\\*I still struggle with autism and every now and then i have weird messages asking how i overcome it. I want to emphasize that **mental health issues sticks with a person for a lifetime.** There is no cure for it, but its how you accept or help someone in need and it takes **a lot of courage for someone to acknowledge it.**\n\n**I am fortunate to have a lot of support** and **having the will to keep trying no matter how many times i fail** to learn how to improve in situations like communication , but **its different for everyone**\\*", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

It really hurts to realize that I don\u2019t even have one single friend who\u2019s willing to check up on me, no matter how busy they are.

Hi, my name is Fredrik, 23/m/Sweden. This is my post for someone to talk to.\n\nI'm sitting here in my spectacularly messy room, with a mirror that's been in the box for two weeks, a yoga mat that has never been used, and a couch full of laundry, thinking \"if only there was something to do\". Please, help me continue neglecting my responsibilities, there's nothing worse than chores after all.\n\nI have a few hobbies:\n\nI like reading a lot, but ever since I started uni I feel like all my reading stamina gets chewed up by the massive books I have to buy for each class. Damn you Pearson, you don't need to make them all the size of houses! Thankfully, I've managed to beat my brain (and deadlines) into submission enough recently to finish Deadhouse Landing by Ian Cameron Esslemont, which is number 1000000 or something in a massive fantasy series. Usually I prefer some scifi, some fantasy, or some \"classics\" (if that's a genre). Recently I also dipped my toes a bit into popular history/geography books with Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond, which I found very interesting (even if I did not completely agree). Relating to this subject a bit, love talking about worldbuilding /and-or history in most shapes! Tell me all about your RPG campaign if you have one of those going on. \n\nI'm also pretty big into gaming. I mean, the last few years it seems like I'm moving more towards just listening to other peoples experiences of games, and discussing that, but I still play every once and a while. Usually strategy, or single player rpg(s) on the pc, since I'm to poor / cheap / lazy to get any console system. Currently playing a lot of Crusader Kings 2 for some of that lovely (a) historical strategy gameplay, although I've also enjoyed some Kenshi and Kingdom Come in the last few months. \n\nLike everyone else I love me some movies and series. I watch mostly comedies / fantasy / scifi (who could guess), also a fair amount of anime if you're up for that sort of thing. Podcasts or rather audiodramas are also right up my alley if you listen to those. I\n\nRight now I'm spending my time agonizing a bit over my future (except for being terribly bored), what I want to do after I'm done at uni. I've got a bit of an maths-programming-engineering master going on, but I'd hate to start working on something and just figure out I hate it after after a few years, you know? I'd love to do something creative one day, maybe go into games development or something the like if nothing else. The experimenting I've done in the subject in uni (and private) has certainly been fun enough. I have a big interest in history, and enjoy some good philosophizing, but I think I'm too much of a coward to pursue any of those longer than as a hobby.\n\nIf you've made it this far, and I seem interesting, we could continue talking over Skype, Steam, Viber, Telegram, Discord, carrier pigeon, smoke signals,  or whatever form of communication you have going on.\n\nI'm probably not brave enough to get voice-talking talking for a while, and I might not reply instantly, but hey, gotta take risks. If, on the other hand, you want some anti-convincing, here's some more negative sides to me.\n\nI can be a bit of an elitist sometimes, a bit lazy and overly competitive. I can argue about anything you'd like, so if you're a bit of a semi cynical arse like me, I'm up for a challenge. Feel free to tell me if I'm being a dick though, I try to avoid it if I can.\n\nI've also had my fair amount of darker moments, so if you're anything a lot of the depressed folks hanging around here, I can scrounge up a conversation about that too.\n\nI wouldn't say I am confident on my goals in life quite yet. There's this lovely song that translates to \"We will never die\" about making such an important or popular contribution to the world, that you never quite die. That's something I want, if actual immortality isn't possible. For more attainable goals; I want to live with my long distance partner, finish my education and be happy. Especially be happy.\n\n// Fredrik\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Or that food you simply can't resist. Or maybe just tell them about how you ended up being a lazy-a** while watching Netflix and didn't go out at all.  \n\n***be clear about what you're looking for, but try not to sound too desperate***  \n\nWe all go through problems in our life, right? While there's nothing bad about opening up about your problems, it's definitely more inviting to write about what you're looking for instead/things you like to do.  \n\nNow here's to why I'd suggest this strategy. Imagine you end up writing a post that mostly consists of you ranting about your problems and by chance you even find a few people to talk to. Chances are that they'll soon get bored of you because a lot of us are looking for the excitement of having another person to talk life with.  \n\nAnd therefore when you write an inviting post that only sounds exciting, it'll naturally increase the chances of getting a response back from other people. And soon as you get to know that person well, and you start getting along well, go ahead and rant all that you want. You've made yourself a friend who really likes spending time with you. And they'd love to listen to you and provide you with the best advice they can to better the situation. Most importantly, they're going to stick to you now no matter what.\n\n***last but definitely not least, accept the fact that you are going to get ghosted at some point in your life, and that's totally okay***\n\nIt can be someone you talked to on reddit, it can sometimes be your best friend or maybe a family member. Sometimes people suddenly stop talking to you. Without even providing you a reason. Yep it's unfair but that's life, my friend. Instead of spending your entire day wondering if you did something wrong, the best thing you can do is cut them off out of your life. Stop sending any further texts right now. Life is full of people. And believe me when I say that, there are 90% chances that there are going to be people who would love talking to you.\n\nI hope this helps someone who's having a hard time finding someone to talk to. If you're one of those people, I would absolutely love to hear from you. I'm usually prompt at responding back so that's a plus.\n\nHave a wonderful Sunday!\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for my first ever reddit gold!!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Thank you for clicking on my post. I've been struggling a lot with life and I feel very lonely, so I thought I'd try this subreddit again. I found my best friend in here, and I know all of you can find significant people too. I'd love to have emotional support from someone and also give it in return. I'm looking for friends around my age (+2/-2) hopefully in the US or Canada due to timezone and ping reasons. I'm very selective with people since my time is limited, and I want a long-term intimate friendship, not a superficial trade of hi's and bye's like most people do. If you don't put effort in a friendship, don't expect me to do the same. I've met many people who are indifferent, and it sucks. I love people who are passionate about things like me, who are open minded and creative, and who like to discuss deep topics. It's even better if you share some of my interests, as that makes bonding easier. Now that I've specified what I'm looking for, I'll introduce myself!\n\n**Interests**\n\n* Vidyagames - I've played games my whole life, and I know every single one of them. RPGs, MMOs, Bullet Hells, FPS, Puzzle, Strategy, Platformers, Roguelikes, Metroidvanias, MOBAs, Sandboxes, Rhythm, Emulators; I've played every single genre. If you play something, chances are I have played it too. If you know what Touhou is, you'll be automatically cool.\n* Music - I have a *very* broad taste in music, and one of my dreams is to be a music composer one day. Classical, Jazz, Rock, Metal, and Videogame/Anime soundtracks are my favorite genres. If I were to talk about my favorite musicians this post would never end, but I'll mention the ones I listen to the most to give you an idea: Yoshihisa Hirano, Toby Fox, literally any classical composer, Danny Baranowsky, ZUN, and Yuki Kajiura. Music is my biggest passion, and I'd love to share my songs with someone. I also own a Violin and a Harmonica, although my favorite instrument is the Piano and I dream of playing it again (I'm too poor to afford one).\n* Anime - I don't watch anime as much as I used to given that Crunchyroll has such a small selection and other sites are illegal and risky, but I've watched a lot of anime in my life. My favorites are Death Note, Hunter x Hunter, Madoka Magica, Code Geass, Cowboy Bebop, Serial Experiments Lain, Steins;Gate, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Akame ga Kill, Monster and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni.\n* Literature - I've always been an avid reader, although lately I haven't read much due to stress. My favorite authors so far are H. P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe, William Shakespeare, George Orwell, and Ray Bradbury. \n* Computer Science - I got accepted into college for this major, so expect me to be devoted to it in the future. Right now since I have lots of free time I'm studying Java early to be ready for my first course, as my college is very competitive. I'd love to find someone who also plans to major in this or at least has interest in it, as it's quite hard and boring to study alone.\n* Philosophy - I tend to meditate a lot upon deep subjects that not many people care to think about. While I don't have time to seriously study it and my current knowledge is vague, I'm aware of the different schools of philosophy and the prominent philosophers. Like Socrates said, I know that I know nothing. I'm very open minded and love intellectual discussions with solid arguments.\n* Horror - It calms me, I don't know why. ~~I'm not a psychopath I promise.~~\n* Memes - They aren't as good as they used to be before the Fortnite/TikTok nation attacked, but I used to be a dedicated memer back in the days. If you know 4chan, Twitch, old YouTube, or NicoNico memes, you've gained my respect.\n* Food - I love all kinds of food and I'd love to be a chef one day.\n\n**Things about me**\n\n* I'm very pale, I weigh 114 pounds (being slim is great), I have green eyes and dark brown hair, and I'm assaulted by the obscure evil curse called acne.\n* I'm an INTP and Cancer.\n* My favorite weather is rain/snow and my favorite season is winter.\n* I might be an alien, shh.\n* I love cooking and my friends say my recipes look delicious.\n* I love all animals --they are much more pure and innocent than hoomans-- but mostly cats and spiders!\n* I was homeschooled by myself through high school, and I'm currently waiting to attend college in the fall.\n* I'm a Hikikomori.\n* I self-taught English as it's not my native language. \n* I have a 3.85 GPA and 29 ACT composite score, it's not the best but despite that I think I'm intelligent.\n* I love Dr Pepper.\n* I was bullied all my life, and I suffer from severe depression and social anxiety, so please bear with me.\n\nMy preferred platform is Discord, as I don't use anything else, so please be ready to talk there. And now, to close this post and make sure you read it, I'll ask a fun question! *If you were granted a single wish, what would you wish for? (Wishing for more wishes will not work here XD)*\n\nThank you a lot for reading this, have a nice day/night!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We now are both in our last years of university. We both grew up quite sheltered ( private school, strict parents ect ). She chose to do community college in our small city while i moved away to a very large city and moved out of state. I found we have had massively different university experiences. I was forced to make friends, live on my own, go to residence meet different people and so on. While she complained about how she made no friends and basically failed first year and still continues the same patters. I feel like friendship wise im not sure what to do. I love her dearly but ive come to the realization that we arent really good friends anymore even though we keep in touch frequently. She has a personality that if something is wrong to just ignore it and barely scrape by and do nothing. Ive found over the years shes been very critical of my choices involving friends maybe due to jealousy? She has made fun of me religiously for joining an sorority, getting involved in my programs clubs ect and im not really sure how to handle it. She also has a very shitty and horrible partner but ignores it so they can still be on good terms and when i express my minor relationship problems she gripes and tells me how horrible my boyfriend is ect when if i do the same thing she once cut me off for days. We are a long distance friendship and im not sure if its jealousy or just different lifestyles but ive been finding her very immature in any adult conversation and her attitude i find frankly annoying. I dont know if i should bring this up because i feel like if i do she would back paddle and say she never does that. I just find it so draining to have someone always be so critical of my friends, boyfriends , life choices ect when she doesnt have any expereince in them.

A couple of minutes passed with me seeing him typing - until he finally said not since he was three. I could tell this was a sore topic for him, as it took him a while to answer. I told him it was needed for college, but he told me that his mom had filled out government paperwork allowing him not to be vaccinated for life. I ask him if it was his mom or just him - he responded that he had done his research and that he was personally against it. \n\nI am strongly pro-vaccination.

You don\u2019t have to like the same exact stuff I like, which I\u2019ll get to in a minute. But before that I need to admit something. Because of my upbringing and things that happened in my childhood, I have a very hard time making male friends. It\u2019s hard for me to trust, confide, and feel comfortable with the vast majority of guys. It doesn\u2019t affect my daily life (I still treat people normally at work and such), but because of my hobby interests and living in a semi-rural area, it\u2019s hard to make good friends I feel comfortable with. I have a really hard time getting too close to the guys who share my interests, at least in my area.\n\nSo anyways, what are my hobbies? Well who doesn\u2019t like video games these days? More specifically I\u2019m VERY fond of strategy games whether it be turn based or real time or 4Ktype stuff (think Civ). Lately I\u2019ve been super obsessed with Total War:Warhammer 2\n\nI like RPGs too but generally things that are dark fantasy or cyberpunk themed. I\u2019m a major cyberpunk lover in particular, and I like dark fantasy that features a little bit of eldritch horror.\n\nBut my biggest hobby by far is war gaming and painting miniatures. In particular I\u2019m a huge lore nerd when it comes to Warhammer Fantasy and Warhammer 40k. I love the modeling and painting as well, and if you could see my living space it\u2019s littered with random models and plastic on shelves or in boxes. I\u2019m spending more time getting into modeling and sculpting as of late too. I\u2019ve been inspired to teach myself stuff like casting and sculpting out of the intense desire to make my miniatures look even cooler.\n\nI get along with people who are very passionate about the things they like because I love to hear them talk about it. Nothing is better than learning about something interesting from someone who really really loves it, and my interests are pretty broad so I\u2019m excited to discover and learn new things. \n\nI also get along with people who are empathetic. I\u2019m pretty left leaning, but what matters more to me is that you care about treating people right. So anyways, I just want to clarify that I\u2019m not trying to exclude male friends; it\u2019s just that I would probably open up a bit easier to someone who isn\u2019t a man. But I\u2019d love to be friends with anyone who is a decent person and has similar interests. So if you think we\u2019d get along, feel free to let me know. I haven\u2019t done this sort of thing before so I don\u2019t know how to end this post.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I also have interests in writing, programming, radio, ice skating, binging on youtube, and trying new foods.\n\nI am a very broken person and horribly inconsistent.  I can be happy one minute and then 20 minutes later I can be the most miserable person in the world.\n\nI prefer female friends, but again I'm not looking for a relationship.

{"post_id": "azui6e", "created_utc": 1552316837, "title": "Friends?", "author": "StrawberryChainsaw", "self_text": "Hello!\n\nI'm looking for friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really need someone understanding, and kind.  Definitely not without a sense of humor either.\n\nLike really understanding.  Maybe even wise.  Like, maybe someone who can guide me through life b/c I'm 25 and I feel like I don't know anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kinda wear my heart on my sleeve.  My voice is between super loud and super quiet depending on my mood/situation.  I have a hard time finding a tone balance.  It's super funny.  I'm goofy by choice and I make the weirdest/funniest voices.\n\nI'd like someone who shares these beliefs with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA) Just because I'm crying doesn't mean I'm weak.  Just because I'm angry doesn't mean I'm crazy.  Just because I'm nice doesn't mean I'm a pushover, and you and I are entitled to how we feel.  No matter what.  That is the be all and end all, and we're freaking going places! (Like in life but it can also be to the movies or whatever.)  \n\nB) Respect is a basic need. Just common courtesy.  Like I can't take a person who calls me awful things and says sorry 20 times over and never changes.  That's not how love works I don't think.  Trust me I forgive many a times to the moon and back, all I'm saying is that even I have limits.\n\nC)I'm not changing, and neither are you.  We're in this together and if you can't take me first hand for the goofy, nice, generous, and flawed person I am, then move along please.  We are not meant to be a part of the same tribe.  If I like you, and you like me as a friend then that's when we can grow together.  I'm not sure that's just how it works for me.  I have to like your vibes to get to like you.  It's a gut instinct.  Stomachs of the same feather flock together I suppose.\n\nD) Screwing up is okay.  On your way to the top making mistakes is okay.  (Except with the insults for me)Like if we decide to make a seven layer cake and it gets all burnt because we were like playing mario kart in the other room for 2 hours then that's okay.  If we get into a bar fight and we're both ashamed of ourselves for going that far that's okay.  If we get kicked out of mattress barn for trying the new sleep cloud 2000 by taking a nap that's okay.  If we eat a whole XL pizza by ourselves--with 3 different wing flavors AND garlic knots to boot because we're upset and to the point of breaking down and losing our minds because no one is perfect and that's okay.  We're imperfect human beings together.\n\nE) Talking to yourself is totally fine.  Making faces in the mirror too.  I do not assume insanity if you feel so alone/bored you have to talk to your double in the mirror or summon bloody mary in the bathroom.  I'm bringing candles and I'm joining. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF) Courage is key.  Say what you wanna say.  If I have blind spots then be my seeing eye dog.  Just tell me in a way with urgency and do it out of love.  Love and only love as a friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nG) Communication is critical.  I'm thick skulled.  I cannot read your mind.  Yes I do need you to spell out what you are thinking, and not assume that I know.  I do not.  Ever.  In the history of the world will I ever know what you are thinking unless I ask or you tell me (And I do ask).  Like as specific as you possibly can.  Yes, to the point of it sounding like an instruction manual, or an open story with every word spelled out.  Do not condescend me or make me feel less than like a child.  Talking is only the bridge to understanding and empathy.  I can't do either of those unless I'm given certain information via text, phone call, email, or on the couch with warm hot cocoa.  And for the love of god, please do not guilt me with the I \"should/could/would know\".  That doesn't help me in the moment, and it never will.  Yes it is the only way.  There is never a time limit on our conversation, so as long as it takes tell me what you are thinking, and I will promise to listen with an open heart.\n\nH) I'm long distance but that doesn't mean I'm not real.  If I say I'm trying to come visit I mean it.  If it takes a year, or two then so be it, but I genuinely want to be connected to people who want to have fun and laugh with me.  \n\nI) Encouragement is for everyone.  I don't believe there's enough \"lifting people up\" nowadays.  Sometimes I feel the notion that people think encouragement is just for children.  Of course there are different ways to be encouraging.  All I'm say is if I have a bad business idea tell me why you think it's bad, but keep pushing forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway with that being said.  My interests involve pusheen, tarot cards and horoscopes.  My likes include baking, video games, and sleep.  My loves include animals, eating, and again--sleeping.  Also romance.  Yes I'm the romantic and idealistic friend, don't judge me. &lt;3\n\nHere are some of my flaws listed below so you know what you're getting.\n\nI'm very indecisive.  It takes me forever to make a life choice or even a smoothie flavor.  I put both on the same level of difficulty. LOL\n\nYes I'm lazy.  I can sleep for 14 hours a day.  I do not regret a second.\n\nI'm over indulgent.  I talk about food all the time.  But I'm a wizz at knowing where to eat!\n\nI'm insecure.  I like long sleeves and jeans.  But ironicaly I don't care about mis-matching patterns.  I love beautiful patterns. (i.e. vera bradley)\n\nWhat I ACTUALLY want for Christmas is either something far too expensive or something you can't fix.  So just get me a hug. :)\n\nI get distracted easily.  Like really easy.  I always say \"Aww this is cute\" like a million times in a store.\n\nI get bored easily.  I feel caged a lot.  It's a complex with me.  I love feeling free.\n\nI get angry.  I do blow up.  But it only happens like once or twice a year if ever.  It's a really great year if I don't blow up.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah pm me peeps I'm great to talk to.

Warning rant(s) incoming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really, really, tired of pretending to be happy. People really don't want to know the real me. The real me is a bitter gloomy loner. To be honest I don't trust anyone enough to tell them what I'm really thinking - ever. It is so hard to not be me when I talk to people. I KNOW people don't want to hear about how my day is really doing and they don't want to hear about my problems - because what kind of conversation is that for prospective/pending friends? I don't even really want to talk about those things but my life is melancholy and mundane.\n\nI really, really, doesn't like carrying conversations but at the same time desperately want someone in this world to give a damn. So you know what? I try really hard to make conversations go, but at the end of the day it boils down to whether or not I send another message. I ghost people. Sue me. Why is it always up to me?  If the other person was actually interested they would follow up yes? Especially once we've crossed platforms. I put out AT LEAST a paragraph response, with at least one question so they have something to work off of. What do they give me? a one sentence answer to my question, that's it. Am I supposed to just keep bombarding people with questions until I run out? because it happens. It's gotten to the point I feel I can tell from the first response whether or not they are actually interested / capable of having a conversation. Even when I think it is going okay they eventually stop replying.  \n\nAlso sharing interests is trivial and frivolous. Does it really matter if I play video games, or watch anime, or draw stupid shit? In my experience people just say \"oh cool me too\" or \"what are your favorites/ I like X Y and Z\" and move on. I'm sorry I don't have Netflix and I live under a rock and know nothing about popular music. \n\nI'm frankly done trying. I'll sleep, wake up, not be disappointed because it will be exactly as I thought to be, and that'll be the end of it. Even if by some miracle people want to reply I don't know if I can do it anymore. \n\nOBVIOUSLY I could have made this a legit \"friend ad\" but why? I'm sick of trying to sell something that just isn't real. That is not me. This is me. I may sound like I'm full of myself, but I actually do give a shit about other people and do want to meet people- I'm just fucking bad at life and want to disappoint you sooner rather than later. I'm glad this works for some people, but I'm just not good enough or cut out for this. Sorry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR If you know the real me you probably won't like me and you certainly won't think I'm interesting.  \n\n ", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

For many different reasons my friends come and go, and I\u2019ve never felt truly close with someone non-romantically.\n\nI like to think of myself as an approachable person who maybe spends too much time on Netflix and is convinced that yoga is a form of exercise. I\u2019ve been on a couple of fad diets and am now forced to pretend that I did them for a laugh rather than addressing my potential issue with body dysmorphia. Like most Brits I\u2019m inclined to be non-confrontational and have apologised to doors and, most recently, a thick, bright red pillar I walked into whilst distracted by another man\u2019s chiseled visage. I think my boyfriend only laughs at my jokes so I would continue to laugh at his; I\u2019m convinced we\u2019re the only people who find each other funny. I\u2019ve bought six books since the start of the year but haven\u2019t finished any of them.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019ve suddenly burst into a series of pointless confessions, so am I. I suppose I\u2019m trying to portray myself in a way that maybe a potential friend could relate to, and if you do, do send me a line. I\u2019m done being a loner. As an idealist I believe most people are good, and all it takes is for good people to have the same objective to create a strong connection.\n\nRight, enough patter.

A few months go by and I start to flirt with one of the girls that was at the bonfire and end up trying to date her. She made it obvious that we would be best as friends but I didn\u2019t listen and continued to bug her.

{"post_id": "azydmr", "created_utc": 1552336380, "title": "Should I let them go? (First Post)", "author": "alefeelsmoody", "self_text": "Hi y\u2019all. I\u2019m in a state where I don\u2019t want to talk to someone I considered a ride or die for about a year now and am not sure what to do about it.\n\nFor context on why we aren\u2019t speaking:\nWe\u2019re college girls, so we met when we were freshman in the dorms in Fall 2017. We got very close to each other very quickly. I started to call her my wife and for a short time had some kind of feelings for her that I chose to never act on. We\u2019ll call her Dell. Dell was very physically affectionate towards me (cuddles and kisses were a norm) and confided in me a lot of personal things about herself. \n\nOver the summer break when we both had to go back home, I\u2019d kind-of begun to see her differently.\n\nShe has some mental disorders that make her difficult to talk to at times because of her triggers being social in nature; (any sort of \u201cwe need to talk\u201d just gives her a panic attack). So any problems that I could have with her were often pushed out of the way for her sake, often without her knowing they were problems. However, I also started to see her as less of a good person as a whole. She has a tendency to need to  \u201calways be right.\u201d She always has to have her way because she somehow always needs to have control. She\u2019s constantly deflecting any sort of serious conversation to other issues because she basically refuses to answer to herself, and most recently she can\u2019t change her routine for someone else\u2019s sake.\n\nShe\u2019d gotten into a short lived relationship back last Fall (September 2018). I knew that we were both super affectionate, but I still made an effort to reach out to her then boyfriend to talk to him and let me know if he ever wanted me to not be like that. I only recently learned that he\u2019d been uncomfortable with her being affectionate, but rather than respect his wishes she basically disregarded them and acted \u201cnormally\u201d behind his back. I don\u2019t blame him now for dumping her back in November. (His friends also didn\u2019t like her, which is understandable as a reason, but I\u2019m starting to think there\u2019s more.) After he dumped her, Dell also decided it was a grand idea to hook up with two people I\u2019d *hooked up with before, knowing that it makes me uncomfortable. She said she\u2019d \u201cforgotten\u201d me telling her about that boundary, but also lied to me about hooking up with them both again a second time. (Flag 1)\n\nI\u2019ve been dating my boyfriend- we\u2019ll call him Jason- for about 6 months now. Back in December Jason asked me to kindly stop referring to Dell as \u201cmy wife\u201d on social media, *and asked me to not be so \u201caffectionate\u201d with her out of fear that he thought we wouldn\u2019t be perceived as serious. (Making out with her while drunk was a bit of a norm that, looking back, is a red flag.) At first I was terrified of the request since I was worried things would be different between us, but in hindsight it was largely because I\u2019d had some feelings for her still there. I didn\u2019t want to stake my relationship on something trivial so I talked to Dell. And she got upset.\n\nAfter winter break, I\u2019d put a lot of time into being with Jason, and Dell felt that id left her in the dust because I didn\u2019t miss her as much as I missed him. Which I hate to admit was true, but I also just didn\u2019t feel that I missed her at all during the winter break as I did over the summer or winter before then (freshman year.)\n\nDell also expressed to me that she would\u2019ve rather I follow her example and just act \u201cnormally\u201d behind Jason\u2019s back, which really didn\u2019t sit well with me. (Flag 2)\n\nNow, like any good person, I\u2019ve tried to bring my friend circles together with my boyfriend. He and I don\u2019t have many common interests, so interactions with my friends would be limited as a result. Dell constantly acted more bitter at the mention of Jason than I\u2019d like. So I recently confronted her about it. Turns out she\u2019s still bitter about Jason asking me to stop calling her \u201cwife\u201d and resents him. She\u2019s biter because I haven\u2019t hung out with her \u2014 which was purposeful because I don\u2019t feel comfortable around her with the suspicion that she hates the man I\u2019m dating \u2014 and APPARENTLY is bitter about me going to vacation for spring break with Jason despite any \u201cprospective\u201d plans she and I had made. We\u2019d has chats about doing something together but nothing ever really came from it. (Flag 3).\n\nTLDR; There\u2019s a lot of other things about her that I\u2019ve started to dislike, but these flags have largely been that she\u2019s:\n1) Okay with lying to ME and others to get her way\n2) Encourages me to lie to my S/O for HER sake\n3) Is upset that I\u2019m not making her a priority in my life as I used to\n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to Dell in days. Jason and my other friends have encouraged that I take a high road and talk to her myself in person, but I don\u2019t want to see her. I seek advice.\n\nAny help?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

It doesn\u2019t mean that I can\u2019t be a good friend. I am extremely loyal (I will annoy the ever-loving crap outta you once I get to know you, in a loving kind of way). Anyways please forgive me if I do anything crazy due to my anxiety. I would like some friends. Maybe some people to play video games with or just chat, or bonus for hanging out if we live within a close vicinity to each other. Right now I\u2019m not down for talking much because 1) I lost my mic because I am a scatter brained (which you could probably already tell) and 2) I live in an apartment complex and part of my anxiety is that my mind is like YOU CAN NEVER DISTURB ANYONE EVER OR THEY WILL ALL HATE YOU AND YOU WILL MELT IN A POOL OF DESPAIR AND TUNA! Anyways with that cleared up, I enjoy video games: Team shooters (I usually like support or quick aggressive roles) co-op games (I think I like them. I don\u2019t have friends so I wouldn\u2019t know) and a lot of Indie games (relaxing no stress kinda stuff). I love all music but my favorites are anywhere in the realm of indie rock/pop/folk/idk. I also enjoy anime and cartoons. I love animals! I\u2019m sorry that scatter brain is kicking in but I met this dog at the humane society named Charlie brown and he\u2019s so cute! A little on the old and fat side (like a little doggie log) but he has the heart of a puppy. Anyways I also enjoy microscopy and attempting (but failing at) calligraphy. I\u2019m looking to try D&amp;D as well. I also, enjoy running and sports eve though at the moment I\u2019m a little out of shape. OH! I also love food as well. OHHHHH!

The first one I had was when I was 5, he was my neighbor and we would eat breakfast together and play video games. Sadly, a couple months later he passed away from stomach cancer. I didn\u2019t understand at the time but I knew I missed him. Fast forward to elementary, I was best friends with a girl and we wrote songs together trying to make a band. I always had crazy ideas but teachers always limited me and made me feel like they weren\u2019t possible. In 5th grade, she called me weird and drifted off to a new set of friends.\n\nIn middle school, I was a loner. I was my extroverted self but everyone seemed to only judge, they\u2019d say I was funny but then go talk shit behind my back. I got bullied everyday and found my escape through video games. I had friends but they were fake, I knew they\u2019d talk shit behind my back but I was desperate to want friends.\n\nI\u2019m in high school now and I really want a best friend. I want someone to talk to everyday and hang out and do stupid things. I am a quiet person now but I am fun and goofy when I get comfortable. I was bullied for years and that took away all my self confidence. I played a sport and joined clubs to make friends but it seems like they already found their group.

I do not know what to do to help him.", "author": "Seabubble3", "self_text": "Background: My friend, \"Peter,\" and I were best friends throughout college for 2 years. Both of us generally struggled to make friends but I believe this could've been a product of our college environment. He is two years older than me so he is graduated while I am still in university. After graduation he moved across the country for work and has been there for nearly 1 year.\n\nWe keep in touch regularly but I am currently studying abroad so the time difference + new experiences means I usually cannot text as much as I normally do. To make it worse, I am not an active texter to begin with. Recently I accidently left him on read and forgot to respond. I had plans with flatmates to travel and ended up not texting him for 10 days. When I did text him he opened up and revealed he felt abandoned and felt that he must've done something to offend me. I was taken aback because in my head I truly just opened his message and forgot to reply. Peter then opened up and revealed he is having a horrible time in his new city. He is not making friends, not meeting people, spends his time alone, has few hobbies, etc... He is on medication and (was) seeing a therapist.\n\nI understand depression is a mental illness - I do not want anyone to think I am assuming it can be fixed by just \"trying harder.\"\n\nI have recommended he try and seek out new hobbies, reach out to people at work for lunch more often, find a weekly club to join, etc. Peter has told me that he does indeed have people who seem to try and befriend him, but he is so judgemental and constantly assumes people have ill-intentions that he cannot bring himself to want to be friends with anyone (e.g. \"this girl was really nice to me, but she didn't talk to me the first month at work so she must want to take advantage of me for something - why else would she start talking to me\"). I am at a loss for what to do because I feel uncomfortable being the only person for him to depend on when I am literally over 5 hours away by plane at any given moment. I have even considered reaching out to his parents but he told me that he believes they do not care about his problems (this is not true - his parents are kind and loving people).\n\nOnce again, I know depression is not as simple as just going out and making friends or finding new hobbies. But Peter makes it feel like he is dependent on me for support and happiness which is difficult when I haven't seen him in a year, and probably will not see him in multiple years because I am still in university. Like I said, he is on medication and was seeing a therapist and I'm not sure what to do at this point to help him.\n\nTldr: Best friend moved to the other side of the country and hates it. He is taking meds and was seeing a therapist but is generally so pessimistic that he rebukes every suggestion I give him to try to get better. I get the impression that he is solely dependent on me, which is difficult for me because I live so far away and am still in University trying to graduate. ", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

The first year we were mostly acquaintances, but I hadn't had any friends since middle school so him even talking to me was a miracle. I ended up making friends with everyone in that class and am even living with 2 of them right now.\n\nHim and I hung out a lot during that summer, that's where the friendship really grew. We would stay up all night talking on the phone and I told him my tragic backstory \u2122 and he told me his.\n\nNext year of school starts and my boyfriend has gone away for college. Every time he visits me we just do sexy things and I feel like nothing more than a blow-up doll.\nI tell best friend about this and he gives me plenty of advice. I appreciate it very much, but most of it obviously involves confrontation with boyfriend. Me being too scared of being left can't do it. Cycle for the next few months ends up being:\nUpdate friend on situation, friend gives advice, me can't take advice, situation gets worse, repeat.\n\nI'd like to say here that I never just dumped my problems on him. He was the one who insisted I tell him, but he never told me his problems back even though I wanted to help him too.\n\nAround December he's starting to become distant. Not texting me as often at first, then ignoring me completely in class. I can't take this. I breakdown in class and leave. It was also right before Christmas break, so I had gotten him a gift before this started happening. His main in Smash Bros is Kirby so I got him a little Kirby figurine.\nAt the end if class I give it to him and say, \"Here's your present, you can throw it away if you want\". He says, \"Why would I throw it away\" but at that point I'm already in tears and out the door.\nHe messages me that night. I'm so salty and confused and hurt that I just point out that he doesn't have to text me because I got him a gift and he'll feel bad if he's not nice to me. He apologizes and says he's just been dealing with some feelings. I understand and after a talk we are now better friends than ever.\n\nShortly after my friend says that he wants to hangout and talk. We do that all the time so I don't understand why he's being so serious about it but say okay.\n\nWe're in my car in a bowling alley parking lot when he drops the bomb.\n\"I've had a crush on you all this time.\"\nHonestly to be honest not that surprised, as he was caring for me more than he was our other female friends.\nAlso am very surprised because at that point in time I didn't believe anyone was capable of really liking me. Or loving me. Hence the abusive relationship.\nBut that's exactly why he told me, so I would know someone could like me. Someone could love me. Not so he could get in my pants.\nWe both cry and I say thank you, unsure of how else to handle situation. It was a very sweet and brave thing for someone to do.\n\nTime goes by.\nHe comes to my graduation.\nThat's the last time I saw him as my best friend.\n\nWe never really hung out over that summer. He had 2 jobs and my job was short staffed. I could feel the distance growing between us so I made plans to hang out at the bowling alley. We played pool and it was like the distance never happened.\n\nThat was the last time we hung out.\n\nI didn't want to let him go. He was distancing himself from me just like before but now I didn't see him everyday so it was easier for him to do so. I tried so hard to text him and keep in touch, but once he decides to do something he is set on it.\n\nI move away from home. Only 2 hours away, but I obviously won't be around much anymore. I ask if I can see him before I leave. He says yes.\n\nI come to his house. His birthday was during the Summer and despite everything I still got him a present. He likes Sudoku and Math so I got him this huge book of this game that combines both. He says thank you. I also got him this pendant. It's one of those moon phase memory things you see advertised on Facebook and whatnot all the time. Cost me a bit of money, but I thought it was worth it for him.\nWhat was the moon phase? The first day we ever met. The first day of school with him. He said thank you.\nThen we parted ways.\n\nI thought he would try to keep in contact after that. Nope.\nCouple of months go bye. Out on the town with my roommate. Get home to a message from him saying.\n\"Sorry for being away so much, but can you call me when you get home? I have something I need to talk about with you.\"\n\nI call him immediately.\nHe basically friendship breaks up with me.\nSays that he's constantly worried about me and my well being. Says he can't keep falling for me. Says he hopes my situation get better. I say I understand. He says he doesn't know if he will come back. And that I'm the best friend he's ever had so far. End of conversation.\n\nNow, 6 months later, I still have dreams about him. About how we make up and are best friends again. Or at least friends.\nI want for us to be friends again.

Could Use a Friend", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "For the past five years things have just been super rough for me. I was in a relationship with someone who was emotionally abusive, I gained weight because of lifestyle change, lost friends, experienced close family deaths, it's just been rough.  \n\n\nI'd appreciate finding someone who is easy to talk with, willing to exchange photos, talk about daily life, send random snaps, and isn't going to ghost me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA bit about me: I grew up with a family who was Republican and Christian. It was a weird life for me. Lots of weaseling out of bills from my parents, no hot water, CPS called a few times but nothing happened, and all the while I was pretty brainwashed to still love them. It was weird because I hated them for not paying their bills and KNEW they were bad people, but still stuck by them for so many years. I am 29/M and hate that I screwed up so much in life in terms of friends, high school, and missing so many connections. So there's a lot of regret and hating myself with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the relationship, I was going through an incredibly rough patch in life and she was there for me. We dated for six years, she wasn't someone I was attracted to physically but she had this way about her. She forced herself into my life any chance she got, sabotaged a lot of female friendships that I had, and while I was once a very active college baseball player, my energy went low and my weight went high.  \n\n\nThe cherry on top of all of this, is my dad attempting suicide. It's one thing to go through a rough break-up and question your past, it's another to see that your dad is trying to kill himself. Growing up he never worked more than a half year or so at any job. He was emotionally abused by my mother, belittled, had anger issues, etc. She really messed with his mental health. I used to think my dad was this lazy loser, but come to find out he was just tired. Beaten down mentally for so many years and listening to my narcissistic mother talk so badly about him to her family and friends, and come to find out he struggles with bipolar depression.  \n\n\nI grew up on my mom's side with things. She made sure of it. We spent time with her parents, her cousin, her friends, etc. All I heard about was how bad my dad was and how lazy and pathetic he was. Up until about a year ago, I bought into it and believed it. That was all I had heard about in terms of him and from various sources. I got more involved in his life because he reached out to me, and kind of discovered the truth about my mom and her manipulative impulses, and cut off complete contact with her. Being almost 30 myself, unmarried, no friends, and realizing my own mental abuse going on, I started questioning my own happiness and sanity, and like I said earlier...just wishing I could go back in high school with a clear mind, without the narcissism and abuse.  \n\n\nI have always gotten along best with females growing up. I saw and heard a lot of creepy things from a lot of guys. From classmates, to teammates, to teachers, to random guys on the street, etc. I just never related well to guys. All the while, I adopted the toxic masculinity myself for so long. Again, due to the narcissism and what I was \"groomed\" to feel like I need to act and feel.  \n\n\nNOW I am liberal democrat who is a feminist, trying to right my wrongs even if it means being alone and no longer having a family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope to hear from you!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

{"post_id": "b0dk3a", "created_utc": 1552427152, "title": "Being completely cut off and losing two close friends.", "author": "wafflestrikesagain", "self_text": "I\u2019ve never posted on this board before, so I apologize if I\u2019ve done anything wrong, but here\u2019s my story:\n\nI feel that I should mention that I\u2019m a female in high school and I\u2019ve never really had girl friends prior to these two. Chiefly because I\u2019m socially awkward and barely have any friends regardless of gender, and I was afraid something like the following would happen. I also feel obligated to mention that I have an acquired taste of humor.\n\nI met my two friends over a year ago, I\u2019ll refer to them and Rachel and Monica. I knew of them prior to us becoming friends, but it wasn\u2019t until last year that I began speaking to them. They had been best friends since middle school, I was sort of the outsider. It was nice having friends that were girls, they were easy to relate to and it was just very different from what I was accustomed to. \n\nFast forward a year, I sat with Monica and Rachel during lunch, I would help them in class, we\u2019d talk outside of school, etc. I noticed early on, before I even began speaking to the two, that Monica and Rachel were almost one entity, ie, if one is on the volleyball team, so is the other. This didn\u2019t really bother me, I noticed that a lot of the girls at my school are like this, I didn\u2019t really care then. \n\nA couple of months ago, I jokingly called Monica, \u201cmelodramatic.\u201d She flipped, only proving my point. I noticed she became a bit distant and wouldn\u2019t talk to me, but she would text me occasionally, or engage in conversation, but only if I prompted it. This lasted for about a week or so, maybe two. Rachel and I were still fine, I\u2019d talk to her everyday, though I would have to say Monica and I were closer, she\u2019d come to me if she had any problems and vice versa. The issue she had seemed so negligible, hence me calling her melodramatic. \n\nShe took what I said the wrong way, and I get it, so I spoke to one of my guy friends, I\u2019ll call him Joey. Joey said he thinks maybe I should apologize, and at the time I hadn\u2019t even realized what she was mad at me for, I just knew she was mad at me. I told her I was sorry for anything that I did/said and that I didn\u2019t mean it the way she took it. She told me it\u2019s okay, apology accepted, but she didn\u2019t like me calling her melodramatic. Okay... really? I kept telling her it was sarcasm, but for some reason she didn\u2019t see it that way.\n\nAnyway, this happened a couple of months ago, fast forward a little more. Now, we don\u2019t speak to each other at all. Not even me and Rachel. I didn\u2019t notice it for a while, but whenever I would try to start a conversation, Monica would make it as short lived as she could, she\u2019d respond with one word answers, not make any eye contact, and she wouldn\u2019t prompt any conversations herself. One day Rachel went from sitting next to me, to sitting next to Monica, and even though she literally moved one seat up, I knew something had shifted between us. \n\nI began picking up on little things, Monica would seek help for classwork and homework from kids she\u2019s never even spoken to, the two would never include me in conversation anymore, etc. Rachel joined the softball team, she\u2019s never shown interest in it until Monica, a girl who has played softball for over a decade, mentioned tryouts started soon. Rachel isn\u2019t her own person, if Monica did something, she follows. When Monica stopped speaking to me, so did she. It honestly annoys me, I don\u2019t know why either of them stopped speaking to me, especially Rachel considering I\u2019ve done absolutely nothing to her. \n\nI still sit with them as it\u2019s the middle of the school year and seating arrangements in classrooms and the cafeteria have been established since week one. It\u2019s pretty awkward, we make eye contact every so often and nothing. I got a haircut and everyone and their mother except my two closest (girl) friends complimented me. I know Rachel started dating, some guy is her first boyfriend and I don\u2019t even know his name, the only reason I know they started dating is because I saw them at a local restaurant and almost dropped my tray staring, a mutual friend confirmed their relationship. \n\nWhy don\u2019t I try reaching out? Because I have tried, with Monica particularly. I can\u2019t be the one who is always apologizing for things I\u2019m not even sorry for, I can\u2019t be the one always starting conversations and entertaining the other person, that\u2019s not how friendships work. I won\u2019t try with Rachel because it seems that she has already made up her mind, I\u2019m sure Monica lied to her or explicitly told her to cut off all ties with me and Rachel willingly listened.\n\nThis has never happened to me before, I\u2019m a misanthrope and I rarely speak to people, so the people I do speak to mean a lot to me. I\u2019ve never had girl friends before because of the stereotype, they\u2019re catty, bitchy, dramatic, etc. They proved all of this to be correct, and while I\u2019m sure there are girls who make excellent friends, this experience has been less than likable. I\u2019m content with my guy friends, I like them very much, we have a lot in common, there\u2019s nothing to dislike, but having girl friends was different, and I\u2019m just upset it had to end this way. I don\u2019t even know what I did wrong.\n\n*Edit*: I just want to make it clear that I already apologized for calling Monica melodramatic and obviously, to no avail. I also wanted to mention why I called her melodramatic\u2014 essentially, she was infuriated that someone she disliked bought her a bottle of water. I jokingly responded by saying the guy was insane for doing so and proceeded to call her out on her non-issues.

In the beginning of our friendship (first 2-3 years), I didn't have any feelings for her other than thinking she was pretty cute. After we started hanging out alot and I got to know her at a more personal level I started crushing on her and let her know. \n\nShe told me she wasn't interested, and I was cool with just being friends since we talked pretty much every day.  I'd never been in a similar situation before so I didn't know that the \"crush\"/jealousy feelings would keep popping up. \n\nIn her case, she's had very bad luck with men. After I got to know her, it was easy to tell she had a \"type\" that she did prefer. The problem, from my perspective, is that the type of guy she is attracted to is generally the type that looks for a \"trophy wife\" in a sense. I'm aware that this is a generalization based on style/looks/culture so I can't say with surety.  Unfortunately in her case, she would not be \"their type\" in alot of cases because she prides herself in her intelligence whereas those types of dudes are generally intimidated/annoyed by intelligent women in addition to not being considerate in regards to the mental health issues she has that they would need to deal with.\n\nSince I had a crush on her, and she knows I had a crush on her, I think she feels that my advice in regards to men is just rooted in jealousy so it falls on deaf ears. Personally I do admit that some of it may be jealousy, but for the most part  I hate seeing my friends suffer and our conversations aren't the same when she's in a shitty mood.\n\nThe friend part of me knows that I can't say much because these are things that have to be learned through experience and it will come off as jealousy. The part of me that likes her is a bit hurt that she wrote me off so easily (ofc that's my own selfish issue tho). \n\nThe primary question I have is:\nHow do I get rid of the jealousy and attachment feelings while salvaging the friendship? I've tried dating, but I still don't seem to connect with most other girls in the same way or the ones that I do connect with don't work out after longer periods of time.\n\nAdditionally I've noticed that I'm much more weary of befriending girls I think are cute now. Since it seems to affect my mental health, is it still worth it?\n\nTldr: I developed a crush on one of my closest friends about halfway thru our friendship and I'm conflicted due to feelings because I'm aware of her preferences, which i think will continue to hurt her. Don't want to end the friendship but don't want to be the emotional tampon for said issues.\n", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I usally work a lot of hours and cant keep up woth him but when winter comes I am usally cut back to 40hrs only 4 days. During this time if he finds out im not working as much he will fake sick just to try and keep up with me. Now this all seems a little abnoxious but I just dont think we see eye to eye on much anymore.

He also gets all disapointed if im doing somthing else when he has time to play.\nNow i know this is dumb bc its seems like its just about games but its more than that.

You know, the kind liable to ask how your day is going out of the middle of nowhere and with whom you can exchange songs, dumb memes and deep discussions. Sometimes all at once. \n\n\n\n*If you are someone who is not going to bother reading the following wall, I encourage you to click the lil' X on top of this tab now. Thank you!* :) \n\n\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info (AKA full autobiography) about me:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate.\n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned career, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, which I am dealing with as best as I can - although recently, things have been on the mend - enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am somewhat stigmatized against the latter by some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not, in fact, a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandise and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed. \n\n- Gainfully *un*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work.\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Automata, WoW, Bioshock series, Prey, Metal Gear Solid, the &gt;Observer_, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. \nHonestly, for whatever reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nAs always, looking for people to play with and gaming suggestions - I just got burned out on RImworld, and, like, don't know what else to paly :&lt; \n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favourite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favourite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loathe cheap jumpscares they are so enamoured with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n\n- My sense of humour is possibly the worst, and I take pride in having offsnsive memes for every occasion ready. Needless to say, I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile stuff. \n\n- My main hobby right now is Airsoft. I spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together since I ordered most of my gear from companies in Russia. \nThe centrepiece of my collection is my plate carrier which came with full kevlar inserts and was used by Russian anti-insurgency ops. \n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I think it is time to give up trying to categorize what I like by genre, and instead do it by what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord) I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n\nSome of my favourite bands are Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Muse, Green Day, Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, NIN and many, many more - if it is not obvious by this point, I am so edgy that I (used to) cut myself :D\nRight now, I am bopping to this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khchqRIPN4U&amp;list=RDQMQiMosF1B0&amp;index=7). Nothing special, but the animation &amp; beat is nice.\n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%, due to a certain affinity for slithering neck-ties and positive human qualities like ambition, narcissism and general douchebaggery :D \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. Stuf like lack o punctuatuion impropar gramar to short n generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit.\n\nAgain, rephrasing the last part for dozens of people who simply don't get it: tell me something about yourself. Put a bit of effort into it. If your message is short and does nothing to attract my attention, I will not respond. \n\nAlso, here are some pictures of [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0), because why not? \n\n *Please, PMs only*!

She's got a very bad attitude. She has a great life and is very privileged and is very lucky to have it as good as she does, but she's constantly complaining about everything. And I mean EVERYTHING. She's not depressed, Just very negative. And she's constantly putting herself down at every opportunity. And then she gets mad and disagrees whenever anyone objects or contradicts. I've given up trying to negate those statements, but many still try. What's most aggravating is that a lot of what she complains about are very trivial things, or things that most people have to deal with. She complains about working \"all the time\" but she only works three, sometimes four, hours per shift three, sometimes four, times a week. And her job is very easy. All she has to do is walk around, fold things, and occasionally talk to people. And she gets paid very well for it. And she complains about the noise on the bus preventing her from sleeping, as if everyone else is being so rude by talking on the bus. And she complains about having to pay for HALF of the price for her car, only $50 a month for the much-more-than-fifty-dollar car insurance bill, and gas. She got a car that she couldn't afford and is upset that she had to pay half and that now she has to slowly pay off the other half (which was the original agreement) and didn't even know how much her car insurance actually was until I told her that there's no way it's only fifty a month and she asked her mom. She complains about absolutely everything. And it's much harder to hear when I and most other people have it much worse. And she yelled at me and our other friend today and was very sassy about it because she was tired of us always talking on the bus with her sitting in between. We hadn't even begun talking, this was immediately after we got onto the bus. And I was just asking Emily how her day was and she snapped at me like that. Yes the other friend and I talk a lot and Emily does usually sit in the middle but nobody is forcing her to, and we have every right to talk on the bus. I told her that she could always move seats and (as per usual when I say something valid to her) she just mumbled a response that's really more of a jab at me. I'm just so sick of her attitude and both me and our other friend have tried to calmly talk to her about it but every time she just throws a huge fit about it and acts like we're being jerks to her. She makes us so mad every day. We've literally had to call each other just to vent about her. But I love Emily when she's in a good mood. We have a lot in common and she's fun to be with and I love a lot about her. We've been friends a very long time. I don't want to end my friendship with her. But I'm very close to sternly confronting her about it. I don't know what else to do. And I doubt it'll work. Our other friend is ready to tear her a new one. What should I do?

How are you!?\n\nRecently shifted to an independent flat, sharing the space with an amazing 3 year old mutt. He is a great companion.\n\nI am doing PhD- so to a max, I get out of my flat only twice a week for some meeting/seminar. I am trying my best to get out at least thrice a week, on alternate days. And spend a few hours reading/writing at my college. It is comforting to have people around, to just know that there is a presence. But I miss talking. Or just laughing at jokes.\n\nI am also in a wonderful relationship with a guy, around my age. Verrrryyy understanding and patient. He lives a bit far- so we meet once a week and also, even if we could meet more, I do not want to parasite my need for social companionship on him. He has his friends and I should have mine? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a lot of people whom I know, like acquaintances, whom I could call and hangout with. There have been a few people at different points who have been great friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut lately, at least last 4 years, I meet men and most just want to fuck or maybe have a relationship. They never say it directly. But. This dude said he dreamt of cuddling me/another tried to kiss and I just brushed it off- but. And this all- especially after I very clearly say that \"We are good friends. I am not looking for a romantic relationship.\" And I try my best to not behave in any way which could mislead the other. And this whole process is also tedious- having to constantly censor myself to ensure the other doesn't think I want sex/relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want to have a friend, whom I can sit with, have some tea and talk or just be around each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd. Most of my women friends are out of state now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd when I think of going out for any event, like a play or art gallery. I have already played out the entire evening in my head. And I just feel it will come to no use. Like not that the people won't be great. There are tons of people who have varied interests. But I want to be able to have (humorously) serious conversations. Where people can share without feeling weak/embarrassed. I want to talk about what love is, how people relate to each other, why we fight, what are healthy habits for a relationship, what is anger and so on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI miss emotional intimacy and the spontaneity of younger friendships.

I be never been in a relationship. And right now I\u2019m going through an I don\u2019t need to be in a relationship. I love myself phase for some reason.  I randomly messaged someone reconnected I used to go to school with in like the seventh grade out of boredom saying hey long time no see!

Instead it turned into a whole catch up and adding on other social media. \n  \nI learned a lot.  he grew up being bullied and picked on, lonely. And told me that\u2019s why he talks so much because he grew up without someone to talk to.\n\n  And I felt sorry for him. He said I can message him whenever I\u2019m bored. He\u2019s been giving me advice on guys and how they all just want one thing then leave. Stay single it\u2019s better.     Yet he\u2019s lonely. So I hooked him up in a groupchat with another girl I met who acts like she has no friends. They get along quite well and are attracted to each other, so I\u2019m happy with that.  Since my group of friends are pissed off with me talking about myself too much. I\u2019ve ended up telling him random things, and he listens. I tell him about all my crushes. \n\nNot long ago he messaged me why I deleted the photo of me on my story. I asked which one then remembered and told him because I got self conscious of what people thought because I\u2019ve been posting way too much. He told me not to care, you\u2019re beautiful _____! \n\nIt makes me so happy to be showered with compliments. Why do guys do that? But I wouldn\u2019t date him. Also I understand the Quote always used by men that they can\u2019t understand women.    I  don\u2019t understand boys/men.   Why is he stalking my photos.\n\n   He also asks the girl I hooked him up with to spam him her selfie, and she does. Since I\u2019m pretty Pervy I can freely talk about hot guys and stuff related to sex unlike with my girlfriends. And by sex I mean looking down on people I used to go school with who went sleeping around.  \nWhenever I told him about hot guys he\u2019d randomly call me kinky bitch.   \n\nOkay? Is this how guys talk?  I\u2019ve never had a guy friend to talk to. And I wanted one to get over my intidimadtion of good looking guys. Guess that prayer was answered. He\u2019s not great looking, but just knowing how to talk to and that they\u2019re just human is helping me get over it I guess because I feel more calm around everyone I meet now. \n\n  I googled stuff about men and loneliness and read they need to be around women. Where as women can do fine being single. He\u2019s not creepy at all. Seems like a nice genuinely smart kid looking for a bestie to give advice to. \n", "subreddit": "friendship"}

We aren't good friends but his wife and him have come over for dinner once and she told me he never does this to any other co-workers.\n\nTL;DR is the title.\n\nSorry for long post.\n\nMy 35M (not sure if matters) co-worker, caring, loving father, diligent worker, was on sick leave for 2 weeks earlier this year, the reason wasn't disclosed, I suspected a burn-out and mentioned to people that it must be taken seriously. When he came back for about a month, he thanked me and told me in private that he always liked me but now he respects me. I assumed it is related to the sick leave and my comment about burn-out but it's not exactly clear so I asked if he wanted to talk about what happened to him. He said: \"some other time\". We never got to talk about it but he mentioned once when we were alone that his wife now refuse to play with the baby twins. That made me worry as I now think she may suffer depression and is affecting him but I might be assuming stuff. He also started smoking again, a habit I believe he has quit many years ago.\nA few days ago I mentioned that I have holiday soon and I'll visit him and his babies. The office (very small team) talked about but nothing happened for a year or so. I recently had my own baby so it's a little difficult for me, plus I live hours away; so I thought holiday time is perfect. He said he would like that. Then he wrote on a piece of paper \"THANKS\" and showed it to me. Nobody is next to us, we were alone.\nI didn't know why he's thanking me but I don't want to dismiss his feelings so I patted on his shoulder and said \"aww, thanks man.\"\nToday he's sick again and he won't come back for awhile. My supervisor tried to talk to him but he's never a talkative guy so all we know is it is psychological. I feel like I must do my best to help him but I believe he also values his own space...\nThe visit is not due for 2 weeks.\nI have his home address. He has smartphone etc.\n\nDo men handle depression differently? How to help? What can I do that's not weird? Please help I really am worried for him.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Within this past year we moved to different cities after college graduation. I expected some distance but not a complete cut off. A precursor to this involves some issues that I\u2019ve had with her because of some tendencies she\u2019s had with our friendship. She is the type of friend that you never see if she has a significant other in her life. She can also be incredibly inconsiderate and always flakes on plans last minute for selfish reasons such as she just doesn\u2019t want to go anymore. Sometimes she just doesn\u2019t show up with no warning or explanation at all - and then likes to act like nothing happened the next time you see her. She also does not respect boundaries when it comes to my boyfriend\u2019s friends, after we asked her to not get involved with any of them so that we could all stay friends. needless to say, she got involved with several of his friends (at the same time) and now our friends groups can\u2019t hang out together. She also does this thing where I\u2019ll be mid text vent to her usually very upset about something and she\u2019ll answer the first text then just read them and never answer me. \nSo once we moved I became tired of constantly putting in the effort to our friendship. Our friendship completely died. Be aware that I did not cut off contact to her, I just simple stopped making so much of an effort to talk to her. I haven\u2019t heard from her in roughly two months and the one time we were to meet up and hang out she stopped answering and then texted me the next day saying her phone broke. \nLooking back at this it kinda seems like she doesn\u2019t care about me or my feelings at all. She basically cut off all communication to me and I even reached out saying that I missed her espies everything and that I\u2019d like to talk and sort things out. She ignored my message and even though I am not surprised, I am hurt by it. At this point I don\u2019t know if it is even worth it to try and repair our friendship. It\u2019s really difficult for me to grasp this because we have a ton of history and we really have been best friends for some time. I\u2019m not sure what to do, my sister told me \u201cstop watering dead plants\u201d and I\u2019ve just had the hardest time leaving it this way. \n\nTLDR: My best friend of 4 years cut off all communication with me after she moved because I stopped putting all of the effort into our friendship due to her inconsiderate/selfish tendencies.

So yeah I decided to give this sub one last try, as I say in the title. I've already ghosted some people here ngl, but I really only ghost someone as a last resort. I believe most of you can understand this, sometimes you just don't get along with some people, thats' life. But if anyone reading this got ghosted by me or ghosted me at some point, feel free to give it another try.\n\nAnyway, a bit about me: I'm really into video games. Yeah I know, seems like most people here are, but what can I say? I really love it. Also I'm not exactly a nice person, I really try to be, but I'm not, I guess you should know that. I love talking about \"controvesial stuff\", like politics and religion. Afterall, you won't get knowledge about those things if you don't talk about them.\n\nHonestly there isn't much else to say about me, I know this will sound like every single other post here but I'm just a boring person with a boring life. There really isn't much to it, sometimes it just feels like I'm killing some time while I wait for my time to come.\n\nOkay so, if you like video games too you should know I've been playing a lot on PC currently, (mostly because I couldn't play on it for almost one year since it was not working properly) mostly Payday 2 and I started to play Warframe recently, I'm still surprised at how amazing this game is, specially since its a free game. I also play EU4. Feel free to text me if you dont play video games at all, but it would be nice to have some people to play with too. I also have a 3DS and a Wii U.\n\nWell I really don't know whtat else to say. I will try to reply everyone who texts me but please don't be an asshole, I won't tolerate any kind of discrimination and if you see yourself as a conservative you should probably not even text me. I would prefer to talk with people around my age, but I really dont see why I shouldn't talk to someone older. And I know I may sound like a dick saying this but I would prefer to not talk with people from USA. Will I reply to you and try to build a friendship is you're from USA and text me? Yes, of course. But think twice about texting me if you're from USA.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, I don't hate Americans or anything like that. It's kinda hard to explain why I say this, I guess most people not from USA would undertand me. Idk, to put it bluntly it kinda feels like most americans don't give a shit about anything not related to their country.

Since then, I just haven't really been included in anything with them, and I only seem to matter to them when I'm around, which is not that often because I'm the only one trying to make plans.\n\nI'd really like to just have people to talk to, about anything, really. And maybe actually have close friends again instead of watching people be close with each other.\n\nI don't mean to just be a downer, though! I do want to meet new people, make new connections, etc. so here's a bit about me:\n\nI do taxes for a living at the moment, trying to get into grad school in another (neighboring) country in the fall of 2020. \n\nI like succulents, DnD/various RPGs (working on my own system which I'd be happy to talk about!), hiking/traveling, lots of sci-fi, Steven Universe, and woodcarving/art in general. I also do graphic and web design, but that's more of a professional hobby.\n\nAlso thought I'd separate music on its own because I have started to get involved in the local music scene a little. I play organ/keyboard but haven't performed anywhere yet, I just have music connections and design merchandise for a local band. But, I also really like The Talking Heads, Parliament/Funkadelic, Cambrian Explosion, Black Sabbath, Dio, Rammstein, Hozier, Tame Impala, ... I could keep going but hopefully that's enough to give an idea of the music I like.\n\nFeel free to ask me questions here or pm me for other ways to contact me!

I've been wanting to post here for a while, but my anxiety said otherwise. I'm looking for someone to just kind of chill with on days off or unwind with after work (my sleep schedule is something awful). I work 2nd shift, usually anywhere between seven and nine hour shifts a day with Saturdays and Wednesdays off for the time being. My boyfriend and I currently have opposite schedules, so by the time I get home, he's already passed out (I always hate bugging him with work related stuff since we work at the same place anyways). I'm not the best with words, so go easy on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings to understand about me:\n\n* I have stupid anxiety over really weird things. Kind of hard to explain.\n* I cat nap a lot because I'm usually sore from running myself ragged at work and I also have a few medical problems that cause me to casually nap when I don't wanna.\n* I'm really not super into politics/religious stuff, so I won't be much fun with that topic.\n* Chill environments are the best environments for me. High stress is no bueno.\n* Sometimes, I give short answers and most times, it's because I don't feel good or I'm sleepy. I always let people know when I'm busy or don't want to talk.\n* I disappear sometimes just to spend time with me, myself, and I. Mostly just to nap or decompress. (Occasionally my boyfriend when we have time off together.)\n* Voice chat makes me a lil nervous, so it'll take a few for me to not be completely awkward. \n* With me, patience is key. I am very forgetful about things. I have trouble remembering days, times, things said when I'm stressed or tired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStuff and things I'm pretty into:\n\n* Video games: Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Stardew Valley, Farm Together, Minecraft, Kingdom Hearts, Yooka Laylee, Dino D-Day, Crypt of the Necrodancer, any 8bit nostalgia grind and quirky, stupid games that people love to hate. PS4, Atari, Xbox (which I basically just use for netflix anymore)\n* Cats (other animals too, but mostly cats). We have three of them and they are pretty much our children. No matter how much I threaten them with the deadly water gun or lord vacuum, they still love me and I still love them.\n* Dark humor, awful memes, dad jokes, sarcasm, the like. I lack witty comebacks and embarrass myself most times, but I do it with style (not really, I'm bad at that too).\n* Dinosaurs are my jam. I have also, somehow, picked up a habit of collecting plush triceratops for every holiday.\n* Weird music is pretty neat. I don't have any one specific preference for music.\n* I'm sure I'll think of something else later, probably.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I'm looking for someone closer to my age to chill with. If you have any questions, comments or words of wisdom, feel free to send me a message on here. I use reddit,  discord and steam for most of my communication purposes.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I'll probably cry if you make me watch a horror movie though, not going to lie. \n\nI like any type of music, but right now my music taste is mainly indie/rock/alternative kind of jams.

I definitely want to learn tricks though, but it's hard when you deadass eat asphalt every other day already.\n\nI\u2019m hoping to be a bit more girly too, all my friends say I\u2019m a trap because I look and act like a guy yet they\u2019re 80% sure I don\u2019t have a dong (if I do, it\u2019d probably be bigger than theirs)\n\nThat's only scratching the surface, I have a lot of stories from my experiences of being a dumb and oblivious teenager, and I'd love to hear yours too!\n\nIt'd be super awesome if you could send me a small blurb of who you are and what you would like to talk about!!

What's your favorite anime?\" \"Hey. Let's talk. Maybe we will continue, if we don't. I'll find someone else.\" What kind of friend talks with you one day and then blocks you? What kind of friend allows this crap that keeps happening and than acts like they feel the same way. Unlike everyone here, I actually feel a certain way and act a certain way differently from everyone here. Maybe, you don't see even though..I'm here...I don't know what they want from me. Yeah...I don't talk much...wanna know why? Why should I bother communicating with someone who PM's me in my private messages or wants to talk to me. Are they even interested in me? If you were a real friend. maybe, you wouldn't \"chat\" with me for a day and then toss me in a imaginary internet trash bin.\n\nI mean...I wouldn't mind if you discord me or messaged me on reddit. Just...don't be a fake. I'm tired of fakes and nobody's.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

She is literally the most positive and optimistic. At some point, I realized that I had feelings for her and it became unbearable. I had to see her everyday because of the projects we worked on together so I felt like I just had to get it off my chest. After that, we both spectacularly failed to communicate our emotions to each other: I never really wanted to date her but she (understandably) thought the things I said were trying to push her that way. She told me we couldn't work together anymore and, eventually, she ended our friendship 'forever.' The last time we spoke was almost 4-5 months ago, I sent her a letter a few months ago apologizing for a litany of issues I brought to her, mainly that she thought I was manipulative of her, which wasn't entirely true nor my intent: These were issues she never told me but I had pieced together from mutual friends and therapists.\n\nShe has a lot of issues, but I really cared about her nonetheless. She's lied to me about important professional things, but I've come to forgive her because I care about her, now only as a friend. There is literally 50 times more to this story but these are really the relevant parts. We cared about each other a lot, we both hurt each other a lot, and now she doesn't want to be friends anymore. I feel so used too. I've been in pain for so long. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety as a result of this experience which should tell you how serious this all meant to me (and her). I just want to have a normal, positive friendship with her again.\n\nSome of our mutual friends say that I need to move on, let her be. Others say to just give her more time and space before contacting her again. I don't know what to do. Please help me, I've been struggling for so so long. I'm so lost knowing that someone I really cared about has walked out of my life and isn't looking back.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

'why would I hang out with the awkward guy who I don't feel I can be close with when I have other friends' type of deal... And I've always held some tacit assumptions that, when I realized I had them, make no sense. Things like, if I ask someone to hang out and they say they're busy, my inherent first thought is that they may not be busy, they may just not want to hang out - so pressing them on the issue like suggesting another time to hang out will just cause them to become uncomfortable. Doubtless that SOMETIMES happens, but it's always my first assumption... Finally, I think whenever ANYONE is hanging out with people they worry to some degree whether the people they're with like them, but for me it's a constant need not to feel liked, but to avoid being disliked. The distinction matters, because what happens is that I spend a large portion of the time being quiet or at least passive, and then whenever I get a moment of genuine connection with someone - we're talking about something real and sort of trusting each other - I draw blanks on what to say. It's like I'm caught in disaster-avoidance mode, and the second I realize someone is enjoying themselves and I don't need to worry about whether they like hanging out or not, I don't know what to do... because my default mode is to tacitly assume they don't like me and try to be as inoffensive as possible.\n\nAll of that said, I think the end result is that I unintentionally keep people at a distance. I mean, I desperately want to form deep friendships, but I realized that if I treat people like I don't know whether they enjoy my company or not, it has a kind of reciprocal effect. But now that I realize what's going on... I still don't know what to do. I've spent so long in this mode of communication that I don't know how to open up without dumping tons of emotional baggage on people, and I can't do that because I have few enough friends as it is... and really only one I get to see in person.\n\nSo yeah... Apologies for the rambling, and for the lack of any coherent question, but I guess I'm hoping someone has been in this spot and/or has some advice on moving past talking about the weather but stopping short of opening up too much and being creepy/depressing?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I think highly of weed (I posted this at 420 karma, woohoo) and don't buy the stigmas attached to it. I'm trying to work on disregarding my generalized anxiety, and be less unintentionally asocial. I'm a little long-winded, at times, but I'm also shy and insecure about how I've lived and what I've failed to do up until just recently. I'm hoping to make some friends, closer to my age is preferable but I'll reply to anyone. I don't have a lot to say about myself, but I'm happy to listen to you talk about what makes you happiest, and hear you out about any of your concerns. Feel free to comment on here first, or message/chat first, I'll get to both.\n\nHere's some interests I have:Hobby vegetable gardening, enjoying weed, walking outdoors/short hikes,  the arts (I just dabble with drawing rn, and am not very good ahah. I'd like to pick up writing and photography, too), binge watching shows/films, listening to a variety of music (reggae, rap, electronic, rock, instrumental) and I keep up with two or three anime/manga I'm into, used to be a big weeb lol.\n\nI have Skype, I can reply on reddit, I have Kik. I have Discord, but haven't used it yet and prefer the other options. The introductory part of making friends takes some effort, but I'm not the type to ghost. I don't mind only talking less than once a week, or talking everyday, but I'm hopeful about meeting a few friends regardless. Whoever took the time to read this, nice to sort of meet you! I hope your own friend search goes well and you have much luck! And lastly,\n\nIdentity stuff; I'm a 21 year old male who has always lived in Maine. I'm straight, white and consider myself asexual. I'm progressive-minded. I tend to think I'm considerate and non-judgemental, I mean, we're just people getting by with the cards we've been dealt as individuals.  \n\n\n\\*additionally (edit)\\* For anyone wondering about, or against weed/cannabis, feel free to ask serious questions, no matter what they may be. I actually enjoy learning about, knowing about and properly explaining weed to those who may have misconceptions or the wrong idea, or are looking to learn because they're curious. I'm not a researcher, but I'm an enthusiast and I'm happy to talk, even confrontational/opposing perspectives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I'm a very easy-going lad who is just looking for a squad of friends to make online and feel like myself again. I used to have a tightly-knit friend group back in the days of the ps3, but we all parted ways upon heading to college. \n\nIn short, I have made friends at college, but have struggled to find people that make me feel safe to be myself around. A lot of people like to dwell in a conversation where there is a clear wall between us. I never feel like I am able to really get to know and connect people. I don't mind just casual acquaintances, but it would be nice to meet some people that want to become best pals and just have a lot of laughs together. \n\nI'm fortunate to have a girlfriend who is very supportive of me, in addition to a close friend of mine whom I can vent to as well in times of stress. I would like to find more people to grow with and just have fun with though. I think people are put off by how overly-friendly I am, and how inclined I am to try to escape small talk by jumping into some other topics. I have a shite sense of humor and will pretty much laugh at anything goofy within reason.\n\nI am extremely passionate about music, making people laugh, talking about movies, and have dabbled in video games a bit (I too have played Dork Souls: gIt gUud Ed.). Even if you need someone to vent to, I try to be accommodating.\n\nI'm currently a Journalism student who realized he didn't like journalism just in time to have no time to make a change. I am trying not to fret about it, and the quarter-life crisis has only ignited a desire to leave my state and start over somewhere else upon graduation. \n\ntl;dr version: redhead boi looking for pals.

This is my last year in high school, our school gives us the choice of multiple trips on our last year. One of them was a 4 day trip to London.

Now, my best friend wanted to go where I went, so we went together.\n\nIt was great and such until we went on a tour on the second day there. We took the underground to Buckingham Palace and went into the park near there, after the change of guards. The thing is, he met a girl there he really likes, and the girl seemed to like him too. Since then he just left me for dead. I sat on a couch in the park, all alone, while he walked off with the girl he met.\n\nWe slept in the same room, so that night I told him how I felt about the situation. I told him I felt like I was a nobody to him at that point in time.

Whenever we meet new people, she throws herself at them and tells them her life story, her hobbies, her interests, what's she's good at, basically goes on and on and then disregards me and says something like, \"Oh yeah and she's home-schooled,\" in a mocking sort of way, I know she's joking but it's like I'm pushed aside in every conversation because she wants it to be all about her. Whenever we talk it's fine if she talks about her (and me, being a good listener and a good friend, I let her) but as soon as I talk about myself she always changes the subject or says she doesn't care (again, in a joking manner, but that doesn't make it any less hurtful). Don't even get me started on guys. I'm not interested in dating, but if I was I'd be fucked because she's desperate af and tries to get with every guy we meet just so she gets attention and fills the void. I've always had a hard time making friends because I'm more of a listener and don't talk a lot while others like to talk on and on about themselves, and being in a group chat with her just makes it worse (and makes me feel even more insecure because everyone else always likes her better than me but that's not her fault), so my only hope would be to just make some without her intervening. She has friends, boys like her, and she gets complimented all the time, but she still complains that she doesn't get the attention she wants. I don't see how I could bring this up with her because she'd just say sth like, \"I was kiddddinggg,\" And I don't want to ruin our friendship with this because I'm sensitive and can't handle a joke but I just can't help but feel like she takes the upper hand of the relationship (mostly bc I don't ask her to do anything for me or ask for attention and she does and I comply). I have a low self-esteem and when she makes petty jabs at me it hurts but if I tell her she'll accuse me of being defensive and say that she's only joking. What should I do? Should I be more assertive? Should I continue to talk about myself when she obviously doesn't care? Am I just boring and that's why nobody likes to listen to me? How do I make friends when she's like this? We're both extremely insecure, but I don't act on it and never ask for attention so I never get that attention, but that's just not me. She's there for me when I have problems and lets me vent, but I just wish she'd care what I had to say in normal conversations too, but whaddya gonna do, you can't just force someone to want to listen to you.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I make a pretty alright listener (only cause I suck at giving advice.) I'll never mind if you've got something you need to get off your chest and vent. That's what friends are for after all! Got some people pissing you off? Tell me! Got some real deep problems bugging you? Tell me about that too! Got some good stuff going on or did something you wanna brag about? Hit me up with all of that! I can try my best to help, but I can't help much with a solution unfortunately. Regardless, I wanna be there for you anyway I can! Let me be your hype man!\n\nA bit more about me\n\n\\- I've struggled with depression and loneliness in the past. I know how shitty and awful it can be to go through all of that, especially alone. Even though I don't struggle much with it anymore, some days can get pretty rough.\n\n\\- I don't drink anymore! I started getting drunk nearly every night and decided I didn't want to end up like my dad, so I decided I had to stop. I still have one beer on occasion, but never anything hard like liquor.\n\n\\-I'm an INFP.\n\n\\- I recently started watching anime, and I've gotten really (too far) into it! I'd love to hear some recommendations! So far I enjoy comedies and slice-of-life stuff.\n\n\\- Still love music! I'd love some more recommendations. Recently I've been listening to a lot of Anime OSTs and Electronic stuff. Mainly D'n'B. Anything goes, though!\n\n\\- I prefer to talk on Discord, as I have a hard time keeping up with Reddit messages/chats. Text or voice, whichever one works best for you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's pretty much it! Of course, the points from my last post still stand as well. Though, it's pretty much the same as this one except there's less text. Regardless, I look forwarding to talking to you all! Cheers!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We became a threesome friend group when my university room mate also became close friends with us and we stayed in touch whenever possible and were the go to people when we faced issues in our lives or to share happy moments with. Although we had busy lives we still made time to meet up but sometimes I did get quite annoyed when my childhood friend would show up late most of the time and take the longest time to finish her meals. She was also quite loud and it was sometimes an issue with my parents when she would come over to our home and talk loudly while my parents were around. She was just this lively person who has a very young spirit and I guess we blended well since I am more of the serious and mature type while she just goofs around me like a little kid whenever we meet. But sometimes I did wish she would behave her age and change her habits. Anyways fast forward.. she gets married and after about 3 years, she gets separated and this was when things became difficult between us. I met her several times when she was already separated from her husband and whenever I asked about him, she would say that he is okay or travelling etc and I was also in the midst of a health problem. I then had the opportunity to move to a new location and when I broke the news to her, she then told me the truth after about 9 months that she was actually separated. I was in shock and even more surprised as I knew a mutual friend was renting one of her rooms but it never crossed my mind that she was facing marital issues as the mutual friend didn't mention a word as well. At that point, considering that she was my best friend other than my room mate, I felt cheated and very disappointed that she never confided in me or my room mate and felt that it was okay to lie to us for that long. I don't even know if she would have ever told me the actual situation if  I was not moving. I kept feeling disappointed about the situation as when I moved away, there were lesser communication between us and although I wanted to be there for her to support her facing a difficult time, she chose not to open up and I was also feeling lonely in a new place where I had very less social contact. As time went by, we grew more distant from each other and the only way for me to know how she was doing was to ask my other best friend as I felt that I was making more effort to stay in touch with her than she has and stopped trying. Recently when, I returned home, she tried to meet up with me and I agreed for the 3 of us to have a meal together but I felt very uncomfortable as I felt taken for granted all this while and didn't feel the bond of friendship that we used to have any more. I still think about her every now and then but I am sure she does not as to her, I am just a person whom she knows and will never be curious to know about my well being and I actually felt being used, as she might have just wanted to see me to pass some things to another mutual friend of ours living in the same location as I am now. The problem is, I don't think I can ever feel normal again and it is painful because at least for me, I thought we were close friends who would be the first point of contact when anything happens in our lives.. it also aches when we were the only friends she had while she was in a relationship with this guy that her family was against of. It does seem more difficult to break up with a friend then a lover especially when we have known each other for decades and have come to a point where I can't face her without feeling strange and upset.

I belive that happaned because people misinterpreted it. Before i copy and paste it again, i just want to clarify that i am genuinely just looking for frendships, nothing more. Alright, with that said, here we go again:\n\n\nSo i was laying down in my bed a couple of days ago, lost in my own thoughts when i sudently realised \"...Wait a second... I have no female friends!\". I am a an introvert and i find it hard to trust and get closer to people, so i only have like 2 friends IRL, and they're both guys. My last close friendship with a girl ended up a little over a year ago, because long story short she was very toxic and i don't need those kinds of people in my life. It is kinda hard to explain why, and maybe i can tell you after we talk for a little bit, but i feel like i could use some female friends right now.\n\nSo now to the part that it actually matters, my introduction: I'm a 20 years old nerdy guy from europe. I'm a college student, and even though i'm 20, i'm still a freshman. That is due to the fact that i changed my college degree this year. I used to study pure mathematics, because i really like math (i know crazy right?), but i felt like i wasn't learning anything of value that i would use in real life, cause it's all too theoretical. Don't get me wrong, you can do a lot of great things with math. Math is really important, and if you're smart enough to know how to use it, you can achieve great thing... The problem is, i'm not one of those people :/\n\nWell i'm getting of topic... so since i didn't really feel like i was studying what i wanted, i decided to change to a more practical college degree, so i choose mechanical engeneering, and i'm liking it so far.\n\nMy interests are gaming (like 90% if the guys here, big surprise right?). I game a lot, probably more than i should haha. Currently i'm only playing league of legends, since my pc is not good enough to play most of the recent tittles. I'm also into TV shows, although i might be 1 or 2 seasons behind in some of them. I like The Flash (let me rephrase that, i actually LOVE the flash), walking dead, mr robot, arrow. Some of my all time favorites are himym, breaking bad and lost (We have to go back Kate!!! WE HAVE TO GO BACK!!! God that part gave me chills). As for music i'm more into rock and metal, but i can listen to pretty much anything... Well, unless those dumb pop songs that only talk about love and sex and those dumb raps about money and hoes. I really apreciate the lyrics in a song actually, so if a song is poorly written like that, more often than not i'm gonna despise it. I also used to play the guitar when i was a kid, and very recently i started having piano classes. I absolutely suck at it, but i really enjoy it. Since i'm very nerdy and i don't do any outdoor activities, i plan to start some in the near future, like start playing a sport for example. I'm thinking about basketball or badminton, since they're both sports i really like to play.\n\nAs for my personality, there is not really much more to say, i already said that i'm nerdy and quiet, but some people like me cause they find me funny, so i guess it's a good thing to point out here? Well, it depends, sometimes i just say a lot of wierd crap and sometimes i'm just very serious. It really depends on my mood. I have to admit that lately i've been feeling really low, so it might take awhile before you see that funny part of me.\n\nOh well, i don't know if this was a good description, but it is what it is. Did you find me interested and maybe want to chat and try to be friends? Feel free to hit me up!\n\nWell, before ending there's actually one more thing that i want to ask. Try and be somewhat responsive. I know we all have our lifes and that we all have other way more import thing in our lives. I know that sometimes we're just not really in a chatting mood and just we just want to be left alone. I totally get, i am like that too. But if you message me, try not to go entire weeks without aswering. Been there and it sucks! People have done that to me and it really sucks. It's ok to not aswer some days, but a week or two can really suck.\n\nAnd i think this is all. Cheers friends :)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We have a mutual interest in fishing (not really, just easier to use fishing as an example.  Our actual mutual interest is something a bit more private).\n\nWe have talked for hours about anything and everything well beyond the scope of fishing.  This is someone I felt very close to and would do anything for.  \nLately he has been withdrawing.  At first it was just a little but now he hardly ever speaks to me.  I finally asked him what was going on and he said he had met someone new.  This new friend thinks fishing is absolutely horrible and wants nothing to do with it.  So he has stopped fishing completely so that he doesn't offend her by accident or anything.\n\nAnd since he knows how important fishing is to me, he doesn't wanna hang out with me much anymore.  I have told him that I value his friendship to the point that fishing is just an incidental part and not something we need to do or even discuss anymore.  His reply was that because of our long history of fishing together, it would be really awkward for him to hang out with me now.\n\nWhat I find myself wondering is if his new friend even realizes that he has forsook fishing and is about to ditch another friend just so he doesn't risk offending her.  Maybe she's okay with someone else fishing but she just wants no part of it herself.   Is this something I should ask her?  Maybe strike up a conversation with her and ask her what she thinks of others who fish?  If she says she's fine with that then I could tell my friend so and things could go back to normal.  But if she says she could never be friends with someone who fishes, is it fair that my friend is giving up something he enjoys just to maintain this friendship with her?\n\nOr would talking to her about this be seen as manipulative and maybe I should just let my friend go?

I am using a throwaway account because it is much easier to somehow meet people who don't have obvious ulterior motives. \n\nTo be perfectly honest, we all have ulterior motives here. Whether it's to feel morally better or emotionally better. Some people may have more orthodox or notable needs like actually wanting a friend for life. I just would like to avoid those, and yes, the big elephant in the room, men who see female and think finally an opportunity of romantic relations developing from a foundation of friendship. And it's not bad, at least I don't think, but pretty counter-productive. \n\n\nThat now being said, I am looking for platonic friendships. Low maintenance ones because I am also low maintenance. I have friends that I've known for over 5 years that I'll talk with after a few months of not talking but our relationship doesn't falter. I am relatively spontaneous and get overwhelmed easily. For the most part, I like talking about anything and all, any time. I like to say I have a lot of time, I do but even I have to take a step back and do things so that's why I am low maintenance. I want to be a buddy you call occasionally and greet - is that superficial? I don't know, I think it frees me having any sort of company about but it's only superficial when you don't care about that person.\n\n\nI have a lot of free time meaning I'll either be studying, hanging out with \"real life friends\", panicking about studying, watching youtube, eating, making my minis if I ever get round to that or simply just doing other necessities. I game when I can which is when I'm at home and I'm home this week coming and then the Easter holidays. I sound boring, don't I? I can't even watch films or listen to music with someone if I don't want my laptop to spasm whilst I'm away from home... it's really depressing and I will use that term because it really does isolate me.\n\n\nI feel so isolated when I can't do the things above, gaming - I've done that my whole life and I feel so alone without even an online community to come back to. Without it, it gives me such low moods because I like gaming for the social side like the most. And on my own, it's hell and I hate it and I am trying to be okay on my own but really? I suck at it, I'm going to therapy (which is free so it's not with a professional but a volunteer who's trained) and I suck at it - yikes, I become so restless, it takes over the mind...\n\n\n\nSo, with all that said, I'd like to just say I've been recently been feeling more empathetic and pretty stable with that. I like to think I'm tactfully honest rather than brutally honest but I am pretty passionate, in a big rant way. I like listening to people and their \"who hurt you\" type of conversation. Since I'm also dealing with some issues, I like to relate through myself throughout the conversation so please don't think I'm being self-absorbed or vain, that's the last thing I want to do. \n\nLet me be your pseudo therapist, lets talk childhood, traumas, things that upset you in highschool/work, family relations, friend relations, coping mechanisms that are unhealthy but you do it anyways because fuck it. There's a lot of discord servers who just don't allow \"those\" sort of talks without resorting to a hotline,  which I get because the policies but those \"unhealthy coping mechanisms\"  or websites that censor your poetry because it might \"trigger\" someone else. *coughs* It just makes me feel so much more isolated and frustrated and I imagine it is for other people. And even if it does seclude you to seek professional help (I know I have), it just can never feel like enough.\n\nSo, that's my offer. **I offer to be your pseudo therapist or your occasional gaming buddy**.P.S  I am scared of women but I love them so much, so please contact me. I don't know what puts me off but I think it's the envy of seeing women, being so powerful even when they think they aren't but they definitely are and I'm just like damn, I am nottttt worthy.\n\nAnyways, this has been the end of my TEDtalk.

I've known this friend for 10 years or so, mostly at a casual social level with the occasional personal conversations two women often enjoy.  She told me early on, \"I will never call you\", \" I just don't call people\".  I told myself that if I wanted to have her as a friend that was part of the deal.  It was up to me to either accept it, or let go of the friendship. to be clear, she does text sometimes but just for a specific thing like going to the movies, etc.  There are no calls just to say hi and check in with a friend. So our friendship has grown within those constraints, sometimes I wish it was more, sometimes it's ok.  The past few months, lets say since Thanksgiving, I have not heard from her.  The times I have reached out,she texts back that she's busy.  I should say that one of the reasons things have gotten so quiet between us is that I got tired of making more of an effort.  So I stepped back.  \nMy questions is, do I just walk away with no conversation?  I'm pissed!!  Even if she's done, I feel like its a cowardly way to do it.  I did a writing exercise the other day to get my thoughts out about what I would say.  That helped.  This feeling of \"they need to know how their actions have hurt me!\" is very familiar.  Something about feeling that I have been wronged really hits a nerve.

We hang out on a monthly basis. She's even come on some short vacations with my boyfriend and I to the point where neither of us, including herself, consider her a third wheel.\n\nEarlier today, I saw an old friend from high school, Amy, and did a lot of reminiscing about high school and such.\n\nWe get on the subject about an old guy friend of mine, named Mark who I used to be super close to, close to the point where we added the benefits to the friendship for about 5 years (we ended this about 3 and a half years ago). Amy used to be friends with Mark as well. As we talked about him, she told me that he and Breanna had once hooked up, as in, had sex. I was shocked to find this out and she was shocked as well that I did not know this. It wasn't so surprising though as she gave me some of the details which added up to the backstory of that day: \n\nAbout 4 years ago, me, Mark, and Breanna all went to a parade here in our city, went to the bar afterwards and got a little drunk. You know, the usual, all fun. That day though, I noticed that Mark and Breanna were flirting but it was definitely a  little *too much* flirting which did not make me happy since Mark and I were still fucking around and I obviously had feelings for him as with any friends with benefits relationship eventually. Now, I can't recall if I ever told Breanna about us but I do remember getting a little upset over their flirting and said something to her about it. She reassured me that it was only flirting and nothing would happen. I believed her.\n\nEver since I found out the truth, I'm not sure how I feel towards her. My boyfriend thinks I should be mad about it. I know if I had found out about this 4 years ago, I absolutely would have been pissed as hell! Right now I'm not and it's probably because we have such a good friendship and don't want that ruined. My trust towards her went down a little though but this will now be in the back of my mind for as long as I'll know now.\n\nI love Breanna, she's great but she's a little too desperate as a single woman so this is why this wasn't all that surprising. Mark was a man whore, pursued her, she was horny and went for him. He definitely must have told her to keep quiet about their hook up since she tells me about everything, especially her dating and sex life. She's still single now.\n\nWhat do I do? Do I confront her? Should I just keep this to myself and let it go?\n\n**TLTR;** Bestie hooked up with my friend with benefits 4 years ago. I found this out from an old friend earlier today. I feel slightly betrayed and lost some trust in her. Do I confront her or leave it alone?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

He thinks that I have wronged him, despite knowing him for less than an hour, but I feel that is very unfair, as he has never listen to my side of the argument, and I believe that he uses this as an excuse to get closer to my best friend. My best friend happens to be one of the most popular kids in school and is very charming and charismatic.\n\nThe new guy tries to punish me by separating me from my best friend. He does this by sitting between my best friend and me while in class and is always interrupting me when I am talking to my best friend. He tried to block me from my best friend in every single class, but my best friend put a stop to it. However, he still persists in trying to sit between my best friend and me. In the end, we allowed him to do it for the first class everyday for the rest of the week.\n\nWhen I refuse to tolerate his actions, he stares at me like he wants to kill me. He reads my text messages over my back, probably scared that my best friend and I are communicating with one another. He went through my test papers without my permission. He follows us everywhere, even in the toilet. He will stand right next to my best friend at the urinals. I voiced my opposition to how he treats us and he rebuffed me, saying that I am the one who is over-reacting and that his actions are perfectly normal. He even blames me and my best friend for not including him more in our lives.\n\nIt is frustrating that he is trying to negotiate the terms of our friendship, insisting that my best friend make time specifically for him without me around. As he feels, that I get to spend so much time with my best friend and it is only fair that he deserves some of that. I feel that he is emotionally blackmailing me and my best friend, that if we refuse his demands, he will continue trying to separate us.\n\nWe gave in to his demands, but his actions of trying to separate us persists. We tried confronting him and making a stand against him, but it only made things worse. He got so angry and tried to challenge us. For example, while I was walking with my best friend down the hallway chatting, he ran towards us, push me aside and squeezed right between us. He kept interrupting every single one of our conversations.\n\nHe is getting more desperate, he appears more tense and very nervous. He says that I am jealous that he is getting closer to my best friend. This couldn't be further from the truth, my best friend hates him and limits their interactions to school only. My best friend refuses to have anything to do with him outside of school. The problem here is that my best friend is so charismatic that even a casual conversation with him feels like a lifelong connection had been struck.\n\nI am really at my wits ends trying to deal with this guy. I don't know how to deal with him rationally. I hate cutting people out from my life as I feel that it is a hurtful thing to do. I want to give him a chance, but I don't know how to proceed on trying to get him to be nicer to us and treat us with mutual respect.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Dancing was fun for half an hour or so but then the urge for drunken conversation (preferably sitting down without all the flailing about of the arms and legs business) drove me to the smoking area, even though I usually do not smoke. I did what I do best in a state of alcoholized confidence and began chatting with everyone and anyone.\n\n\"So, how's it going with the girls tonight?\" Said the guy from whom I'd shamelessly bummed a cigarette. I replied that for me, clubbing is near identical to being a fish out of water. So no, I had not scored anything. Somehow his and my friends found us both simoultainiously and joined the conversation like squawking seagulls around a discarded ice cream cone. I don't remember how but the conversation migrated to that of tinder. I said that I sometimes get matches, but I have a hard time to spark a conversation, and harder still to keep them going. \n\n\"Lemme look at em',\" One of the strangers said. Being thoroughly drunk at this point, I didn't particularly care if he wrote something embarrassing. So, I played along and handed him my phone. \n\nIt is at this point that things begin to turn sour. Three messages were written; two of them lame but tame pickup lines, the third being, 'Wanna fuck?'. All of these I laughed off. It's ok if someone's offended by them, the chances I'll ever see the girl is so minimal that the chance I'll suffer any repercussions of my behaviour is near zero. \n\nThat's what I thought, until I woke up this morning (Monday). I had a new message, from Emilia. She was the one who'd received the third message! 'Oh dear' I thought and opened the app with trembling fingers. \n\"Sure thing\" She had replied . Let me tell you, I was feeling so much stuff at once: Anxiety, excitement, pride, shame, et.c. \n\nI haven't responded yet and I don't really know why. I've never had sex before and I know that she's very experienced. So I guess in some way I'm afraid of performing badly or being laughed at. I feel that this just isn't me. I would never write that, and it wasn't even me who did it. But it's not like I don't want to sleep with her, she's very beautiful. It just feels weird to sleep with someone you barely know. \nIn another way, I'm excited that someone wants to be with me (I've been really insecure about my body throughout my teens).\n\nI commend anyone that managed to read the whole thing! Even if I don't get any responses, it feels good to have lifted this off of my chest. If I'm being ridiculous, please tell me. If you have any opinions, advice, or similar experiences, please comment down below. ", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

He's extremely image conscious, has zero self awareness, and a fragile ego. We went to seperate colleges in different parts of California and every time I'd go visit him, he'd be in a stereotypical drugged out (pot and pills from what I saw), alcohol fueled \"bro\" setting. I'm not judging. Nothing wrong with that if you can control yourself and know when to grow up. I had fun visiting him, but he didn't surround himself with good people and actual friends he could count on and hasn't really maintained friendships aside from me. More on that later.\n\nOver the past few years I noticed it more. For example, we both enjoy acting but are in seperate local community groups. For a while, this worked great until his group started to become less active. Of course, he has pushed over the years for us to do something together. I know this would be a disaster. As I said before, he is image obssesed and has a fragile ego. He often puts other groups down as if everything isba competition. Every comment he makes about himself and his group has been about how incredible he and everything is, and how he should be famous, and he embelleshes everything with little lies scattered throughout every story. To be very broad, one time he talked to my group members about how he has been in all of these projects that I know didnt happen, wtf?? Why even bother making shit like that up? No one cares. I don't even think he realizes he does it. We are amateurs and its a hobby I do for fun. Itd be one thing if he took it seriously and devoted his life to it in order to make a career out of it, but thats absolutely not the case. I know being in a troupe with him would drive me crazy and take all the fun out of it. Being proud and confident is one thing, having zero humility is another. Whatever, thats just one example.\n\nA couple of years ago we started to work together and things have been getting infuriating for me. We started working together in the same office, not exactly on purpose. I thought itd be cool, but I dont particularly enjoy it. Mike is the co-worker who always talks about how vital he is to the business, but doesn't do nearly as much as he says. He got involved with a mutual co-worker. It's been going on a while now. She is younger than us and is married, and Mike and her have had their fair share of drama between them. They are on again, off again (depending on her), and he has zero self respect or self awareness. He doesn't know what a healthy relationship is. Mike will follow her around and do whatever she asks. She works in accounting, its a seperate department. Everyone will know about it, then he will either play the victim or deny anything. Of course, I feel uncomfortable because its my place of work too. I used to back up Mike at first and support him, but holy shit, do I regret that now. I finally realize he is not the victim. He allows it to happen and thrives on it. I blame him for not transferring or at least having any willpower considering how long its been and how far this has went. He thinks he loves her and It's really frustrating. He has gotten extremely depressed over this and I have told him ad nausea he has to stop and why. I'm sick of it, and I also worry about it becoming an HR nightmare (god forbid, they get me involved). Then the next point...\n\nHes a fucking alcoholic. I always suspected it was an issue, but that also exploded this past year. He was admitted to the hospital for pancreatitis. He was in there for a while and missed a lot of work. It was apparently due to a genetic issue, but I'm sure the alcohol doesn't help. He lives at home. At the hospital I spoke to his family. They told me they were close to kicking him out before he had health issues because of the drinking. We live in an expensive part of San Francisco and dont make a ton, so that is scary as fuck. San Francisco is expensive as fuck. I can only make it work with 3 other roommates (wouldnt change a thing, though! Love my city). I cannot and will not shelter him (and least not for more than a short amount of time) if that happened, as I have my own life and problems to worry about and I don't own my own place. No idea what he would do in that case. His parents care about him, but apparently didnt know what to do and it sounds like some sort of ultimatum was given.\n\nHis health problems didnt change anything. He wanted to drink once after and I flat out told him not to in front of me. We had quite a talk about it. He tries to hide it. I've seen liquor bottles he brings over and tries to hide. I've seen him order drinks when he thinks I don't see. I dont know what to do. Ive stopped saying anything. He drives me nuts, now, and Ive been limiting my one on one time with him. He doesn't really have any other close friends, and I feel extreme guilt over that. As I said, I have a plethora of personal problems to worry about, so I am a busy guy and have to also worry about taking care of me. That doesnt mean I dont worry or care, but its hard for me to be around him sometimes.\n\nI feel like I am at a total loss. He lies about still talking to that girl outside of work, he lies about drinking, he hasnt changed. I know I've only highlighted the negative things about him but hes a good guy. I recognize that the bragging and self victimizing comes from low self esteem.That makes me feel terrible. He's very loyal, and we have known each other a long time now. He claims he is in therapy now, but who knows. He's secretive about everything. I'm just sick of him always victimizing himself, and after his health issues, I worry his life choices may lead to something irreversible.\n\nDo I confront him for the 100th time to no avail? Do I tell his parents and risk our friendship or their reaction? Do I do nothing? Help.\n\nTLDR- Friend is an alcoholic who might be riding on the wrong train\n\n", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I am in a serious committed relationship and I'm happy with who I'm with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand to sum it up, my personality goes as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn real life I'm quiet, reserved and I do more observing than talking. I only speak when spoken to or if I have something I need to add into a discussion/debate. you'll rarely find me participating in a discussion, but a debate you'll find me participating in. I'm a live and let live person, I am not religious, I am not on the left or the right, I have no extreme beliefs and views-- I'm a firm believer of letting other's live how they want to live and respecting their choice to do so, so long as their choices do not limit the freedom and safety of others. I am LGBT+ friendly. I don't understand everything but I am queer myself and I support those within the community. I am introverted and generally avoid large gatherings, if I do attend a gathering, I tend to stick to a close friend or stay to the side. My desire for avoiding social interaction has nothing to do with shyness or anxiety but I've been like this for as long as I could remember and I've accepted that I'm biologically wired to be introverted.  Once breaking through my reserved layer, you'll discover that I have the personality of a crackhead, am bubbly and very playful. I may come off as cold and emotionless from the surface but once spoken to, you'll discover that I am in fact, extremely sensitive, empathetic and kind hearted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnline I would say the same thing applies but the only difference is you wouldn't be able to see my lurking around and observing in person, I'm also good at hiding the fact that I'm reserved through text so it seems like you've jumped right into the chatty and engaged layer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not a consistent texter as I have school, a job, a relationship and a family to tend to, but I do try my best to text throughout the day. This does not guarantee that I will text you every day all day, I still like my space from even digital social interaction so I would appreciate a friend whose okay with some banter every now and then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI give good advice and I'm a great listener.\n\nI'm quick to annoy, but extremely slow to anger. \n\nand I'm good at keeping secrets because.... I mean, who am I gonna tell?\n\nand I wouldn't mind having friends of any gender or age group, just don't be too clingy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInbox me and let's see what we can cook up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Now we\u2019ve been making the characters as I\u2019ve been building the homebrewed world and even though I want to be serious and have some fun, they decide to make characters that want to be insubordinate and have a chance to kill innocents if they get the chance with the belief that \u201cI follow the god of Death, so if he says so, then he comes first\u201d and when I say that they\u2019ll be consequences and quote tips I heard from Matthew Mercer on YouTube, they scoff it off and tell me I\u2019m not going to railroad them. \n\nIt really feels like they don\u2019t actually appreciate them, but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t talk to them about it because they\u2019d get upset.

I'm glad I found this subreddit, I don't usually use Reddit, yet I made an account for this. I was debating all day on if I should post here, just some pointless worries and fears, but I decided to create this, to maybe see what happens. \n\nIn all honesty, I feel like I am on a verge of a downward spiral into bad emotions.

I understand that people can drift away, life happens, it's happened before, yet it still pulls at my heart. \n\nI'm not looking for replacements of course! But still, trying to meet new people is a healthy thing to do, and I am in need of more healthy actions in my life really. \n\nNow a bit more about me, I am currently going to community college, waiting to hear back from some college applications to see if I can transfer. I am the President of the writing club at my community college, and I run a DnD campaign for some kids at my local game store that I work out. \n\nI live on the east coast, and well, another important thing is that I have some bad anxiety problems. It has been getting better for the most part, but still can just rear it's ugly head a lot. \n\nNow my interests are mainly into writing, reading, and music. I usually write short fiction, with some bits of poetry here and there. I love reading all kinds of books, but fantasy is a common thing in my list of favorites. My music playlist is one of my joys. Over 650 songs and still growing, all kinds of different genres and random songs on there that I enjoy wholeheartedly. \n\nOn the nerdier side of things, I really enjoy Magic the Gathering as well as Dungeons and Dragons. \n\nI don't really know what else to say. I just really need a friend. Someone to talk to and enjoy the company of. I'll do my best to create conversation, although I'm not quite the best at it.

(Putting this in so you\u2019ll know he too is an minority.)\n \nI hate the thought of being a loner. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it, but I just don\u2019t want fo be by myself. I have this friend. My main friend. We\u2019ve been friends since the beginning of freshman year of college. I go to a small college, so everyone knows everyone. But since we\u2019ve been friends we\u2019ve had many falling outs. 1-was for saying the n word all the time. I came to this college, and everyone and they mamas kept saying the n word which makes me very uncomfortable. Til this day I hear it from non black people and cringe.  (by the way im Africans American) i have never heard it in hs from anybody but black people. and never experienced this i confronted him about it and was told i was weird. After that, i forgave him and stopped being \u2018uptight\u2019. He would say- no other black person gets uncomfortable or mad but you\u2019. I never experienced this and just thought I was in the wrong. After this I\u2019ve noticed he would say it repeatedly just to taunt me. Sadly, we became closer. I opened up about my depression, my family and my weight. And he was there when no one else was. But i made a mistake. Last year March, I bought him concert tickets for the both of us $350. And because I made this big purchase to his idol, I feel like thats why he\u2019s still in the friendship. After that, when school resumed, when we would hang out with our other friends he would make comments about my weight and make black stereotypes \u2018jokes\u2019. I remember walking in his room with a black scarf(kind of like a durag for women) for him to say \u2018let me hide my things, before you steal them\u2019. He would always make snide comments towards me. And its so weird that I don\u2019t say anything anymore . Usually I would tell him straight up but he wouldn\u2019t listen or pretend like he\u2019s listening. Lastly there was a convo where my hair was brought up. My friend said \u2018wow i love your hair, I wish I had thick hair\u2019 and he said \u2018what, nigger hair?\u2019 And I froze, because it was so unexpected. This never happened to me.  i felt so hot. I yelled at him, and his response was \u2018oh this again\u2019-meaning I was too sensitive. And I dropped him. For only a couple of weeks. Till i of course talked to him again. I try to educate him on his ignorance each time but I feel like he looks down on me. He talks about/down on everyone (our friends) to me, so I highly doubt that he doesn\u2019t talk about me. I feel so stupid for letting this friendship continue. \nSo now, we just started working ,at the same place, most likely getting the same hours. And its more comments that make me so mad. He comments on everything I do, how better he is at everything I try to do. Provoking me and taunting me. I\u2019m scared being alone again with my thoughts will get me to that depressed state of mind. But Enough is honestly enough. And I know I\u2019m 10x mentally better than I have been for years. I dislike this friendship and I have been feeling this way for a long time. And always thought \u2018this is temporary\u2019 since I\u2019ll be switching schools soon. But I hate this. Its my second year of college and I have to stay another semester in this school before I transfer, with people who I truly don\u2019t like. I know what I stand for and I know what I want! So I don\u2019t understand why I am doing this to myself. Do I be a loner or fake all these friendship? I know the answer already but I would like others inputs.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

One of them i know her for 3 years and another friend i know him for an year.  We talk at group chat room apps,  last week when we were at a chat room, some other girl was at that room, and she started liking my post and started saying stuffs like by observing me she thinks I am a good person and wants to be my friend and started complementing for my thoughts i shared in my chats and my posts she liked. She ignored both my friends my 3 year old friend felt rude and also felt suspicious like this new girl is strange because she is way too friendly and too good to me to be real. I felt a bit strange too. That new girl visited our room again. Only talking to me nicely,  ignoring my friends and also being rude and cursing the strangers who were randomly visiting our room. She said \"i feel a connection between us, she doesn't feel that way for others that is why she only talks to me\"...  And she started getting super clingy towards me. My both friend asked me to beaware because she is new and insisting so much to get close that is not normal but creepy. And she always leaves just after i leave the room. So my 1 year old friend kiddingly teased her \"are you a lesbian always clinging around her like a possessive gf\" She ignored him but she inboxed me private saying \"she felt rude when he called her a lesbian\" i said \"he was just kiddng\". Then next day he teased her again. And this time she left the room but she came back later when he was not at room and started cursing him and warned me that \"he is not a good person I will get hurt if I will stay with him\"... But i blocked her instead. My this friend was intentionally teasing her, testing her, he is really protective towards his friends, I know his trait, he is right most of the time and we are from same cities and he had helped me in my difficult time, so that is why i have faith on him. Although calling her a lesbian was a bit mean I agree. Even after I blocked her rmy friend says she keeps messaging me in chat room saying she cares about me and she is never wrong about people and to stay away from him. I just felt I can't trust her she know that how much he means to me but she overreacted by vertually abusing him just because of a silly joke. This whole situation is ridiculous. I have just one conclusion that she is just a fake trying to get close to me to for some ulterior motives that god knows because i don't care. I just go there to meet my friends not for a drama... Am i or my friends are overthinking about her? But that is true she was too clingy only towards me. I know i must not take online things way too serious.

We immediatelly hit off, and became friends. However, with time, i began feeling in love with her in a non-platonic way. I knew, even before i confessed to her what i felt, that she only saw me as a friend. Despite that, i did confess my feelings face to face with her, because, i felt i was not being honest hiding that from her.\n\nShe friendzoned me on the spot, saying that she likes me a lot, but as a sister loves her older brother. I took it like a grown up person, and told her that i respected her wishes. She said that she did not want this to affect our friendship, and i said that i would try my best for that not to happen, but that i would not make any promises. This happened close to the end of the second semester of the first year of the degree (Late April 2018).\n\nIn the first weeks after that happened, we were distant, i was still healing, and she was respecting it as i asked her to do. Eventually, i met other girls, and after a couple of months, i did begin dating someone else. In the same time period, our friendship was also repaired and we were close as before, possibly even more, because the amount of things we could trust each other with, was increasing.\n\nEventually, my relationship turned into a disaster. Broken promises by the person i was dating, lies, etc. My best friend, became my emotional support, she was always there for me, to hear me out. She\u00b4s one of the main reasons, i could find the strenght to leave that toxic relationship, which i did, in January 2019.\n\nThe first weeks after i finished that relationship were quite hard, mainly because my ex still tried to get me back and insisted on contacting me. Still, gradually, i completely stopped caring about it because life is just too short to give time to toxic people.\n\nSince late February/March, i have been feeling something different regarding my best friend. She\u00b4s very touchy with me (she has always been a bit, but it\u00b4s different this time, she lays her head on my shoulder for example and i could swear, even a common friend spotted it, she tried to hold my hand in a particular situation last week).\n\nAlso, she has a tendency of saying \"Love You\" to many persons. She does that to her sister and her brother, to her close friends, no matter genders. I think it\u00b4s some cultural thing, people here don\u00b4t have that habit (she\u00b4s from another country). I never noticed her doing that with me, before the last month or so. Last time she said it to me, i actually told \"Love you too\" and she replied \"I love you more\" and off we went, each to their places. It just felt weird, like she\u00b4s not telling everything. Something about this last statement left me thinking, specially when i add up how she\u00b4s being with me this past month This started, mainly, after we went out alone two times in this time period but under no situations were it dates, it was normal friend activities. She did say she loved both, but never read much into it.\n\nMaybe i\u00b4m seeing things, when no things are there to be seen. I don\u00b4t know, she just feels different with me, and i have no idea how to feel about it. I just feel, that if she\u00b4s feeling different about me, she should talk with me about it, just like i did last year.\n\nTLDR: Fell in love with my University best friend. Was rejected, dated someone else after it. Relationship is over and now i feel my best friend might be into me after previously rejecting me.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

To be honest... my life has become critically uh strange and by that I mean after the loss of my dad and many friends (9 in 3 years), I relapsed, I quit school, I lost interest in everything I once loved (basketball, gaming, skateboarding, guitar/bass/drums, etc) and found myself feeling like the only self-aware individual in a world full of frauds. \n\nI have never really fit in so-to-speak.

In doing so, I discovered myself and reached what one might call an \u201cawakening\u201d but the funny thing was following this wonderful and enthralling experience..... I felt even less connected with those around me than before? It was like I found something, something that was quite literally EVERYTHING and I wanted to share it with my so-called-friends but they only cast judgements and told me I was \u201cmaniac\u201d or \u201cinsane\u201d which caused me to alienate myself even more because what\u2019s the point? \n\n\nI could go on and on discussing that ordeal in depth etc but the point is this: I\u2019m looking to connect on a spiritual level with others and grow in this journey not be halted by those lacking understanding and those only interested in the physical world and not the vastly more important and less discussed metaphysical realm. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to talk and perhaps drop down the rabbit hole a bit further, feel free to message me. \n\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We're both brain over heart people in secure relationships who are somewhat anxious. As transplants to the city where we live, neither of us has many friends, even though we've been here for a while.

But where I live is very religious and family oriented, so it's been tough to find people close to me with similar interests.\n\nSo a little bit about me, I'm a homebody, so most things I do at home.

Any opinions regarding this would be highly appreciated. I am a senior in high school. My school has been planning a senior trip to a major city since the beginning of the school year. I always wanted to go ever since I caught wind of it, and began saving money so that I could handle the necessary expenses. My \u201cbest\u201d friend, however, mistakenly told me that her graduation would be during the time that the trip was to take place, so I purposely skipped it in order to attend her graduation. Rather conveniently after the supposed sign up deadline for the trip, my \u201cbest\u201d friend mentioned that she was incorrect about her graduation date and that it would be at a later time after the field trip. Whether she was genuinely mistaken or she was simply trying to get me out of the field trip because she didn\u2019t want to be the only one that could not join/she claims she can\u2019t afford it, I don\u2019t know. I do know that she has sneaky tendencies. We had talked about spending spring break with each other while the rest of our graduating class went on the field trip, until she and I had a falling out.\nRecently, my \u201cbest\u201d friend and I had a falling out and it really betrayed my trust in her. We were not on speaking terms for a solid week and a half, because she claimed she \u201cneeded a break since she was angry at me,\u201d even though I technically did nothing wrong to her (situation is in a previous post of mine for clarity). During that time, I spoke to the coordinator of the field trip and asked if I could somehow get on board to go on the field trip with the rest of my graduating class. I just needed (and still need) to get away. The final answer was a yes, so I will be going. My \u201cbest\u201d friend had asked the field trip coordinator if she could sign on much later than I did, and as a result she cannot go. I luckily got the last spot available since I asked first. I told my \u201cbest\u201d friend about me going on the trip more than likely, and she seemed fine with it initially, albeit perhaps slightly disappointed. Then, she made a message in a group chat we are in about being able to spend the entire spring break with me, even though I already told her I was going on the field trip most likely. She tends to be extremely clingy and emotionally draining, and a major reason I am going on this field trip is to have a slight break from her. I have been trying to put some distance between us for a while. She exhausts me. My question is: Am I a bad friend for going on the field trip without her? And how should I react if she tries to guilt trip me into staying? Thank you for reading. ", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

At times she would bring up situations in my life that make me vulnerable and ask questions about it. For example \u201cdo you even like your boyfriend?\u201d Or about a parent I\u2019m estranged from \u201cDo you get sad when you see me and my parent get along?\u201d. From my opinion and a couple friends\u2019 opinions, those aren\u2019t cool questions to ask. It just put me down! She also once asked me if i even have any friends besides her. It made me feel that maybe our friendship caused me to distance myself from my other friends. The event that kinda caused me to reconsider our friendship was a trip. She said \u201clet\u2019s go to this place together with this club i am in\u201d (of course for privacy im just saying general words). I said that i might have my boyfriend over then she gets kinda mad like \u201cYou always see him, please please come with me!\u201d And so i switched when i would see my boyfriend. My boyfriend and I live in different cities and since im in school and he graduated, i just get to see him every couple weekends. The night before the trip i barely got sleep because she spent a lot of the time after 1am arguing with another friend on the phone. On the day of the trip she gravitated more towards two other friends that were in the club. So i wondered why she almost begged me to go if I wasn\u2019t that important that day? So after a week of sitting on my feeling I decided the friendship is over. I know it\u2019s a bit drastic, but in general my confidence is always low when i am around her and it could be me but she doesn\u2019t help. The factor that causes me to waver is her mental health. She has gone to the doctor\u2019s to see if she is having any mental health issues because she has been struggling for some time. She told me that she\u2019s gotten a lot worse sonce we last talked so she has been acting mean towards people. When I\u2019m around, she is very nice and friendly with other people so I couldn\u2019t tell if she was truthful.

I've realised that she has become more outgoing compared to when we first met, but she interrupts other people's conversations to talk about herself and constantly puts down other people.\n\nWhenever she talks with the \"transfer student\" in our school (who I am friends with), she always feels the need to emphasise her 'superiority' for having been in our school since the beginning of high school. Then, she talks in a passive aggressive way which I have never seen her do (\"You can't do that subject for university exams, our school is too smart for that. Maybe in your old school you could have done it.\"). It's really annoying because my friend is already having trouble adjusting to the increased workload as well as her electives which she has never done before, and my supposedly \"best friend\" is treating her badly simply because she transferred here. I'm pretty much stuck in the middle because I want to stand up for my friend but I don't want to jeopardise my relationship with the other person.\n\nBut it's not just other people. When I don't get a certain concept in class, it's \"How don't you get this in x subject? You're in the top class for y subject!\" because that totally helps. She never does her homework for electives and justifies it by saying \"The teachers are more harsh on you anyways, they don't like you.\" Anything and everything I do is scrutinized by her. I can even spell a word incorrectly or mispronounce something and she'll ask me if I'm dumb.

I think every one agreed I was an Ass, but then it was when I started to think of the other things that was in there but we had only really been talking about then not really being clean and feeling like the sneaky whispering and not sharing made for not a fun break. \n\nMy friend took a bath once and on the Wednesday and her boyfriend once Thursday, They smelled bad. They don\u2019t look very clean and tidy and over the years I think it has gotten worse. There were other things that I thought was strange and  My husband thought it was gross. Then commented on them bringing snacks to keep in their room and not share? Like going into their room of a night and coming out with bags of sweets, crisps and all kind and not sharing. Sitting together and eating. \n\nEverything we brought the shared shopping (proper food we split) and snacks, beers, drinks and a cake that we had brought were just put in the kitchen, offered and shared same with the beers. I know I don\u2019t have it in me to upset her be saying anything but husband feels like he doesn\u2019t really want to go away with them again. They whispered between themselves and generally they just are not happy people. \n\nThey spent most of their time on i pads and laptops, basically just not wanting to do anything. We were eating one night and they made a big deal over how lucky I was that I am comfortable with other people. Because I suggested calling the food through and it became all about how they can't even ask people for things in shops. The phone call was just to much. Then all about how she hates coming out with my and the girls and I can probably see how awful she finds it but feels like to see us she has too. \n\nThere's just a lot of things and thinking about it they went from being fun to now always being doom and gloom. I feel like I have to filter myself as you can see that everything I do say sees to some how be wrong, or I get your lucky you have this, do this, feel this.... I did say don't force yourself to do things you don't enjoy. All I got was well I dont want to be left out. \n\nEverything has become hard work, I know I was probably very judgey about the showering but its like they need a shake. Get up get dressed feel clean tidy make an effort and it'll rub off. She hates her job, house life.. her hair and it has become draining. But then she'll say but your my only friend your lucky to have so many friends, your lucky your husband wants to go out.. \n\nNot sure what I am looking for but after 30 years I am feeling drained\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I just am the kind of person who gets along great with most people, but making the next level connection that you have with a best friend is really hard for me. Last year, I met a woman that i connected with like that. She and i hung out and just talked for ages, and got to be really close over a few months. I have never had a friend this close to me. She even gets along amazingly with my fianc\u00e9, which is so lucky because we can all hang out and theres not awkwardness. We expanded our circle a little and grew to a group of five core friends, including a guy that became another best friend for me. A few months ago, she (R) and he (E) started a relationship with each other, and since then everything has changed. I am glad that they found someone that makes them happy, but its hard when your two best friends start dating each other. I see much less of them since the relationship started, and have been feeling left out a lot. The biggest thing, however, is that both of their mental healths have suffered greatly since they got together. E decided to stop taking his medication for bipolar disorder jn order to \"feel his emotions better\", and went off the deep end. R has been spending all of her time alone with him because he no longer can handle being around people but needs her around constantly. R has also been cancelling plans with me frequently to either take care of E or because she \"cant handle\" hanging out. Its gotten to the point where i hardly see them even though R and I live together, and it sucks. I want to be their to help them through the rough stuff but they only talk to each other and wont let me help. Its gotten to the point where R has started to disregard me entirely, waiting to cancel plans until far after we were supposed to meet up and wasting a lot of my time, or forgetting that we made plans and going off with E. Im constantly left in the dust with a promise from R to be back in 15 minutes only to see her the next day. I got engaged while this was going on, and I havent even gotten to celebrate with my friends because theyve been completely wrapped up in their own shit. It sucks and it makes me feel like trash. I dont know what to do. On one hand, I know that i would be happier with friends who had their shit more together, and i know that they are seeping away my energy. On the other hand, i still love them and i dont want to abandon them when they are obviously going through some shit.

I dont have a job (mainly due to the fact that we've been renovating) or any other social hobbies, therefore my small group of friends are ones I met in high school.\n\nSince I never had to move schools, most of my friends have been friends of friends. Eventually something will happen with the original friend, say they moved away or we naturally drifted apart (still got some cool buddies but not in the core group) which meant I became closer with someone else and so on. That's how I made the friends I have as of right now.\n\nI'm worried that once I move I'm going to struggle to meet anyone new.\n\nIt is already hard to hang out with my current friends due to their busy lives and work despite many of them living in the next town over. We send memes in the group chat and play games over discord, but aside from our monthly or so hang outs I don't interact with them as much as I used to.\n\nI know they'll still be my pals once I move, but honestly I can already tell some might not put in the effort to visit (I'm already planning to continue coming down for out monthly gaths) simply because it's hard enough to catch up already.\n\nI know that the first thing I will do when I move there is get a job. I am hoping this will he my solution go meeting people. But I fear it might not, or they may be fine whilst at work but not want to hang out later.\n\nI've read the advice saying to do more hobbies or go out etc, which I still plan on trying, but this town lacks a lot of what I find interesting l, and honestly there's a whole lot of older people than anything else.\n\nSo, I know this is probably an unusual post for this sub, and sorry for going on about my life story but does anyone have any other suggestions for meeting new people when you move?\n\n", "subreddit": "friendship"}

We met in class and instantly became very close, and for a while she was my only friend at school. We saw each other nearly every day, whether we were hanging out or just in class together, and we even scheduled our next semester so that we would have at least one class together every day (she's now graduated). She doesn't drive, so I gave her rides to the store and to get food all the time; I was happ to do so and she was more than thankful enough, but I think she got used to the codependency. Through J, I met \"T\" (24M), another student in my major who I also clicked with pretty instantly, and now consider one of my best friends as well. We became a little squad; we have a number of shows we watch together every week, have a group chat, and just generally hang out and talk with each other a lot.\n\nOver the past several months, my friendship with J has become strained. It started last summer when I made another close friend in class, and J became jealous of the time I was spending with them and made it clear that she hated them. To be fair, there a couple times when I chose to hang out with my new friend instead of J and T, but I was excited to be making a friend at school besides the only two I had, who had both graduated. I felt like I had to hide my friendships with others because J was so emotionally distressed by them.\n\nOver the past several months, her clinginess has become increasingly draining for me. I'm replying less to texts, hanging out less, and just generally pulling away both because of the specific nature of our friendship but also because of my own struggles with the stress of school and mental health. At the same time, she has become even more anxious in our friendship, asking me to hang out more, asking me to ask her to hang out more, asking me to compliment her more, and even telling me that she is always in the mood to hang out with me, when I definitely don't feel the same way. She has expressed to me that she has always hated hanging out in a group with me and T, and that she becomes uncomfortable and feels left out with how well we get along and talk with each other, and now has asked for an indefinite hiatus on us hanging out as a group ever, even though we're in the middle of watching shows currently airing, and lesser frequent group hangouts allow me to see my friends regularly without overwhelming me socially or negatively affecting my mental health. She only wants to hang out with me one-on-one, she wants to hang out multiple times a week, she wants me to invite her half the time, and she wants me to hang out with her more than T (did I mention they're roommates??).\n\nI want to salvage our friendship, but I feel like a caged bird. She can't stand to see me with other friends, but can hang out in group settings with anyone else. The more I pull away, the more she clings on, which makes me want to pull away even more. We had a talk about it, but I was afraid to be too direct or truthful because she's incredibly sensitive and takes what I say extremely seriously and extremely personally. I've agreed to stop hanging out in groups with her, but the stress of the situation has made me not want to socialize with anyone at all. I feel like an asshole for ignoring both her and T's texts for a week, but the thought of having to hang out with her makes me feel dread. I've been a bad friend but I also can't seem to muster the energy that she wants me to put into the relationship. I don't want to dislike her, and I want to be friends.

So...\n\nI (22M) was stupid and I almost attempted suicide. As in I locked myself in the bathroom and nearly drank bleach. My life has been in the gutter recently, between Financial struggles and being disowned by both of my parents, it's just been really rough. But I stopped myself because I could hear my son on the other side of the door. It brought me back to back to reality, but not before I inhaled smell of the bleach, which caused me to start choking.\n\nMy roommate (23F) heard me choking and got understandably distressed, unlock the bathroom door and saw the open container of bleach. She then proceeded to knock me to the ground, punch me and hit me repeatedly until my nose was bleeding and my job was swollen. The whole time she was screaming at me saying \"I can't believe you would do this to me\" \"leave me here with your kid\" \"what the hell is wrong with you\", and other things of that nature. I begged her to stop, and she did not at first. \nAt some point, I saw some sense come back to her and she tried immediately to apologize, but I was so shaken up, I backed away from her and told her to go away. At this point, my son is freaking out and then she starts to as well. I picked up my son, brought him into my bedroom and consoled him while she proceeded to freak out, stomping around the house saying she was going to call the cops.\n\nWhen I finally got both my son and her to calm down, I explained that I never drank the bleach. The entire time, she assumed that I had. When she learned I hadn't, she started crying, expressing real, genuine sorrow for what she had done.\n\nThis all happened a few hours before the time of posting this, and at this point, the situation has calmed down, though despite an obvious tension. We both apologized to each other over text after physically separating, and I promised not to scare her in such a way again. Just as she promised not to hurt me in such a way again.\n\nHere's my problem. I understand her anger, honestly I probably would have been just as distraught if she had done the same thing. We are best friends, and we have been for 12 years at this point. Really, we're like siblings. The issue that I have, is that her initial reaction to finding out I might be dying was to beat the shit out of me. Had those been my actual last moments, they would have been spent lying on the ground while my best friend beat me up asking what is wrong with me. This is a thought that I can not shake. I'm positive, had anyone else who cares about me found me in such a state, or really anyone at all, they would have called the cops first. They would not have punched me. They would have been angry, sure, but they certainly would not have punched me.\n\nNow I won't deny that I have hit her before. Like I said, we're like siblings, though I know that doesn't justify it... but I have never, ever, taken a face shot before. Especially not over and over until she was bleeding. \n\nRight now, I'm at a loss for what to do. I feel that this has only become a problem recently within our friendship, the fighting, because we are always around each other now. But unfortunately, we cannot split the household. Neither of us are financially stable enough to support ourselves, we have any outside support except for each other. Also, I don't really know how to emotionally get over this event. I don't know how to process it. Right now, I'm at work, near hours after it happened and I just don't know what to do.

I've been looking for people who appeal to me specifically in terms of hobbies, age (not too important but there's a specific age gap I'm comfortable with), and general personality. I personally don't set expectations for people, but it is still disappointing that out of all the people I messaged, the most I get in return is 2 messages from the same person and I'm doubting I will get more than that. I'm not mad as I didn't take offense to it at a personal level, but some here might. So please be careful if you post here claiming that you are looking for friendship and end up not replying to the people legitimately looking for new friends. Maybe I'll have better luck posting myself, as I guarantee I will reply to anyone interested.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, about me. I'm a 19 year old male living in the U.S. I love playing video games, watching YouTube videos, and occasionally watching anime when I can find a good series. Currently studying Computer Science at a university but I will soon be switching to Finance and will study abroad in Japan and Germany. I'm a pretty serious person, but that doesn't mean I have no sense of humor. I just tend to filter myself quite a bit until I get more comfortable around another person, though many people might find that off-putting in the beginning. I can't do much about that, I'm not going to put up a fake persona to get people to like me. We either click with how I am now, or we don't and move on. No big deal, no hard feelings. I prefer to message first as I'm not good at coming up with conversation on the spot, though voice chat is not out of the picture later on. I'm typically on here or Discord so either of those are my preferred platforms for messaging. As for the mentioned age gap, I'd prefer people within 4 years of myself (15-23), though if we have enough in common the age gap is irrelevant to me. Just seems to be the crowd easiest to converse with personally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to not sound like a hypocrite, I'll give a little warning. In a few hours I'll be out probably for the rest of the day. If you don't get an immediate message, don't think it's me ignoring it. I'd love to hear from anyone at this point. Just don't be surprised if you don't hear from me until much later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's it from me! Hope to see your messages!

As many of you have noticed, it is very hard to get responses out of people here. Let me help you as much as i can without offending anyone. (I have read the posting rules)\n\nFirst people that i recommend you don't message are people with long scripts of rants about how hard it is to get responses on this subreddit. From my personal experience, they themselves are the people who either get bored easily and/or don't respond. It is reasonable to wait a half a day for a response but when i am continually sending messages and i get measiy replies like 'i'm good, wbu' i just feel like these people have no reason to go on any typing crusades or to be worth any of my time investment.\n\nSecond type of people i do not recommend of messaging are people who refuse to send pictures of themselves and do voice/video chat. I do understand that Internet is a dangerous place and you shouldn't trust anyone there and for that exact same reason i feel like i have to validate with whom i am chatting with. Simply chatting is okay for a week or so, but if they refuse to send a selfie or answer a call past some reasonable know-each-other time they are most likely a catfish. I do understand there are shy people and people with low self esteem and social anxiety. I am however, all of the above and i still try and send pictures of myself. So if people are just typos, that is okay, but be very careful. Especially women on this sub, we know some thirsty m*****s are lurking.\n\nThen there is third type of people, the ones in the comments. Almost 99% of my friendships are me reacting to someone's comment on a post. And then they message me or me them and we like, stick together for two years or more hahahah. It is funny and i don't know why it works.\nBest. Type. Of people.\nPeriod.\n\nNow that i have added myself to my rant statistics i would love to say something about myself.\n\nMy name is Tom and i am 28 years old. I am single, living alone in a flat with my cat. He is a real sweetheart, an adopted 2yo stray. So if you don't like animals i am probably not your type of guy.\nI am a Slav, which means i love alcohol and i can drink enough of it to wipe out half of civilization. And still wake up without hangover. I also love babushka and squatting at street corners.\nI work and i am not allowed to have my phone with me at work. So i cannot reply to your messages while i am working. I also operate in weekly shifts. We can arrange a talking time if you want.\nI love to cook. I live in an area with a lot of culinary diversity so i am always trying out new stuff. My mood varies between very outdoorsy where i go crawling in the woods for herbs and mushrooms (also to wrestle with russian bears) or to dive with my trident in the summer in search of fish and octopusses (i have a small boat too and i fish from time to time) and sometimes i can be very indoorsy and just eat chips in my bed with the cat laying beside me as i binge Youtube or Reddit or play Clash of Clans.\nI am not a gamer but i do know my stuff. New Devil May Cry is amazing and i loved the Resident Evil 2 remake. X gon' give it to ya. Shame about Uberhaxornova leaving CowChop but oh well. Life goes on.\nI love improving myself in every way possible, always learning new stuff. I read, i paint sometimes and i write from time to time. I know how to do every home chore. I recently learned sewing and a bit of woodwork (no, not THAT woodwork. Pervs.)\nI live in a beautiful country and i love to share pictures of it and exchanging info about various social events and culture. If you don't like it just say so and i won't bother you with it.\nI volunteer at the public kitchen where i bring a lot of supplies or cooked food from time to time. I also love volunteering in an animal shelter, but it is heartbreaking.\nI am generally a soft spoken individual but i can be brutally honest a lot (no sugarcoating here) and i can be a perv from time to time, but i am single so please bear with my frustrations.\n\nIn order to chat with me you should be a quick responder or at least try, to know English well and to not be afraid of typing! The more you give, the more i can give back! So please, no one liners and short responses. It kills the mood. I am in CET time zone so if you are close by that would be a blast. I will talk to anyone of all ages, sex, nationality and color. I do love talking to middle aged people recently. They respond and and very pleasant to talk to.\n\nI have a plethora of chat apps. Discord is increasingly popular, but i do have Snap, Kik and Viber.\nMessage me if you are interested or just comment down below.\n\nThanks for reading and have a great day!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Apart from depression, anxiety, bipolar/borderline personality disorder, anorexia and a recently transmitted sexual disease (guess which one) I'm a good person, or so I like to believe. I'm ftmtf long story short, I'm originally female after a ton of bullying and convincing I decided I'm a male, then when I found out I wouldn't be able to have kids of my own I then decided to reverse into my original state, only to find out by my gynecologist... My eggs are fried, I have PCOS which causes alot of issues for me and it just adds to my list of problems. \nIronically my favorite food is eggs, the multitude of various different ways to prepare them is astounding. I used to enjoy long walks on the beach until I broke my ankle, I was recently able to get crutches, but hopping around and getting them stuck in the sand really sucks, I ended up losing one of them at the beach. Now-a-days I stay at home and question my sexuality, sometimes I wish I was just born a duck.. they have it so easy, thoes cute creatures just waddle, swim and eat fish. I love summer weather, so migrating would be exciting I can just imagine shaking my tail in excitement, but alas I have no tail and if I'm being honest my bottom is kinda droopy. Aside from that I do have interests, one being music, I enjoy all types, my fave being thoes of the melancholy genre, but I do listen to the popular stuff sometimes, and it just makes me sad. The other day I heard this new rap song by the rapper blueface? And I was just filled with sadness, due to my lack of tail I am currently unable to \"bust down thotiana\". I cried over this for 15 minutes, tbh I feel better. Making friends is extremely hard for me due to the fact that I haven't had a real one since grade 2... I still wonder how Steve is from time to time, he's probably living the life. There were 2 good things about Steve, he loved carrots and he smelled, but it was a nice smell something that makes you feel safe even reminds you of home kinda like potatoes... I really do miss him, the friendship kind of ended in a mild tragedy depending on how you look at it. There were two mean girls in the class, Sarah and Ashley. I didn't like them, but a chance arose to actually become their friends and they were quite popular. So as a child, that wanted to be liked I agreed to follow their plan. They thought it would be fun to take Steve outside and told me to get him, so I did. We went outside unknowing to the teacher and when we got out, Steve took off like a bullet he was gone within a blink of an eye, we could not catch him and he headed straight for the forest I'm guessing to be with his real friends, Steve was the class rabbit. It was a really sad day for me, not only did I lose my best friend, but the girls said it was my idea and that I threatened to beat them up... These girls were bigger than me and I was very malnourished (came from a poor family) not only did I get in trouble, but my mom had to pay the school for a \"new\" Steve. When I got home it was just further torment. All I want is a break and more importantly a friend, a real friend that talks to me, with words! And won't be mean to me, hopefully likes eggs... Even if you don't like eggs I really would like a friend!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Loved each other very much. Life got in the way. Both of us got busy. Talked much less. I tried to end it because I felt neglected. She promised to change. I flirted with a girl over text at my work.

I just feel so broken that I caused all the pain and now I'm living a nightmare. I keep imagining her with another guy and it brings me to tears every single time. I want her to be happy, but I want her to be happy with my again. I don't know how I'll go on and quite frankly I don't really want to anymore. People will say I'm young, but that's not a reason. I'm just tired of me picking myself up over and over again just to be kicked in the face again. I'm not suicidal but I really don't want to be here anymore. I've lost almost all of my friends I can confide in and I'm literally left in the dust alone.

I didn't learn my lesson until now.)\n\n\\- Having to study and write my LSAT in two months.\n\n\\- Hiding from my family which still thinks I'm in school.\n\n\\- Paying for all the rent alone.\n\n\\- Having nobody to talk to. (Don't say therapist please I've tried and I don't have that kind of money now)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really wish she would be here for me as much as I deserve everything happening to me now. I just with the universe would give me a sign or some hope that at least one thing will go right in my miserable life. I fucking hate myself so much and I just need some people to listen and chat with me.

{"post_id": "b4gr5c", "created_utc": 1553329083, "title": "Feeling drained", "author": "OverallParticular", "self_text": "Hi all, I met my friend in first year university and we've known each other for around 10 years now. We got along really well and connected with similar energy levels, interests and life goals (that we are now achieving- yay!). I joined her friend group and became quite close to the other 3 girls in the group and we've gone on yearly trips together.\n\nSeveral months ago I noticed that something was off in our friendship, but couldn't really pinpoint what the issue was. I brought it up to her and we tried to figure out, but still couldn't and decided to keep an eye on it and address it when it became clearer. The thing that was off is mostly on my side, she has a lot of energy and I didn't really notice until I started mellowing out more. This energy has only seemed to ramp up with her new boyfriend. She enjoys life and will often 'cry' or 'exaggerate' to what I find are simple things (i.e. food, a nice view etc.). Our group chats area always filled with photos of her and her boyfriend and what they eat or do on a weekly basis. I put 'exaggerate' in quotations because I don't necessarily think that this is bad, I think it's great that she is so happy with simple pleasures. I've just found that I am constantly drained after hanging out with her and also don't really know how to respond to some of the things she says/does.\n\nThere are also moments when I find that she can be a bit mean. For example, I had invited my boyfriend's friend to a group outing because I think he's a great friend and he's always down to do things. Her immediate response was to laugh at him and make fun of him in front of me and the friend group because he's not exactly 'good-looking'. After I called her out on it, she did apologize. Other times, her advice can be a bit too much. I have a lot of issues from past childhood abuse and so my relationship is difficult to navigate through at times. Sometimes she will very directly, ask me to break up with my partner (who has supported me through going to therapy for the first time) and I've told her that this advice is hurtful to me because she doesn't comprehend the background noise that plays into my thinking in my relationship. We discussed this and she's agreed to be more supportive rather than conclusive. However, I think after several incidents, I don't really feel comfortable sharing things with her anymore.\n\nUltimately, I think she is a wonderful friend and we have a good way of communicating issues with each other. She's always open to talking and taking my perspective/feelings into consideration and I, hers (when she has them). However, I find myself dragging my feet to hang outs and not wanting to respond on group chats and when I do hang out with her, I feel drained. I don't want to leave the friendship, since I do value her and the communication we had and I also quite like the other friends in the group. What are some ways to fix things on my side and not feel so drained?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks everyone for your advice!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR** Friend for around 10 years is draining my energy/too high-energy for me now - what are some ways/things I can do to counter this?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

But here\u2019s the thing: these feelings are not reciprocated whatsoever. Additionally, I have been in 4 relationships total: and they have all been emotionally and physically abusive. So I have become incredibly jaded to the idea of dating. May sound sad, but I\u2019m really doing okay on my own. I\u2019m pretty intuitive and can tell when someone likes me, so I\u2019ve known for awhile that he has feelings for me. I was hoping I was wrong, but my gut instinct tends to always be correct. So I\u2019ve made it clear to him, multiple times, that I have zero interest in dating anyone for a long long time-maybe forever-and to be honest-I\u2019m perfectly fine with that. But this friend has been texting people in my life incessantly asking for advice and \u201cwhen should I tell her?\u201d \u201cDo you think we\u2019d be good together?\u201d \u201cHow do I tell her?\u201d And they\u2019ve all been telling him: \u201cHey man. Not a good idea. You probably shouldn\u2019t go there because it won\u2019t end well.\u201d But he\u2019s very stubborn and won\u2019t take no for an answer. And since I\u2019ve known him for so long, I know how he is when he\u2019s interested in someone. He obsesses over them for years and refuses to get over them, even when he\u2019s told that it won\u2019t work out. And I am so anxious and sick to my stomach about this because I don\u2019t want to be that person for him. I also don\u2019t want to lose a friend but it\u2019s not fair to either of us to keep going on as if nothing has happened. Especially considering his history of, as I said, refusing to get over people even when he\u2019s hit with the reality that it\u2019s not going to work. I\u2019ve been avoiding him and taking long periods of time to respond to his texts about getting together and hanging out and the sad part is that I feel very bad about it. But it\u2019s just not fair. To me, or to him. I have severe anxiety and a deep fear of confrontation (due to past experiences that, not to be dramatic, ruined my life) and I just wish this would all blow over. But I know that it won\u2019t.

I apologize for anything wrong I've done while posting and if this isn't the right place please let me know. \n\nMy life begun falling apart three years ago when my husband lost his job. It took a year for him to gain employment and during that year he chose to shut down and lie threw his teeth about anything and everything. I did get a job ( I've worked serving off and on for the past 10 years ) but with my husband spending money left and right, I couldn't keep up with it all. My biggest worry was losing our vehicle. I knew once we lost it our credit would dive and stop us from getting another one, and with no public transport in this farmville no one would have away to work. My husband kept saying he was paying the payment. Needless to say he wasn't and our vehicle got repo'd right before he started a new job. I had to ask my father for help, I endure the yelling and personal blows for a vehicle. \n\nThrew the past three years nothing has worked out. My husband got a really good job but it required him to be gone for two weeks at a time. Since we only had one car, I had no way to do anything. So for a year I sat at home. My Mother would take me places once she got done yelling at me about it. He eventually lost that job due to his own laziness and lies. He got another job where he had to work 24/7. So I still had no vehicle but at least I could feed my daughter. Then he lost that job due to no fault of his own. His boss got mad at him and just fired him. He fought to keep the job but it did no good. Now here we are. He does have a job but he hasn't been able to start it. It's been a month and they just said he will probably start next week. IDK how he will be able to go, he will be working two weeks off and one week home but we are completely broke. I'm about to have my power shut off. I've been eating crackers and ketchup for three days and I'm hungry. I'm saving the better food for my daughter. My husband lies A LOT about everything. We are both on antidepressants but for some reason he takes mine. I need them to help me get threw a past of being raped and having the video shown to my small town, my step dad molesting me and my mother blaming me and my sister called me a liar. I have been raped with beer bottles by my daughter bio dad. I've have had a really bad past that I was able to keep locked away until one day everything came out. Since then I've been depending on that medication to get me threw my days as I can't afford a therapist.  He knows all of this yet he chose to steal them and now I can't get them refilled because we have no insurance and are broke. I've been without it for three days now and I'm having a tough time keeping to together. My husband won't be able to start this job because we have no way to get him food for while hes gone. \n\nThis wasn't supposed to be my life. I'm done. I have no one to talk to because my husband is ugh, idk. He's a liar and a theif. My mother will get such joy out of this, My father will just tell me to move where he lives which was something I planned to do until he told me I couldn't being my stuff with me. He's not a wonderful father but I have to get away from living next door to my mother. Idk, this all probably makes no since but I had to get this out. I don't know what move to make next, what do I do? I'm out of moves and just have to stop trying to fight my way out of this. I'm a planner. I solve problems all the time but maybe due to my emotions I can't see my next move. I thought maybe with a outsider seeing this, perhaps someone can see something I'm not.

As John\u2019s house is slightly closer to the venue, they decide to go to John\u2019s house first, drop him off for $40 between them and Mike would pay $10 to go to his place from John\u2019s house.\n\nHalfway through he ride Mike spots a metro station and jumps off at a traffic light with no explanation to or agreement from John to change the plan. Later, Mike texts John offering to pay $5 out of the $40 John paid for the ride. John says, no, you agreed to pay your half so pay $20. Mike says it was not convenient for him to go to John\u2019s place and he would\u2019ve had to pay an extra $10 (total $30 for Mike) to get to his place, so that is why he decided to take the metro. John insists Mike needs to pay for his half. What is a fair solution for this?\n\nOption A Mike pays only $5 to John\nOption B Mike pays the full $20 to John\nOption C Mike pays $15 to John as the total cost of dropping them both would\u2019ve been $50 ($40 to John\u2019s plus $10 from there to Mike\u2019s), so John ultimately pays $25 (the $40 he paid minus $15 from Mike).

Recently she started having a crush on a guy we work with [M, 26], but didn't break up with her boyfriend. She suggested I [F, 22] sleep with the guy so he gets involved with me and she can focus on her relationship. She would talk to him every day and we would go out constantly to drink. She suggested to have a party at his place. I normally don't get drunk, but I did this time I did. Throughout the night it seemed that she was taking steps to sleep with the guy. When I sobered up and asked to go home, she didn't let me. She slept in his bed when she got tired and stayed to \"take care of me\" when I stayed at his place because I couldn't drive. She ended up doing some stuff with him and then coming to me and telling me she wanted to go home. I was pissed because not only does she always say she is against cheating, she lied to me by not letting me go home so she could use me as an excuse to stay (thats how I felt). As for the guy, me and him were sexting for about a week and sending videos and photos to each other. We never did anything physical. Except I never told her that I was doing that stuff with him. In addition, every time he would talk to me it was about sex and one day I just ended up telling him and me and my friend had a crush in him. The sexting and stuff just happened too, he was just so sweet and reminded me of my ex. He cut things off with me the morning after he did stuff with her because he said it was getting complicated. I felt like I was just the \"plan B\" that he was using until he got plan A. He said he wanted to see if he could date my friend. I'm not sure if i should tell her everything. I feel guilty. He says not to tell her because we didn't do anything physical...so there was nothing. I can't look at my friend any more without feeling guilt.

Oh, and also I\u2019d prefer talking to people ages 15-19, it\u2019d be kind of weird talking with someone that has an age beyond those boundaries. And uh... Even though my hobbies are somewhat... limited, I\u2019m fine talking about anything!\n\nAND ALSO NO NUDES OF ANY KIND!!!!!

We went to same middle schools and then went to different high schools, but kept in touch all these years. I would always make time for her and reply to her knowing she has no one to talk to in her school because its hard for her to talk to people first. From freshman year to junior year we would talk everyday because I was the only one she could talk to. Around senior year she started making friends and started replying to me less and started getting dry. When we would talk she would ignore what I said or if I talked about my friends and just kept talking about herself. Then it got to the point where we would just say morning, I got home from school then goodnight. I felt annoyed and wrote her a whole paragraph explaining how I felt and her reply was \u201cI know I realized we got distant, we should hang more!\u201d That was the only reply I received even tho I expressed more things that bothered me and it annoyed me how she saw how our friendship was drifting, but didn\u2019t care enough to fix it. After a few weeks she legit went ghost and I messaged again saying what\u2019s up, you good! Now for the third time she went ghost and I didn\u2019t care enough to message first either because all these times I reached out first when she started ignoring . Another problem was that she didn\u2019t care to solve a problem and would ignore me the whole day and text next morning pretending everything was fine. Or if I disagreed with her she would act like I\u2019m against her and would ignore me like usual and message the next day like everything fine when it wasn\u2019t. Now It\u2019s been 3 weeks and she didn\u2019t care to respond to my text or even messaged. I feel annoyed because she found new people and decided ignoring me would solve everything.

It's something she loves doing, and readily agreed that she would drive from out of state to come up and see and we'd put everything together. We also decided that we'd take a small roadtrip to get out of the city for a couple of nights. I took off a full week of work - the first time off I've had in a long time.\n\nAbout a week and a half before she was due to come up, she informs me that she's booked flights to come up rather than drive, because it was the same price she'd be paying in petrol. I was annoyed, because we'd agreed to go on the road-trip and she agreed to have the car so I could go house-shopping without going back and forth on the bus and being limited in what I could carry. I'd already said that I'd pay for the petrol on the road-trip and then some as well. It was just frustrating that she didn't talk to me about this before she made that decision. \n\nShe's now here, and we've built everything and have just been mooching around, getting brunch etc. But I'm starting to get annoyed with her presence. Every little sound bothers her (she's from the country) and makes out as if it's my fault by staring at me if things happen (I live in an apartment block, so the normal things, people banging doors, people with heavy feet in the apt above, some neighbours playing music in the evening, dogs barking), and she has no qualms about voicing it out loud, especially when something/one annoys her in public (such as walking through the shops and there's screaming kids or someone in the way...you know, little things in life that are annoyances you can't do much about). I also feel a sense of obligation of having to be present with her all the time. She doesn't really want to do anything that I want to do. \n\nI feel like I made a mistake in telling her she can stay the full week I'm off, which doesn't really give me any time to myself to relax and unwind. I wanted to go away out of the city, but she ruined that idea (I can't afford the holding deposit on a hire car) and now I really don't want her to stay anymore. I know she has friends in the city, but I also feel like it's an AITA situation if I ask her to go stay somewhere else.\n\nAny thoughts on how I can voice this without coming off like a bad person?\n\nTD;LR My friend is staying with me and helped build my furniture and I don't want her to anymore because she's flat out annoying me. I want to ask her to leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I have poor grades, and we tend to either \u00a8argue\u00a8 about that, or she will get mad when she inevitably decides I have been disrespectful and require punishment.\n\nthis all started when I woke up. she was already pissed off for some reason (neither of us had anything to do with it) and was making remarks about us either saying thing like \"this is on so I dont have to hear your annoying noises\" (I was just talking, and not to her) her or insinuating that we were stupid. she also refused to answer questions about how to do the work she gave us before we went to my cousins house.\n\nafter a while of her doing \\^that she was showing my brother how to take the trash out of the trash can (he already knows how) and being condescending and/or passive aggressive to him, and I listened for about 30 seconds before I asked her not to be passive aggressive with my brother. her response went along the lines of\n\nMom- How dare you!? have no right to talk to me like that! thats it! you arent going to our cousins\n\nme- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that, I just don't want my brother upset. please dont leave me at the house\n\nmom- do you know how take care of two kids?\n\nme- well n-\n\nmom- no? well then dont tell me how to take care of mine! you have no right to tell me what to do.\n\nme- I'm not telling you to do anything. I politely asked you not to be mean to my brother.\n\nmom- you are so rude! we are definitely leaving you here- you didnt even apologize!- we'll be back around midnight (its 3 then).\n\nme- mom the first thing I said is that I was sorry, but you know what? I'm not, because YOU, have no right to talk to B (my brother) that way! treat me like crap all you want but leave him alone.\n\nmom- we are leaving! B finish taking out the trash\n\nB, very tactfully chiming in- lol he's just gonna run away mom (he was trying to help, and get me to go)\n\nthis just makes it worse, and I end up being left at home without wifi as well, leaving me with basically nothing to do (all of our stuff is either locked or requires internet.\n\nwhen they get back, she seems fine. she tells me that shes getting food and wants me to come. I accept. we get in the car and start driving, and she goes off on a tangent all of a sudden, saying that I should've been there and eventually starts talking about how poor my grades are and that I'm so disrespectful and if I just tried a little we wouldn't ever argue, and I'm agreeing, I'm saying sorry, and that I'm trying to do better. then I make a mistake. I dont remember the exact wording of what she said, but I said that when I get disrespectful its a reaction, it builds up while she keeps going. she didnt take that well. she said that I was blaming her, said it was only my fault, and that I was fixating on her so I wouldnt take responsibility for myself. then she said the family would be happier without me, and that she would send me to foster care. I dont know if she meant the foster care part, but I did see it in the search history later.\n\nupdate- a teacher noticed I was nearly breaking down (it really hit me in the middle of school, was numb before then) and sent me to the counselor. my dumbass mentioned I went to the counselor, but didnt want to talk about why at the moment. she didnt like that very much. the conversation can be summed up as follows- \"but what about how *I* felt about you nearly breaking down in class? did you think about how I feel? you're so selfish!\" she also doubled down whenever I mentioned why I was upset, saying that she didnt want to get rid of me but yeah, the family would be happier without me.

I've never felt happier than the first two years of our friendship, but I've also never been made to feel as shitty as she has made me feel in the past two years. It seems that she treats me so poorly because she knows she can swoop in with a heartfelt apology and it will all be okay. So my question is... how do I let her know that she can't keep using the promise of my forgiveness as an excuse to be a bad friend? I will always love her and can't imagine my life without her, but the person I feel so strongly for has not been present in our friendship for years.\n\nIn the past two years, I have been in really poor health, with chronic pain and several incurable diseases. This tragedy has only given me more of a zest for life, and a desire to be kinder to the people around me. In the past two years, she has gotten a major promotion, has been accepted to a prestigious graduate program, she's getting recognition as an accomplished musician, she has a boyfriend whom she loves, and her health is excellent--but she's been so mean to me. \n\nWhen she first started being mean to me, I had no idea what was happening, and kept denying that it was intentional, but it was breaking me down. When I finally confronted her, she confessed that she was purposefully taking out her rage (unknown source) on me. After the shock of that, I forgave her and she stopped being outright mean to me. Though she was no longer outright mean, she continued to be unpleasant and dreary all the time. She has been so difficult to be around, because she takes out her bad moods on other people and is always looking for a fight. I feel like I am constantly walking on egg shells and every decision I make I have to weigh how it will affect her. I put more consideration into her well-being than my own, because when she is in a bad mood everyone around her suffers. Normally I would cut ties with someone so toxic, but she recently confessed to me that she's been so insufferable because she is depressed. I know depression intimately, and feel very sorry for her if she's telling the truth, but the odd thing is that it felt like another cop out from a very manipulative person.\n\nAny advice for how to support someone who is going through depression when they treat you like shit? I still love her and want to help her, but I also want her to know that the way she's been acting is really really hard on me.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Before I go into detail as to what I\u2019m really looking for.. here is a few details you should know. See the heading.... yeah that\u2019s my main goal and I do that because I can\u2019t be sitting idle. \n\nAbout me: I am a senior student in college about to graduate and thus me being 21. In all honesty it\u2019s tough to describe myself. I will try... I think I am funny, can help people and keep topics everlasting.  I know I am loving, gentle and caring. I have been brought up in an all boys school and it sucked. Literally sucked. I have no idea how to take care for the opposite gender nor the same gender but I do know how to stand up and appreciate them and help them when needed. \n\nI\u2019ve been gracious for my parents teaching me values of love and care. But somehow when I do care and love, the people I meet and know drift away. It might be that I care too much. Maybe.. to give you an example: I had a friend whom I cared for and helped like a sister. After she got in a relationship she forgot me. But I didn\u2019t. I send her texts every now and then but she usually kills it. I\u2019ve not seen her in two years and after she reached out with a problem I still quit what I was doing and helped her. She went away after that and never back. All she needed was my help. \n\nI will and would stand up for/care/love anybody be it random strangers or friends because I care. Therefore my post here... I want someone to care for and listen to even if they keep me up all night. If you had a bad day tell me and I\u2019ll keep quiet while you talk. I\u2019ll be the shoulders to cry on or be happy on. I miss the feeling of my heart excitedly beating when I show care and love and affection to people. I will never let a conversation die and I don\u2019t do small talk. \n\nI can talk in discord or messenger or DM\u2019s here. Shoot me a message if you want to. Know that if you do, I\u2019ll be excited. \n\nPS: if you have made it this far without cringing or thinking I\u2019m needy.. you are awesome! Hope you have a great day and know that someone believes in you!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We're looking for more female friends to hang with and hoped we can find some here! We're both in different countries, so we mostly just play different games and chat on discord. Sometimes we watch movies/series together or just sit around in calls too. We both love gaming so we'd love it if you did too, so we could have more people to join us :)\n\n**Introduction A:** I'm 23yrs old and from Sweden. I own 2 cats that hate each other and I mostly work night shifts, so I'm up at crazy hours during the night even when I'm free. I'll send you about 10,000 pictures of my cats without you even needing to ask. And this is totally not L typing this next part, no no: I watch a *crazy* amount of movies. Like 10 a day. 1000 every week. I don't know how she does it. *She just watches everything.* *It's mildly unnerving.* \n\n**Introduction L:** 20 years old and currently neighboring in Finland! usually up all hours of the night too, because A is a horrible influence on me and my sleep schedule. I'm more of a dog person myself and love things like hiking and reading god awful romance books. I also have a tendency of making her lose brain cells because damn, my jokes are awful :) ^(like the rest of me)\n\n# \ud83d\udc4f What we got to offer \ud83d\udc4f\n\n* Tons of fun, like loooads of fun (no warranty included)\n* Loads of games (well, like, a small load) including Stardew Valley, The Forest, League of Legends (EUW), Don't Starve Together and pin the tail on the donkey. We're always up for more games though! It's how we spend a lot of our time because there's really not a lot else to do long-distance. Please convince A to play minecraft though. Because. She. Won't. Do. It. And I give up.\n* Movie/show nights! We already have a habit of watching movies together while sitting in a call or something, so it'd be pretty fun to have more people to watch horror movies or trash horrible romcoms with.\n* Active chats. We both love chatting and we're pretty active throughout the day with messaging on discord. Having a group chat going would be pretty cool.\n* Friends to lean on. We both have our own problems and know how hard it can be to have nobody to talk to. Either of us would definitely love to be there for you, even if it's just listening to a really long rant. Life sucks sometimes.\n* L's brain cell removal service\n* and loads of fun btw ^(warranty still not included)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \ud83c\udf53 Who are we looking for? \ud83c\udf53\n\n* We're only looking for girls at the moment, because that's our comfort zone.\n* Preferably around our age, so we aren't at totally different stages in our lives (18-25)\n* *Needs* dark humor\n* We're on discord only, so having discord is a requirement.

She let down her guard to me making her super sensitive (not a negative) and I called her \u201cannoying\u201d knowing that\u2019s not what I meant but it\u2019s the word I decided to use which at the time was a huge mistake.

Now why is me letting my emotions take over so bad? It\u2019s for the simple fact that my emotions are always negative and defensive against things that there\u2019s no need to be defensive for.

I told him that its not a biggie and that he shouldnt worry about it. He eventually asked me if I would help him lose it,(meaning we would sleep together) which made me very uncomfortable so I asked for a bit of space. \n\nWe didnt talk for about a month before i saw on snapchat that he had moved in with Bob.

{"post_id": "b5soq2", "created_utc": 1553621922, "title": "Trying to reconnect with a friend who scorned me (Long)", "author": "RogueClassHero", "self_text": "It's a bit of a long story, but I'll keep as brief while trying to add context. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, for about a year, I became really good friends with a person online, and through an MMO. We hit it off, and honestly she became one of the closest friends I'd ever had, and ever expected to have, let's call her Sue-Ellen. To put it in perspective for closeness, we voice chatted via Discord virtually every day and whenever we both were able, we just really enjoyed each other's company. After a few months, she introduces me to one of her IRL best friends she's known for years, and I hit it off with them too, let's call her Clarissa. Basically, the three of us became incredibly close, inseparable. I talked to Sue more frequently though, often in the morning and before I went to work, because she really didn't have anyone else she was close to at that time that she could talk to. I'd kept the practice of telling her \"Good morning/have a great day!\" every morning from a time when she was in the hospital, and was very alone. I wanted to reassure her I was there, and she wasn't alone in her life. It really helped as she would tell me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, her having problems and me being there for her to help her through them would be a common recurring theme. Often I'd hear her out and give advice as well, but a lot of the time she'd ignore advice. To put it in perspective, she'd had someone she was dating, but found out they had been cheating and broke up with them, let's call him Dick. I helped her through this. She got messages from him saying he's changed, and I told her not to do it, to just move on and block him. She didn't, and then decided to try it again with them, only to discover he was still cheating, and he ended up telling her never to speak to him again, which deeply upset her. I would end up flying out to meet her and hang out with her and Clarissa (Not because of the breakup, that happened like 2 days prior, and I had been planning to visit for months). We both helped her get over it, and she told me that she had felt the happiest and the most content than she had ever felt in years, and honestly so did I. We all basically reaffirmed that we were really close, and had forged a lifelong friendship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLess than a month later, she tells me she forgot to block Dick on something, and is contemplating sending an emoji onto one of his posts. I tell her this is a horrible idea, and she needs to just block him and move on, he's wasted chances, gas-lit her, etc. She ends up doing it, gets messages from him, and lets him back into her life as a friend again, only he wants to be more than that and she doesn't. She ends to complaining every few days about him to me, and every-time I offer advice and tell her to just cut ties and block him, I get hit with an \"I don't know...\" and nothing gets done. She starts to kinda talk to me less and less, and be with other people on the MMO we play more and more. \"That's alright,\" I say to myself, \"I don't own her, she can have other friends.\" I was okay with that, not that she needed my approval though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, now whenever she did have the time to talk to me, it'd often be bitter, coarse, and just generally have the vibe of \"I could be doing something else right now.\" Before this, she used to pick up on when I was having a bad day and talk to me about it, and she would tell me if she had a bad day, and talk about it with me. There was just a general sense of openness. Anytime either of us just didn't feel great or felt down or unsure of things, we both reassured each other \"I love you a lot friend, I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here for you.\" Now she never wants to talk about anything, and if I mention anything about not having a good time/day or whatever, it's met with \"I don't know what you want me to do.\" She would do the same to Clarissa too, and she started to leave us both by the wayside for other people she would meet, particularly one person named Elijah. She would spend every waking moment with this person, and almost no one else. Once we tried to get just the three of us to do something in the MMO together, just us three for old times' sake, and she got incredibly offended that we didn't want to have Elijah along. I would bring these concerns to her, tell her that I felt we were becoming distant when we were so close before, and how she speaks to me differently now. She would tell me I'm being irrational, we're still as close as we were before, or sometimes admit she was getting distant, apologize, and start deriding herself as \"a horrible friend,\" while never actually trying to fix anything or get close again. It was inconsistent, and it made me crazy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis goes on for close to 3 months since I visited, and eventually I decide to leave the gaming community we're in inside this MMO. I left because I felt alone, as I really only ran stuff with Sue-Ellen and Clarissa, and Clarissa's sub had run out for a little while, and Sue-Ellen either wouldn't have time to run anything with me anymore, or would just be really irritable/unwelcoming if she did. She wasn't really subtle in making it known she'd rather be doing something else. It just made me feel like a hindrance to her. (This itself was made worse because of my current bout of depression I've been battling for years; I constantly battle with the idea of being worthless, not truly being loved, only being a burden to everyone, etc.) Anyway, after leaving the community, I'm met with a barrage of angry Discord messages berating me for leaving. \"How dare you\" this and \"You're a coward...I know you're hideously f---ing depressed, but be an adult about things.\" I try to explain why I left, but she deletes me in about 5 minutes of replying. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiven how distant we'd been growing for the past few months, it doesn't bother me too much. It actually felt a bit good to get closure in a sense. It was better to know she truly didn't want me around than to always be unsure and told otherwise. Eventually she starts texting my actual number, telling me to fix things, to join back, and guilting me by telling me I've abandoned people, including Clarissa. This was not true at all, as Clarissa would tell me she understood and respected my decision. (Honestly during and after this whole mess, Clarissa was there for me far more, and she has her own problems she deals with. Without her help, I don't know where I'd be right now). After spending a few hours trying to reason with Sue-Ellen, and her not listening to me, she just tells me to stop talking and not bother. \"Ok\" I reply, and stop talking to her for a week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn that period of a week, she goes about being passive aggressive (making rude emotes at my player character in the MMO, leaving passive aggressive messages on my house's logbook, etc.), and she openly expresses her dislike and hatred of me to members of the former community and Clarissa, making them incredibly uncomfortable. Someone defends my decision to leave, and she gets infuriated with them, and just rage quits everything for the night. Clarissa apologizes for Sue-Ellen's actions and words to everyone. God bless her, she didn't have a mean bone in her body, and didn't deserve to be put in that position. Later that night Sue-Ellen texts me that she's returning a gift I got her for Christmas. For me, this was the last chance to be civil and apologize that just got thrown out the window. I don't reply, I just block her on everything, and move on with me life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLife starts to feel amazing, the new community I'm in is warm and receptive and just really friendly and welcoming. However, even after blocking the number, I get two voicemails a few weeks later from Sue-Ellen saying she misses me, she's sorry, etc. Honestly I feel a slight pang of pity, but don't give in. However, Clarissa, still in contact with Sue-Ellen, tells me that after visiting her recently, she seems more apologetic and thinks that she might have realized how badly she screwed up. She tells me she understands if I still don't want to, but that the option to be friends again with Sue-Ellen is still there. After a week or so of thinking it over, I awkwardly and slowly reconnect. I do so mostly because I think it's unfair to put Clarissa in the position of having two best friends that hate each other. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat more or less brings us to now. We've been reconnected for maybe about a month or so, but hardly talk. Sue-Ellen appears apologetic and wants things to go back to normal, but I just have these intense feelings of doubt, mistrust and indifference. I don't feel comfortable around her anymore like I used to, and just generally view her as deceitful. I don't hate her, but I don't trust her anymore, and any image I'd had of her as a great person and close friend (as close as family basically) no longer exists. I feel stuck, because I also hate putting Clarissa in this position still. I know she really wants the three of us to be close again, but in all honesty I don't know if that's ever going to happen again. I've certainly grown closer to Clarissa, but as for Sue-Ellen, I don't know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr Very, very close friend in a friendship triangle disowns me, then wants everything to go back to normal, but I don't trust her anymore, and don't know if I can, but don't want to isolate our mutual best friend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading this whole thing if you did. I can provide further context if needed/prompted when I can, I know I've probably left some things out as my brain is really scatterbrained atm. Any advice is appreciated!

So about a year and a half ago, I (29) met this guy (30). We started off as friends, were friends for about 4 months, before we started seeing each other. I wasn't very interested initially (besides friendship), but he was so into me and tried hard to make me go out with him. He always told me how beautiful he thinks I am, how he admires me for who I am, and he always made time to see me and to call me. And eventually I fell for him. We were seeing each other for about four months, without ever talking about being in a relationship, but we did talk about being exclusive (and both agreed that we aren't seeing other people at the moment), and we spend tons of time together, basically we did everything what a relationship consists of without calling it one. I even met his parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast August, after seeing each other for over four months, I asked him where this is going. He said that we'll never be boyfriend and girlfriend, that what we have is as far as it gets, that he generally isn't interested in relationships and that he finds the concept of relationships ridiculous and doesn't believe in monogamy. I was pretty sad for a bit, but then we talked again and agreed that we could try to be friends, since we started off as friends and since I thought he's a great person that I don't wanna lose completely. He made it clear that he isn't interested in relationships in general and doesn't want to be in one (he only had one gf in is life and said it was terrible), he's also still quite immature, so I didn't take it personal. Of course I didn't believe that he would never ever be in a relationship, but I really thought at this point it's not about me, it's about him just not wanting one or being ready for a serious commitment. We became pretty good friends afterwards actually, and everything seemed to go well, we even both went on dates with other people, and everything seemed fine til a couple of weeks ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of weeks ago, he went on a Tinder date, and now he seems to have changed his opinion about relation ships suddenly. He barely even knows her, but he has already told me that she's amazing and that they might be making things official soon. I was kinda shattered when I heard that. She's less attractive than me which I guess doesn't matter in the end, and he's been seeing her for way shorter time than he was seeing me. The point of this is that I think he lied to me back then. He WAS ready for a relationship, just not with me. A tale as old as male lies I guess. I'm just really hurt that he actually lied to me back then, since I wasn't just a random hook up. I was a girl he already knew for a while, someone he was friends with before, someone he was seeing for months exclusively, and still he looked me in the eye and lied to me. I don't believe that someone 'grows up' just within months. I just wasn't right for him, and he didn't have the balls to tell me. And even if back then he believed it himself (that he never wants a relationship), it somehow doesn't matter to me. Every time I see him now, I feel hurt. Every time I see him it reminds me that apparently I wasn't good enough for him. Every time I see him it reminds me that he'd rather be with that other girl than with me. I didn't think I still had any feelings for him, but it hurts more than I expected. And honestly, right now I cannot even imagine to be somewhere with our group of friends, and his new girl is there with him, and I see them kissing and holding hands. I just can't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thought of losing him as a friend hurts, but I also don't wanna feel hurt anymore. What would you do? Should I stop seeing him (as a friend, obvs)? Should I cut every contact for now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Loretta now knows that Tammy is trying to get with her man and Jessica is still acting like she\u2019s loyal to Tammy and I\u2019m not sure if I should tell Tammy or how should I tell her I want to stay out of this drama but of course I need to tell Tammy of someone being fake to her because she would tell me too but I don\u2019t want to break up a friendship and cause even more drama!!! \n\nDisclaimer: I am 100% against Tammy getting with Loretta\u2019s man and I told her she was horrible for trying to do that \n\nWhat should I do??? What would you do??", "subreddit": "friendship"}

We have classes together and hes invested in the friendship too so he will want to know exactly why. Its not like I havent tried before I just care about him. Oh also hes my neighbor!

I might be a little hurt but I know she has other friends. But I don't like that she's lying to me. She has no reason to. If she asked me about my day I would give her a play by play. What makes this worse is when we first started hanging out she went on and on about how she hates liars and I went on and on about similar peeves. Here she is doing the exact thing she hates. I've been acting like I don't know any better. But I'm hurt. I know I should just not look at her location but that is a hard temptation to resist.

I've met some great people on here and I hoped I can meet some more interesting people to become friends with.  \n\nI just recently graduated from college with a degree in film. I suffer from both anxiety and depression. It effects me a lot on day to day basis mostly depression. Some days I'm fine Some I'm not. So if I complain about being depressed please understand I can't control it and at least be sympathetic towards it. Also it takes me time to open up to other so be considering of that. \n\nI'm a very shy, lonely and boring person. I have a hard time making conversation so I might be boring to talk to. I will try my best. I don't have much in life as I'm searching for work at the moment. It's gets annoying when someone asks what you up to every few second because I have nothing at the moment sadly. So I recommend not asking that often lol. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, Star Wars, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Game of Thrones, The Handmaid's Tale, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. So feel free to give me suggestions \n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. I love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). I enjoy learning about history/political science in school. I also read comic books and watch WWE. \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03.

Don't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. Also don't be a creep, I had unfortunate incident once. I have kik, discord, and Snapchat but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now. I prefer the pm message box and not the chat but whatever works for you.

I wouldn't really describe myself as shy either. Totally different thing. I'm also planning a trip to Scotland this summer with my friends, really excited about that. I also love talking about music I primarily like alternative/rock/oldies music.  I'm really not interested in talking politics either.

I don't have that much clarity yet I know I need to tell about myself. What's the best format for that, the best structure to write? Feels this might be a long post. Well I'm starting from somewhere, I like to listen to music a lot like how I'm just doing now. There's a big spectrum here, sometimes I want something dreamy and floaty then sometimes there are clear strong beats, sometimes enjoying the lyrics and sometimes just a repeating sample catches your attention. I'm busy all day, getting up early (it doesn't easy at all?) and leave for the lectures then coming back home all tired. Sadly I'm not managing my time greatly that's one of the things that make me feel like I'm not able to do what I wish. I mean if you just lay down on your bed while looking at your phone or your laptop when you come home, there isn't much time left for any other thing you want to do. That's my case, I wan to change that yet I feel tired and try to get rest endlessly. Yes, I think I'm being lazy about many things. Also sometimes for some periods of time, I find it hard to focus but I never attempt in the first place, that feeling stops me right there. It sucks when you can't focus on the things you usually or used to enjoy doing a lot; like reading, writing, watching a film or an episode or studying hah. Yeah I still need to study but I rarely manage to do that. However I love learning, many subjects are absolutely interesting to me. I'm studying medicine, there were many reasons behind my decision and I followed my desire to start to walk this path. It's a long road for sure and I have my own pace. I wanted to become a psychiatrist since I have a big interest in that area, it's still an option but I still have my doubts as well. Another thing is I like how there are my options in this field, I love always having options in life. Good thing is I have some time until I need to make such a decision, yet I need to study for pre-graduation and post-graduation exams regardless. Whenever I study and learn about a subject, I love it but somehow I rarely manage to do it. I have my theories on that fact and I believe I can improve. I have a lot of failures I think but I still believe in myself haha. It's not just medicine that excites me. I like philosophy, psychology, psychoanalysis, nature, history, commentary and analysis of visual, animated or written works. I sure I enjoy many other small and big things too but who could make a full list? Apparently it's not me.Though I'm a big fan of just relaxing and doing nothing too, especially that's what I've been doing the most for some time. I think I mentioned how I can't manage doing the other things I like to do at times. I was much better in the past. I miss that but it's okay to have such periods through life. One thing I'm still good at is enjoying food and sleep yet I could improve eating healthy and quality of my sleep. Okay I'm starting to feel like I'm telling way too much about myself now so maybe it's time to stop. Maybe I can add a few things though, I think I'm rather kind and non-judging person. Yet I see many repulsive things done by many people sometimes which kills my instinctive loving approach and make me \"hate\" humans with a desire of isolation. I don't know, I'm all about relativity, alternatives and even uncertainty of things but right and wrong look pretty clear sometimes. Even if it's not crystal clear, you can sense it. So hail decent people! Long live good intentions! \n\nBe kind and find courage, those are some words from Cinderella I think? I like it.\n\nI promise I'm not against using paragraphs. I just went with this format since there were no paragraphs on my mind with clear differentiation. I feel like you might enjoy this format if you are a fan of The Waves by Virginia Woolf. Please don't get this as smugness but I want to congratulate myself for writing this. Nothing to be praised by the nature yet just being able to write this without clarity would be hard for me and I know I would end up not writing at all. No writing, no hints to the world and the minds of you lovely people. Hints about how I am, who I am, my potential, my background. If it ends up mildly endearing or interesting to you, please feel free to write to me. Friends wanted and welcome.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Let me just start with that I have known these people ever since grade school and we are about to graduate high school together and go to college. I've always been outcast but never really bothered me because I still hung out with them. We usually talk on discord, and up until 2 weeks ago everything was fine. However a person we will call \"M\" told the group that they should make a new server without me, and they did. I tried asking for invites but they either pretend it doesn't exist or its a lot better without me.\n\n2 weeks later this continues but they treat me alright during school. Prom is approaching and I ask my friends what the plans are; they say they do not know. I believe them up until this week where they insist on saying that they do not know (prom is this weekend). I eventually pull a person we will call \"J\" to the side, and he tells me everything. He tells me that 4 people (including M) told him and the rest of the group not to invite me to prom with them, and they make fun of me a lot in discord. He also said they don't want to talk to me or invite me because I am going to annoy them, and they do not want to deal with it. I should also mention that prom tables are reserved in advance, and I had reserved us all a table. But what J told me was that they had planned to switch tables at prom so that they do not have to deal with me.\n\nI am unsure how to handle my friends both with prom, and in general.

I'm a trans girl in her 20s looking to make a few new friends who share similar interests. Truth be told a lot of my friends are either busy or aren't really around anymore, so I've felt kind of lonely as of late. I'd like to make some new friends, preferably long-term, that I could feel close with &amp; talk to about anything. I also tend to get along better with other girls, but definitely not a requirement.\n\nTo be honest I think I'm a pretty decent conversationalist, willing to talk about anything, and am \\*usually\\* very open and honest with the people around me. Really, you can ask me almost anything and it won't bother me. Whether you're up for a darker conversation, or just need to vent, I'd love to listen. I'm a little shy at first, but after I warm up to someone I'm usually the exact opposite -- truth be told I can sometimes be a little too chatty as I love to have long and in-depth conversations, but if that's not your cup of tea just let me know. \n\nAnyway, I'm currently in my last year and half of college and moving into a dorm next week (living with roommates should be... interesting, how have any of your experiences with roommates been?), a very big fan of video games/e-sports, anime (though I haven't watched as much recently), movies, TV Shows (just got into Love, Death, &amp; Robots and Black Mirror and have loved both) and just about everything else people on this sub seem to enjoy. :p \n\nAlso I don't mean to be rude, but I'm really not looking for acquaintances that I'd talk to once in a blue moon, or people who tend to respond with one or two word answers. I'm sorry if that seems petty, but I just feel like we won't really click if that's the case. :x Alongside that I obviously am not interested in speaking with anyone who is blatantly racist/sexist/anti-LGBTQ+, etc. \n\nI think I'll leave it at that so I don't bore anyone any more with this rather dull introduction as I'm really, really bad at these. So please, PM me or post here and tell me about yourself! What are your hobbies? Your favorite movies, games, or TV shows? What is it that you're passionate about? I'd love to hear whatever random facts or stories you have about yourself that you'd be willing to share! I tend to almost exclusively use Discord so it'd be great if we could communicate through there, though I'm willing to use another app if it suits you better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

After a number of not-so-pleasant interactions I found the only way for me to not make fellow rugrats run away screaming. I started to focus all of my mighty toddler brainpower into acting as normal and invisible as possible. I carried that habit through most of my adolescent life, getting a good old \"Oh noo he is weirddd\" face whenever I would accidentally get comfortable enough to make a joke I find funny.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still don't have the right amount of self control and emotional intelligence to actually have a good time when I go out to have a few drinks, but I find texting is just impersonal enough for interacting with another human to not feel about as exciting as vacuuming all the mosquitoes at 3AM because I'm too dysfunctional to properly fix the net.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from being put in a straitjacket for trying to borrow your friends eyeball without permission, mental health is not really a thing in Serbia. Despite spending half of my life on the internet, the extent of my understanding of ADHD was that they use the diagnosis as an excuse to sell pressed speed to silly kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was until one day,  just because of the sheer volume of random shit that I start obsessively reading about on the internet, I found myself reading an actual, scientific explanation of the condition, and browsing the ADHD subreddit after. Boom, I have found my long lost brethren. I found I'm not as insane as I thought and that I just belong to a particular subspecies of weirdos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn hindsight, I think in most of my good friendships the other person either was ADHD themselves, or really understood that part of me. So I guess the point of this wall of text is, I think it would be nice to know another person like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm studying computer science.

I can talk just about anything. I don't really subscribe to any ideology or religion, nor the religion of atheism, and I might call you out on your bullshit if you come out of your echo chamber to sing the song of your people to me. I have a problem with people who are too nice and can't call me out on my bullshit. I don't like anime and the current meme culture. When I talk to people, I like to talk my ass off or just do something more interesting instead. I don't watch TV while texting or talk to 5 people at once, and I don't send only 5 word messages with two words being \"lol xd\".

We used to live together for a year in our college years. Living together was great! We'd watch films together, do our shopping together and just spend a lot of time together, talking for hours on end. It was truly wonderful.\n\nThe trouble began when I moved to a different city. Suddenly, our whole relationship changed. She would not message me anymore, only if she needs something. I'd keep messaging her every few days, send her links, memes, videos, like we've always done, but she'd leave me on \"seen\" for days. Sometimes she'd see my message and not respond for 5-6 days!\n\nWe had a falling out after an episode like this, when my new cat fell out of the window of our top floor and we had to take her to an emergency vet, it was very stressful as she was a small kitten and could have very easily died. After I messaged Rose about it and she left me on seen, I had enough and messaged her saying how I don't feel like I'm having a friend in her in tough situations. Her response was along the lines of \"I can't just stop my life for you, just because your cat fell out of a window!\". This hurt me, because its not like I want so much, I just want a friend who will be there for me. I said I've had enough and stopped talking to her for a few weeks;\n\nI did went back to her, me messaging her first to apologise. I said I'm sorry, I miss her as a friend and I don't wanna fight. She jumped right back in, saying how happy she was that we're friends again etc. But... not a week later, i was being left on seen again. Weeks passed. I'd pop her a \"Hi!\" on monday, she'd see it and not respond at all. I'd then message her on friday, 5 days later, saying \"Hi?\" again and she'd leave me on seen. So I had enough for a second time and I told her that she can't just do that and that friendship is a two way street. I don't want so much from her. I only want a simple response. Maybe a small chit-chat once every 2-3 days. She says she doesn't mind skipping weeks without talking because \"I'll be there for the major life stuff!\" to which I responded \"I can't feel close to someone I haven't spoken in ages and just update them every time a big event happens in my life, this is not how friendships work, this is how Facebook works\".\n\nWe had a big fight over the same thing a second time. This time she said some hurtful things like \"You know, you'll be in more pain than me if we were to stop being friends\" and \"Just get over it!\". I told her I'm done as I was quite hurt. I haven't really spoken to her since early November. I know she CAN deal with a long-distance friendship, because she has one more friend that lives in a different city and while we lived together I'd hear and see her talk to him on daily basic, sometimes all night. I also kept asking her how she was, I know some people can be going through a hard time so I did my best to be there for her if she needed me to, but she never said anything was wrong;\n\nBut I'm lonely. Its been a few months now... This new city is a lot smaller and I can't find other like minded people and me and her knew each other for so long, I felt like I can truly be myself with her and I miss that. She was a big part of my life in the last few years and I feel sad that I can't share my life with her. As I said, I moved to a new city, had to find an apartment, started a new job, it was an extremely stressful time of my life and she was nowhere to be found during that time. I felt lonely then and reached out for her but she never responded and was always very angry when I tried to explain how I feel about her suddenly losing all interest in being a friend of mine. I'd message her, ask her how her day was, how life is etc and she'd just give me one worded answers and never ask about how my life in the new city is.\n\nI forgive easily, I don't like fights, I don't like being against people so I tend to try and make things work. I've been thinking about potentially messaging her again, apologising and maybe trying to make things work somehow as I still remember all our good memories, but I'm scared of having a \"ghost friend\" again - someone who's never around and doesn't think any of my day-to-day struggles is worth her time.

Should I message him?", "author": "sunstrokeghostdance", "self_text": "I failed at keeping this short... I am more than willing to post details if it would help! TLDR at bottom.\n\nI had a friend throughout elementary and highschool (moved into gr 2, so a total of at least 11 years, and we stayed in touch after highschool for a bit - so maybe 13 years of knowing him). Let's call him Steven. \n\nIn elementary, Steven always had a crush on me. And I crushed back at one point. Being a kid who just wanted to be loved, and who respected this boy, I \"dated\" him (quotations because I dont know what people consider to be legitimate dating). He was my first kiss, lol. We were about 13. It lasted roughly 6 months. But we stayed friends after the break up. I think... maybe his crush never died out. I dont know! \n\nWe drifted back and forth in highschool between talking lots and talking very little. Highschool is a weird time.\n\nWe graduated together and became a bit closer again in adulthood. At this point, I was sure his feelings for me had died out. He was just.. My best friend. The friend I'd play online games with, go for walks with, the kind I could send gross faces to over snapchat and know he'd make fun of me, but accept me regardless.\n\nWe are about 19, and he gets a girlfriend. Forgive me if things get kind of complicated? - it was a weird time. \n\nAnyway, i am so happy for him! FINALLY my sweet friend has a romantic partner to love him like he deserves, and he definitely doesnt like me that way! Except... she's extremely insecure. And I am his female best friend. \n\nHe messages me out of the blue one day basically terminating our friendship. He said i only go to him for attention, that I am using him, that it is unfair to him.\n\n I am heartbroken to say the least... Confused. If I had used him, I was unaware of it. I... have lost my best friend. I didnt understand. He had never talked to me about feeling this way before... \n\nI had a private instagram around this time. I didnt care too much about my privacy anyway. Let anyone follow. I posted about my heartbreak. I get a comment from an account I had recently allowed to follow me, saying i should \"see things from his perspective\". I'm so thrown off by this, i direct message them, and upon creeping their profile: private account, following about 300 people, has about 10 followers. Profile pic even seems weird. \n\nMysterious account and I are direct messaging each other. After a few messages, unable to hold back my suspicion, I flat out said \"hey, not judging, but is this (Steven's girlfriend)?\" Immediately she admitted that yes, it was her on an alternate account, that she has extreme insecurity issues and shes jealous of me. \n\nAt this point I start thinking, hey, maybe I am not in the wrong - maybe Steven's girlfriend forced him to do this. i understand the insecurity - i had never made my boyfriends end friendships, but i have definitely felt rotten over them. I get jealous and insecure. I have never made a fake account and commented, but still... \n\nI just let it go, even though i was hurt and confused. I thought maybe hes finally happy and if i had to be out of the picture, okay. \n\nI find out a year later that I have borderline personality disorder - basically because i had been starved for attention as a child. Hold up!! WAS i only going to him for attention? WAS i using him? Maybe he had a point. Or was it his girlfriend? I just dont know - and that is why i am posting about this. \n\nI am almost 25 now, and i still think of him, if not daily then at least weekly. I dont expect to ever rekindle the friendship, but... basically i want to know if anyone else thinks i should message him and apologize if i hurt him, let him know of my diagnosis, and that i never meant to be an ass, but i'm sorry that i was (?). EVEN IF it was his girlfriend's doing. Like... He must have felt some truth in what he said to me, right? I think maybe his girl prompted him, but maybe i really was a shitty, mentally ill and undiagnosed friend to him. Maybe he truly felt wronged by me. \n\n\nTLDR one of my best friends ended our friendship and i dont know if it was because of me, or because of his girlfriend, or both. I find out soon after i have Borderline Personality disorder. 6 years later, i still want to message him and at least apologize. Should i, or should i just leave it be?

I avoid social media in general because it is a degenerative distraction, and one I'm not terribly savvy with unfortunately. It interests me, but I see it as a threat at the moment while I struggle make my real world livable, as everyone must understand from time to time if not all the time. \n\nNote: Hopefully my writing doesn't come off as being a total smart-ass. I'm seventeen and have friends who use proper vocabulary and punctuation as I do. Then again my punctuation might be sub-par. Haha, I'd boast about my grave while digging it-- \n\nThe problem with my friends is that I am smarter than them. I don't say this to come off as an attention-seeking judgmental brat of a child who claims intelligence over other people--but I have deemed this to be my dilemma.\n\nI always give better advice than them and listen better than them. It all goes unappreciated.  \nI live in a crappy little town full of very idiotic people who talk to cracks in the sidewalk all day long, from children to the elderly. I know a lot of people who sit around making more problems for themselves all day (which is a social norm) and have absolutely no lives at all, let alone retain any piece of information fed to them unless it's straight from the news, or some other unreliable source. The worst part is that they are content living their. . .what I would call hellishly boring lives.  \nMaybe they are secretly all smarter than me or something insane, which I have been anti-social enough to consider and weigh, but from what I can tell, in short, I am smarter than them. \n\nIntelligence not measured by IQ. My version of \"smart\" does not revolve around straight-A students and whatever people think makes someone smart. I don't actually know what makes someone smart, nor why I am smart, but I know I am, and could go on a big long rant about my theories on why and how, but my god, this post is long enough as is and doesn't need to include my life's story.   \n^(Fun fact though; doctors told my mom I was going to be born with down-syndrome. Aha! look at me now! Ranting about my intelligence online like a typical teenager who thinks they know everything.) \n\nI know I'm not the only person who is surrounded by stupid people who give poor advice and don't know up from down. My feelings are shared in this era of madness, and possibly every, but is there any kid around my age? Everyone seems to amalgamate to what they are told. They're absolute copies of their parents, and they have no opinions nor judgement nor ability to think or do without instruction. \"They're all made of ticky-tacky and they all look just the same\".\n\nPerhaps this is a common dilemma for an under-the-surface society I'm simply unaware exists.    \nIt wouldn't surprise me for someone to throw articles in my face directing me to all the answers for my problems. The World Wide Web is so extensive, that of course, it wouldn't surprise me, but it would help me--and if I am wrong and there are no resources pertaining to this exact problem of mine, then my attempt of this post has failed and I am to further try and solve this problem myself. I work solo in the problem-solving-department.\n\nI've never had a person to look up to, even as a child, or win my interest, and I've never considered myself as someone hard to impress. These two considerations collide into a great fear that I'll either *not understand myself* or *not be understood*. \n\nI think I may be conditioned around particularly stupid people. Coincidentally only meeting people who could drive me to believe that I am truly alone in this world, but if I am alone, then other people are too--they're just not around me, ever, coincidentally. Hence why I'm turning to the internet. This is my first attempt to reach out to a community instead of bitching behind curtains. Hopefully my attempt is not futile. I'm currently keeping blindly optimistic. \n\nI know that I am not a genius child. In fact, I know so little that I'm begging the internet to hand me someone who knows the back of their hand. I know I don't know everything. \n\nIt messes me up that I'm smarter than everyone I know, because of how much I know I don't know. \n\nI crave knowledge *and* comradery. I want a friend who is smarter than me, or wiser than me if you will. I literally want a friend who can say that I'm wrong and tell me how it is, or give advice when I'm desperate to--I don't know--solve a petty problem with simple answers, or have someone to elaborate with and find more answers correlating to anything ever, if I'm making sense.\n\nI want a friend who has knowledge pertaining to a word I barely know the meaning to--that sounds stupid, doesn't it.\n\nPerhaps this friend has a drive to do something with their lives; this I have not found!   \nEveryone keeps referencing memes instead of making their own jokes. They recite pop culture references instead of saying anything relevant, (I do this from time to time too when it *is* relevant--but what's this crap about sending full-blown lyrics to people by direct-messaging? I disapprove! \"so childish\", says the seventeen year old!), they also have no drive to thrive or create things or make something of themselves. No goals, no dreams, no ability to solve their own problems. It's so fascinating to me because I can barely fathom why they lack ambition and a will to live--They just brag about their medications and diagnoses, of which there always more to be had, and then get away with it because, well, that's the social norm. \n\nI really am an odd one out.\n\nPerhaps I'm just a lost cause. A fluke. I've never fit in with any group; never looked up to anyone; and suck at conforming like my peers who believe anything and everything they are told. I'm generally skeptical and cautious. I debated if writing a post would be a terrible idea and used against me in the future--or if I'm going to be made fun of for how wishy-washy my writing is. All I know is I can not turn to the real world at this time while I'm *stuck* in a small little city of people I despise. The internet is my hope, right now, to find whoever I am looking for, even though they may not exist.\n\n   \nI'm looking for friends, (preferably my age, but ah, I know that is a lot to ask for), that intrigue me; that are smarter than me. If this is not the place to look, where can I find them?  \n\n\nI can't imagine anyone actually reading this. Let alone responding. Super let alone responding with an answer, but I'm telling myself that it's still worth a shot. ", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I moved to the US when I was 13, and just now got to move back\n\nSo: I\u2019m a feminist and a socialist. I know politics can be kind of divisive, which is fair, but my views are pretty integral to *who I am*, so I like to lay them up front. I\u2019m really into reading feminist philosophy, as well as philosophy on race, justice, and epistemology. \n\nI enjoy science fiction and fantasy, but I don\u2019t really see it as \u2018escapist\u2019. I really value writers like Ellison, Asimov, and Butler, authors that use the genre and the medium to talk about humanity, politics, and meaning. \n\nI\u2019m an artist. I mainly work with oil on canvas, but I do all sorts of stuff! My paintings tend to be macabre, as I\u2019m drawn to the intersection of sexuality and violence. I\u2019ve got plenty of normal paintings too, but I think there\u2019s a certain fascination I have with making art that honestly confronts two very powerful forces women face that may seem at odds and almost antithetical, but that often go hand in hand. \n\nAnyways, diatribes aside, and if me discussing my art hasn\u2019t scared you off (or made you think I\u2019m a future serial killer!) the last keynote I\u2019d like to touch on is that I\u2019m a trans woman. My being trans is important to me, and although I could go stealth, I think that it\u2019s vital in times such as these that us trans people stand together and say it loud and say it proud! I\u2019m happy to entertain questions about what it\u2019s like to be trans, what my personal experiences were, etc., but I absolutely ask you be respectful. I\u2019m not going to debate my identity, and if I feel like you\u2019re inviting that in any way, I\u2019m really not interested.\n\nAnyways. I think I\u2019ve written enough!

As a result, I have a degree of flexibility when it comes to choosing when I work. Unfortunately, all work and no play makes me feel restless.\n\n- I've worked on very very niche indie games before. I loved working on simple 2d games or easily moddable games and adding my own things to it. I'd like to pick this up again some day but I wouldn't be comfortable doing it without having some friends first.\n\n- I've previously expressed an interest in Dungeons &amp; Dragons. I'd love to see if I can be an effective GM. I have a wide imagination and I think I would be great at it because I can come up with stories on the spot.\n\n- I decided to move to the U.K. at the start of February this year. And start my own company at the same time. I hope that with some hard work I can get substantial rewards, though I don't want to be assimilated by the Borg.\n\n- I love to engage in deep intellectual conversations about things that interest me. I like to watch stuff that interests me. Or to play games that interest me.\n\n- Doing things that don't interest me is hard. Only a few people seem to resonate with me. A lot of people seem to have a difficult time figuring me out and/or caring about anything I have to bring to the table.\n\n- I'm trying to learn how to _listen_ instead of _engage._ I think I'm getting better at it.\n\nFeel free to message me and maybe we can get to know each other.

I recently posted about my narcissistic roommate that I have been dealing with for the past two years. In that post, I mentioned a friend that came along because she also hated my roommate. This story is about my friend.\n\nThis girl and I didn't get a chance to be friends even though we \"knew of\" each other since freshman year. She thought I was intimidating because I had a large group of friends and she didn't (which wasn't the case at all, I was just friendly with everyone and anyone). ANYWAYS, when my roommate and I started having conflicts, this girl and I got a little close because she shared with me some stuff that my roommate had said about me to her, and likewise - my roommate had said stuff about her to me. We grew way too close way too fast, and I wasn't mad about it because we got along fine.\n\nMonths passed by, and she decided to literally become my best friend, and I started seeing the clingy side of her. I've always had to deal with clingy friends my entire college life (idk why) and I wasn't about it. I still never expressed it to her that she seemed clingy with me. I wasn't really getting along with my roommate and my apartment always gave me negative vibes so I would spend most of my time at her place. She never did mind me, and I thought we had a mutual understanding about it.\n\nRecently, she started dating this guy (it's been about a month or so) and this guy seemed okay to me at first, but now I really don't like him. Not out of jealousy or anything, he's just a dick. I didn't realize that at first because I only met him after they started dating and they're also in a long distance relationship. He comes over once in a while and I don't really deal with him, but I just feel bad for this girl. Since recent, he's been controlling everything she does and says. SHe has to think twice before she says something, and he has a problem with everything. He literally gets jealous of me - ME. I'm a girl and NOT lesbian/bi and he gets jealous that I stay over at her place sometimes. He wants her to himself, and literally can't stand anyone coming over to her apartment. She's a sweet person, and she's caring, but I feel like she has this vulnerable side to her that she doesn't like showing but it comes out at times. This guy has been literally controlling her every second of the day, and wants to know every second of the day, where she is, who she's with, etc. He legit calls her 50 times a day, to talk about absolutely nothing. I understand the honeymoon phase in a relationship, because I've been in one for two years myself - but this was something else. Now, I felt something was off about this guy the first time I met him. He was trying too hard to seem like this cool person in front of us, and I just felt a little weird about it. I never said anything though, cause it wasn't my business at the time.\n\nHe came over to her place two days ago, and literally I heard him body-shame her over the phone and asking her why she didn't go to the gym. She said \"it's my choice\" bluntly, and he got mad at her! He called back and started yelling at her for saying that, and she was on the verge of crying. In my opinion, as a strong, independent woman, you can't let a man tell you what to do. Actually, you can't let anyone tell you what to do, and I'm so against guys who body-shame their girlfriends and talk shit to make themselves feel better and to make the girls feel insecure. Her roommate was having her best friend over the next day, and he got mad at his gf as if no one else can enter the apartment while he's there. I was there the night he arrived, and he literally wanted me out of the apartment as soon as possible, and I could tell just by his body language. I just don't like the way he treats her, and it concerns me for her future with him. She knows deep inside that what he's doing is wrong, but every time she still gets defensive over him. I get it, it's the attraction and honeymoon phase where no matter what the other person says or does, seems right.\n\nNow, my problem is - she doesn't realize what kind of an insecure asshole he himself is, and I can see right through him. If I tell her as a good friend, for her own safety and well-being, this, she would definitely take it either ways - that I'm trying to drive a wedge between their relationship because I'm (jealous?) or idk what, or she's going to listen to me. But I think she will defend him and think I'm just doing it because I'm not happy for her. As a third person who's been through stuff like this and dealt with guys like this before, I know exactly the kind of an asshole he is. She hasn't been in any relationships before, and this is her first. Not that she can't find her perfect fit the first time around, but just that I don't know how to explain to her (or if I should even bother telling her) about what kind of a twat he is. I do really care for her, even though she's a little clingy sometimes, I know she has my best interests in her heart. I couldn't live with myself if I knew what kind of a person she's with, and later on she get hurt and I say \"I knew this was coming all along.\" I feel like that's not a sign of a good friend. I just need advice on if I should tell her about him or not, because she's head over heels in love with him.\n\nPLEASE HELP?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I live a pretty boring and routine life. I never have drama or anything so I think that if I can help someone shoulder a burden or be a sounding board then why shouldn\u2019t I. Honestly most of the time I\u2019ve had people with relationship issues so I\u2019m pretty used to that topic but I\u2019ll talk about whatever. I don\u2019t care who you are honestly. Not in a mean way but I\u2019ll talk to whoever needs someone to talk to. \n\nI tend to connect better with people around my age (I\u2019m a 25 m) but if you\u2019re younger or older I\u2019m willing to listen. Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out if you need someone to talk to :). ", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Interests are writing, comedy, comics, movies, discussing current events, music, you know the usual stuff. I'm stuck in a rut at the moment and I just need someone new to help break that up.

Self-analysing has always turned out badly for me and I don't have the confidence to call up a doctor and such. I'm hoping to find some people who wanna talk about some serious stuff maybe just shed some perspective on my situation. If you aren't inclined I'm also fine with some shetty jokes. I'd love to talk to girls and guys of any age. (BTW if it isn't clear I'm male but I'm connecting a lot of anxiety to the fact that maybe I'd be more comfortable in a female body).
