I am a massive gamer, specifically RPG's and survival games. I have been playing an awful lot of Risk of Rain 2 as of posting this. I can not seem to stop playing it\n\n- I am extremely funny, which might sound arrogant, and I suppose in a way it is but I am only good at about three things so I like to be proud of what I have. I have a dry, sarcastic wit, and I speak in the same monotone for everything so people often struggle to tell if I am kidding or not (as do I honestly)\n\n- I love food. More the eating and less the cooking, but I am a pretty mean cook. My parents instilled cooking into me when I was young, and although most of the time I am too lazy to make proper meals, I can whip something up if I wish. \n\n- I have quite severe depression, which was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It's not a huge part of my identity or personality, but it is there in a way. I'm not necessarily suicidal, but I can take it leave living most of the time. \n\n- I am a huge weeb. I love anime and mange probably too much, but here we are. I'm still dealing with the fact that\u00a0Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen has ended. I am also so hype for the Made in Abyss movie, and the next two parts of Heavens Feel.\n\n- I am honestly not looking for a relationship. I don't really know who I am most of the time, and I am not exactly a catch, so I tend to shy away from passion and romance. Which is pretty ironic as my favourite genre of film and television is romance. \n\nI can think of more, but this post is already too large and obnoxious as it is.

Truth be told a lot of my friends are either busy or aren't really around anymore, so I've felt kind of lonely as of late. I'd like to make some new friends, preferably long-term, that I could feel close with &amp; talk to about anything. \n\nTo be honest I think I'm a pretty decent conversationalist, willing to talk about anything, and am \\*usually\\* very open and honest with the people around me. Really, you can ask me almost anything and it won't bother me. Whether you're up for a darker conversation, or just need to vent, I'd love to listen. I'm a little shy at first, but after I warm up to someone I'm usually the exact opposite -- truth be told I can sometimes be a little too chatty as I love to have long and in-depth conversations, but if that's not your cup of tea just let me know.\n\nAnyway, I'm currently in my last year and half of college and moving into a dorm next week (living with roommates should be... interesting, how have any of your experiences with roommates been?), a very big fan of video games/e-sports, anime (though I haven't watched as much recently), movies, TV Shows (just got into Love, Death, &amp; Robots and Black Mirror and have loved both) and just about everything else people on this sub seem to enjoy. I'm also learning how to cook and starting to get into make-up and the like, but I'd consider myself very, very new to both. :p\n\nAlso I don't mean to be rude, but I'm really not looking for acquaintances that I'd talk to once in a blue moon, or people who tend to respond with one or two word answers. I'm sorry if that seems petty, but I just feel like we won't really click if that's the case. Alongside that I obviously am not interested in speaking with anyone who is blatantly racist/sexist/anti-LGBTQ+, etc.\n\nI think I'll leave it at that so I don't bore anyone any more with this rather dull introduction as I'm really, really bad at these.

There is a close group of 4 of us, me, her, and two others, (F15) and (M15)- Her boyfriend isn\u2019t friends with us. \n\nA little bit of background on this friendship. We became close at the beginning of last school year, but have had some problems since then, but we\u2019ve been able to overcome them. She is very important to me, and has taught me so much about being a good person, helping others, and I have grown so much since I\u2019ve known her. She\u2019s so important to me, and I don\u2019t think I can imagine surviving school without her. \n\nShe started dating her boyfriend about 5 months ago. They\u2019ve had a lot of problems, (him cheating, her having to be suspicious, freaking out, breakdowns, etc), and through all that I have helped her through, but it led me and my other 2 friends in our close group to not like him. I believe that she deserves better, but right now they are in a good place and I know that he makes her really happy. \n\nWe started having problems a month and a half ago. In the beginning, we were only worried about her. She is fragile, and he isn\u2019t very stable, and we were worried that she was beginning to put all of her emotional support in him. If something ended badly, we were worried something bad could happen. It was all out of love. We attempted to sit down and talk to her about the situation, but she refused to listen and thought we weren\u2019t able to \u201cShare her,\u201d with him. \n\nRecently, the problems have gotten worse. It hurts to be around her. I feel like whenever she is with me she would rather be with him. She never gets off her phone, and hardly smiles around me, only acting tired. She is picking at all my insecurities, making me feel like she hangs out with me out of pity, and like our friendship isn\u2019t important to her. Recently, an important thing happened to her, and she didn\u2019t bother telling me, despite having TONS of chances. It just makes me feel like she doesn\u2019t care about me, and I can barely stand to spend time with her without breaking down. \n\nI used to think that our problems were caused by her boyfriend, but I realized that she is the real problem. She doesn\u2019t listen to what we say are our problems, and thinks that we are jealous and immature. In all of our problems, she only focuses on her perspective, without even considering that other people could be hurting from this. My other friends and I have seemingly tried everything, from sitting and talking, avoiding the problem, attempting to become friends with her boyfriend, leaving space, etc, but I realized that the problem is that she is putting no effort into fixing anything (From changing her behavior to talking to him about how he acts towards us etc). I understand that it is her life and her relationship, but other people are wrapped up in her life too. \n\nAny Advice would be helpful. ", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Funny thing is I need to vent about her\u2026 \n\nMe and this girl have been such close friends since the sixth grade. We have been through so much and have told each other everything. I have told her things I can\u2019t even admit to myself and my deepest darkest secret. On top of that she is a kind hearted person that can always make not only me, but anyone laugh. She also allowed me to meet my 2 other supper close friends and without all three of them I don\u2019t know if I could function at life. I love them to death and would do anything for them!  \n \n\nShe has gone through some struggles involving her mental health and it scares me. I know she is still struggling with it even though she tries to hide it. (important for later on)\n\nShe started dating this guy (M15) that she had a crush on since grade 8. He has done some pretty shitty things to girls before they started dating and we told her it wasn\u2019t the best idea to go through with it. But now they have been dating for I think 7 months. During the beginning he cheated on her, did some shady stuff, and overall was not a great influence on her. We told her again that we think that she should end it, and the signs were very clear. She still didn\u2019t being blinded by love and all. \n\nIt\u2019s been a couple months since then and he\u2019s been good. Other than the fact that he hates the three of us because we told them to break up, which honestly, I\u2019m fine with I never really liked him so.  \n\nThe real problem is that she is using him as an emotional crutch. Says she\u2019s only happy with him. And when she\u2019s not she\u2019s sad and can\u2019t think straight. As her friend this terrifies me because it\u2019s a high school relationship (meaning it\u2019s going to end at some point) and looking back at his history I don\u2019t think well. The three of us try not to say anything but it causes us (mostly two of us) to be very sarcastic and petty about the situation. This puts even more of a strain on the friendship. So, we decide we should bring it up to her. When we did she is always is avoiding the topic and trying to get off track. \n\nSo, this just makes everything worse and does nothing other than make her think we want them to break up. That wasn\u2019t our goal this time. We know he makes her happy that\u2019s all we want. We told her multiple times \u201cwe don\u2019t want you to break up with him we just want you to be careful\u201d. Now there is a huge strain in the friendship, and we don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nSorry this was so long, but any advice would really help.  ", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

You know, the kind liable to ask how your day is going out of the middle of nowhere and with whom you can exchange songs, dumb memes and deep discussions. Sometimes all at once. \n\nSo if you are looking for the same thing, keep reading!\n\n\nHowever..\n\n*If you are someone who is not going to bother reading the following wall, I encourage you to click the lil' X on top of this tab now. Thank you!* :) \n\n\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info (AKA full autobiography) about me:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate.\n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned career, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, which I am dealing with as best as I can - although recently, things have been on the mend - enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n- Chronically single, not that it is pertinent (After all, this is not r/r4r, unless it is - but *no* - I do not want your wiener and / or boob pictures, unless it is a wiener dog or a .. boob snake(?)).\n\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am somewhat stigmatized against the latter by some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not, in fact, a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandise and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed. \n\n- Gainfully *un*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work.\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Automata, WoW, Bioshock series, Prey, Metal Gear Solid, the &gt;Observer_, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. \nHonestly, for whatever reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nPlaying a fuck tonne of Space-Station 13, having seen [Sseth's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URJ_qSXruW0) on this marvelously-autistic game. \nFor example, in one of today's rounds I was a chef's assistant. Both me and the Head Chef were taken over by the Hive Mind (like about half of the station).. and we proceeded to murder a random assistant who was ordered to help us feed the people - because he was not part of the Hive Mind, but more importantly because the *fucker took my knife when I was not looking and cooked it in the deep-frier.* \nAnd then we made pepperoni out of it, which went straight onto a pizza, used to cook out Hive Mind comrades. \n\n\nIn other words, it is one giant clustefuck.\n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favourite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favourite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loathe cheap jumpscares they are so enamoured with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n\n- My sense of humour is possibly the worst, and I take pride in having offensive memes for every occasion ready. Needless to say, I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile stuff. \n\n- My main hobby right now is Airsoft. I spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together since I ordered most of my gear from companies in Russia. \nThe centrepiece of my collection is my plate carrier which came with full kevlar inserts and was used by Russian anti-insurgency ops. \n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I think it is time to give up trying to categorize what I like by genre, and instead do it by what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord) I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n\nSome of my favourite bands are Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Muse, Green Day, Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, NIN and many, many more - if it is not obvious by this point, I am so edgy that I (used to) cut myself :D\n\n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%, due to a certain affinity for slithering neck-ties and positive human qualities like ambition, narcissism and general douchebaggery :D \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. Stuf like lack o punctuatuion impropar gramar to short n generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit.\n\nAgain, rephrasing the last part for dozens of people who simply don't get it: *you now know a certain amount about myself. After reading your message, I should be able to know a certain amount about you - not asking for something as in depth as here, but the \"Hello my name is X I am from Y and I like Z\" is not good enough.*\n\nAlso, here are some pictures of [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0), because why not? \n\n *Please, PMs only*! I loath Reddit Chat UI. I would prefer to talk here for the first while as compared to going over to certain apps whose names trigger bots.. \n\nFeel free to hit me with your favourite ice breaker / shower question! (As long as it is not a Trotsky ice pick). \n\n\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Through the first 1,5 years, this girl (I'll refer to her as NK) and I were in a group of five friends, but we were still close. the group with the four other people sort of fell apart because two of the girls were a bit toxic and selfish, and it resulted in the remaining three (me, NK and another girl I'm still really close with) becoming a lot clsoer.\n\n\nThrough the last 1,5 years of school, NK and I grew closer and closer and we started calling each other our best friends. We did a lot of stuff together and told each other everything.\n\nWhen school ended, we partied a lot and we were together all the time. We took a lot of long walks and talked about everything, how she felt, how I felt, what we were going to do after and so on. We really got deep and I loved every second of it because I felt like I had gotten a friend for life.\n\n\nAfter a week, I went on vacation with my family. The first few days we texted a lot, but after a couple of days she grew distant. I didn't really read all that much into it, but after it went on for over a week, I asked if we should set a date to meet when I got home - I thought meeting her face to face would help figure out what was going on. She didn't want to set a date and it was a bit weird. Her answers kept getting shorter and I grew frustrated.\n\n\nOn a bit of a sidenote, during my vacation, I found out I had gotten into my dream school on my dream education. I was so happy and texted her that I got in (it had been my dream since before I met her, so she knew how much it meant to me), but she ignored me. No \"Congrats!\" or anything. That bugged me a lot.\n\n\nWhen I got home, I tried setting another date with her. This time she agreed, but when we met up, she was cold and cut the walk short. I was getting really frustrated and sad about it, so I sat down and wrote a long message to her about how I really appreciated our friendship but could feel something was off: Did I do something? Was she okay? If not, did she need anything from me?\n\n\nShe answered back, saying that being so social had drained her and she needed some time to get back to her usual self. I understood and thought that would be the end of it. I texted back, saying that I would give her some space and she could get back to me when she felt more herself.\n\n\nOnly she never did get back to me. I tried a couple of times after about two weeks, but she was distant and shut me down.\n\nThe funny thing, the thing that really hurt me, was that she seemed to spend a lot of time with our other mutual friends. I didn't understand at all.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen the girls from our class got together, we were both there, and when we said hi, she was really sweet and happy. \"It's been so long, how come we haven't gotten together? I miss you!\" she said. That threw me off, because I had definitely tried to get together.\n\n\nWell, I tried to text her after that, asking if she wanted to hang out, because she clearly said so last time we saw each other. But no, she said she still wasn't up for being social with anyone. Still she kept hanging out with other mutual friends. We agreed that when she was ready, she would reach out to me. Again, she never did.\n\n\nI can take a hint at this point and decided that I wouldn't pursue the friendship any further. She had hurt me a lot during these months and she obviosly didn't care about how I felt. It was a difficult time for me, but I didn't reach out to her.\n\n\nWe sometimes saw each other when the girls met up and she acted like she did the first time, all happy and like we were besties. It annoyed the crap out of me, to be honest.\n\n\nNow I though I had gotten over it, seeing as I hadn't seen her in a while, but a few weeks ago I met up with a mutual friend of ours and she asked me why I had given up my friendship with NK? She missed me a lot and was miserable that I had decided my new school friends were better than her and that I didn't have time for her anymore.\n\n\nThat surprised and annoyed me. I have in no way chosen my new friends over her, until I gave up on her, and she has in no way tried to reach out. Yet she makes me out to be the bad guy here.\n\n\nSorry for the long, long post.\u00a0\n\n\nTl;dr - former best friend ghosted me (in a weird way) but tells mutual friends that I was the asshole.\n\n\nDo any of you have experience with this?

For the most part, I posted. Some of my posts became pretty popular, but I've deleted them since. Being a girl definitely helped me get more attention and there's no way I can pretend that's not the case. I replied to just about every person who messaged me, often forgoing sleep just to feel like I was being nice to the person on the other screen.\n\nI met someone on here and we ended up falling for each other. We dated for a couple months. Shortly after we split up he ghosted me. It hurt me deeply and made me stop and think if I was doing this to others too. I then decided to start telling people when I wasn't interested in continuing a conversation. I was intimidated at first, but surprisingly, when you're polite and have good intentions most people don't hate your guts. A lot of them were kind of grateful that I was being sincere instead of leaving them to piece the puzzle for themselves.\n\nThe ghosting mindset is deeply ingrained in this subreddit, but it's one of many things. Something else I noticed is people posting when they're in a bad state of mind. Having friends can help, but it isn't a cure-all. The problems often run deeper than that. On top of that, looking for friends only when you're in need shows a lack of respect and compassion for others as well as yourself. I want to be friends with someone who likes me. Not because I'm some quick fix and make them feel better.\n\nThen there's the plethora of responses girls get after making a post vs. guys. It's unfair, yes, but I don't think we would have it any other way. We complain about the injustice, but take no action to change it. The problem here is we only talk to people we can see ourselves dating. It's nice to date someone you're close with, but this isn't the right place. If you're replying to people who fit your requirements for a potential partner, fuck you. Fuck you and your ulterior motives.\n\nMany of you are nice and well-intentioned, but in all my time here, I've only become friends with one person. And that's after a whole lot of time, effort, and searching. I've clicked with many, but most people simply don't want to truly commit or reciprocate. It's the sad truth. The friend I mentioned recently suggested I stop posting altogether and just reply to your guys' posts. It seemed like a good idea, so I gave it a fair shot. I think I can honestly say that at this point, nothing is different. The problems are still the same. You ghost. You cry for help. You make passes when you know full well that's not what I'm looking for. There is a complete disconnect between what this sub wants to be and what it is.\n\nI'll probably delete this account later. It's been a learning experience, but it's better to let it go now. I tried. From one hopeful person to another, good luck. Not sure if you'll find it here.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Recently (I'm a sophomore) this has started to make me pretty clingy because  I feel like I need to make up for lost time before I leave for college, but nobody seems to want anything to do with me. But at the beginning of this year I found a few people that acted as though they really wanted to be my friends. They invited me to a few parties in October and November (I hadn't been to a party in about a decade at this point), but for the past couple months I feel like I've been set aside. They don't text me as often, I haven't done anything with them outside or inside of school in months, and I often see parties and events that I haven't even heard of popping up on their Snapchat stories, often with people they have told me they don't like being around. I don't know where I was on the friend scale for that period of time but now I definitely feel lower down. I've tried talking to them about it, but they ended up getting mad at me for something or other I must have said. We're \"ok\" now but I still don't feel like much has changed in that regard and I'm really hesitant to bring it back up. What do I do? Outside of school they don't respond to my texts for hours at a time, and inside of school I'm too afraid to say anything to them in case I make them all angry again. I've heard a lot of people tell me \"find new friends\" but, first of all, I really like who these people are, they're good people, it's the fact that I've been sort of shunned that I have a problem, and secondly, I go to a very small school (&lt;300 total enrolment in the highschool) so it's not like there's a whole lot to choose from.

I guess this is an update on my old \nr/suicidewatch post... Suffice to say I was in a bad place then.\n\nAnyhow, Tom and I have been friends for years, since my senior at school, which makes it over 3 years ago... I don't have a lot of friends, and don't make connections easily...  In the end Tom was all I had. I can say I was, maybe still am depressed, and am struggling over this the most...\n\nTom's attitude towards me confuses me. Let's say lately he's been agressive, cruel even. Using his not so meager knowledge about me against me, I haven't been giving his shit much credit. I'm changing my Major, struggling with homework and College kid stuff. He's not a priority. \n\nSo lately I've been horribly busy. But usually see him as a priority, am so with my friends... after a fight over literally nothing, a fight I ended because I was busy on a political matter that couldn't get out of. Also I had failed Econ, again, and didn't feel like talking or fighting. He's been very resentful since.\n\nThat day he accused me of selfishness, I am always inviting him to do stuff and share a lot of my things with him; hence the accusation is ridiculous, he has been very selfish with me, beforehand... putting his needs before mine and being a hot head, and a pain... That fight ended. I went to sleep, annoyed. \n\nCome 1AM and come a lot of selfhating messages about how he brings only pain and hurts others... between them people who've hurt me. The next day I wake up and see them and am lost with how to respond, but he insists that I answer him. So I remark he's hurt some people that have hurt me and that I might just thank him for that...\n\nIt was, apparently, not what he wanted to hear. He accuses me of selfishness again, and I've just had it. I give him examples of times I opened up to his friends, how they hurt me; and did stuff he wanted... he keeps saying everything's about me. His anger goes into attention he says he hates touching and I know it but I insist into hugging him and keeping him close... so, sorry if I didn't want you sitting on the bed with shoes on. Not. And then says I am needy, that I require too much attention, and he doesn't wanna spend all day dealing with me.\n\nFrustrated I tell him he'll never have to. And just uninstall WhatsApp on the spot. Two day's later I have to join a group for college in WhatsApp, I have to download the dammed app again. And silence since then, I get ever more frustrated, hurt and angry. So I get a little tipsy and ramble on the Status feature (Screw that fucking feature) saying people are selfish and cruel. \n\nHe responds with a poem. One about a poisonous bird who destroys everything... Finally I've had it and I apologize for whatever it is I did. I just don't want to argue anymore... pride gets in the way of everything... so I ignore my pride and talk to my friend. Send him a text. Asking to talk. He says he DOESN'T apologize, that he hurts people and he's gonna like doing it... He shows the poem again, I make a poem on the spot trying to get him to stop his hatred. He keeps insulting. Saying he is superior and basically my worst nightmare. I try to get through to him emotionally, but he pushes me away. Saying am not his friend.\n\nInstead of angry, I get concerned. But he keeps pushing me away. After a rather impetuous remark, I simply turn his game around on his ass and remind him that I have a genius IQ. I am not a bragger but him downputting me because of his hatred annoys me. And I use to study psych, so I am trying to disbalance him, that's all.\n\nHe starts to brag that he's gonna be rich and mean and cool. And am like, \"Am I talking to a 12 year old?\" I tell him he's not rich and he cannot buy the things that matter, or the intelligence. \n\nHe says he'll hire someone smarter than me and not so \"dependent\". I tell him, he's been ridiculous and I am disgusted and disappointed with his attitude. He goes back calling me on depression and saying how he's gonna beat me...\n\nI manage to get him to speak of his ideals. And eventually ask why he's so hateful, and I get \"myself\" as response. I ask why, what had happened? Answer is: \"None of your business.\" I tell him am still he's friend. No answer. \n\nI roll my eyes and go into Reddit. Post n1. About all of this. Get some good advice, (Thanks, Toby) and decide to keep my distance and let it blow over. I see a suicidal girl, and I feel like I can help, so I try, I hope she's doing well... And so I start doing it with other people. Helping them as much as I can... Feeling am doing some good, I feel stronger about myself... I remark about it on my status...\n\nTom sends me an answer. \"How Pathetic can you be?\" I find it sad and selfish that he'd think that way... I tell him off. \n\nHe says he's full of joy. And I'm depressed and asks who's pathetic of the two. I sidestep every attack he sends my way. Not giving him ground. Eventually he tells me he's found a target, someone I can help. A girl in his college who never changed passwords and that he's gonna ruin her life. \n\nThough maybe I feel a bit of concern. I tell him I don't care. He insists on it and I insist his cruel acts don't concern me. That am helping people, he can shove it, and am busy and have a meeting with a teacher. He tells me to \"break a leg... no, actually break emotionally!\" I say that \"As long as you treat me horribly. You are not a priority. You are just a disappointment.\"\n\nHe says he's bored of me and am \"Tedious \ud83d\ude44\" And then he says he's gonna hurt that girl. I tell him to do whatever he wants, I don't care. He says \"I'm planning to...\" I ignore him. Later on I get in WhatsApp, he's erased the part about the girl... I raise my eyebrows... all of it, he erased it. \n\nMy first thought is that if I am so clingy and he cannot deal with me, why is he talking to me? Then he says he wants to hurt me. But I take that away from him. He leaves. Doesn't tell anyone else how he's feeling. And I am confused. 7 semester's of psych is not enough to understand... He is running hot n cold, in an aggressive way...\n\nI know this argument paints him in a horrible light. He's a WONDERFUL friend... thoughtful and concerned. My depression hasn't been easy on him... and he's lashing out. \n\nSo this has me frowning in confusion at various points of the day. I'm still talking to people in r/suicidewatch I had the psych training and am depressed, so I think I can maybe help... and I keep trying no matter what anyone says... or what happens. I've actually seemed to have helped some people... and I'm glad to see it... I know I can't help everyone... but I'll help as much as I can...\n\nTommy hasn't blocked me. I see him online occasionally. Very rarely. I have other concerns. So I am waiting it out. But I have no idea what to think... I am planning to just drop WhatsApp on the summer, unless he remembers I care about him and talks to me... or some friends fall suddenly from the sky and convince otherwise. I don't like the app and have no one to talk to but him.\n\nNot leaving Reddit though... I don't know what Thomas will do... or how he feels. \n\nHe never left my side in my worst times, so if your advice is forget about him, thanks, but I am not gonna. I just wanna know what's going on that head of his, and if anyone has previous experience... and please don't flame him. If anything I know he's hurting and doesn't deserve it... Also, don't go too much into diagnosis if you can manage... it's really hard to do it... I know it.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I am socially anxious even online, so when I play this MMO, I tend to play solo. Recently though, I found someone who I really like and feels really comfortable with. To my delightful surprise, she also seems to like hanging out with me.\n\nA few weeks ago, she stopped inviting me to runs and rarely chats with me in game. I know for a fact she does run stuff, but I am excluded. I noticed she always run with a particular player, and suddenly has a new group of friends. This correlates with the time she stopped inviting me to runs. In other words, she found new people to hang out with and I am being replaced.\n\nI am in her discord group so whenever I see her talking about running stuff, without me, I feel really hurt. I left the discord after I decided it's not good for my mental health (I may or may not have depression). On that same day, she messaged me in game but she didn't realized I left the discord group so I told her. And then I told her everything. She said she agreed with how she seem to forgot about me and will try not to make me feel left out again.\n\nThe next day she invited me to a run like old times but today while wandering in game I found she always hang with her new friends. Realization that she literally hangs with them every day hits me and I feel extremely jealous. I became a mess in real life. I realized now that even if she included me again it's probably just out of pity and I can never be on par with her new friends.\n\nI know some of you will probably be thinking \"it's just an online friend\" but my online life is literally 90% of my life and I really don't know how to cope with it, especially since I went through a similar experience in real life in regards to my college friends (we didn't talk anymore).

After getting to know me more he became quit comfortable with me. Then embarrassingly admired he once liked me and eventhjnks I got so much attention in school because I was pretty. I thought it because I was a freak like the clown type. I still don\u2019t feel pretty no matter who tells me I am. I grew up feeling bullied and ugly\n\nAnyway the thing got sexual. The kid grew up being bullied and had no friends right. So he\u2019s always lonely and willing to chat. Most of the people he gets along with are girls. And a lot of them are really s e x crazed. They send him pics of their lingerie, them self pleasuring, them self pleasuring in public. And asking for advice. I was like what the fk. I\u2019ve always been friends with good smart FUNNY girls. No one in my school did that stuff... openly. Anyway he inspired me to want to get some thong underwear , and maybe even try taking the risk of self pleasure in public. I admit even though I\u2019m good I\u2019ve been a self pleasure and p o r n freak. I don\u2019t want to sleep around though. I want the perfect guy. And this guy has the same mindset.

He\u2019s helped me change my mindset on bad boys and guys to stay away from since he knew so many. Ok anyway he wants pics of me in my new lingerie, esp the pink one. And snap of me doing myself in public if I ever decide to. I\u2019ve considered it, but I have so much class and self respect not Wanting to send it is outweighing wanting to send it. I won\u2019t send him my body. Anyway what do u think he\u2019s trying to do? He told me he doesn\u2019t think anything sexual. He just wants to help me feel hot and sexy.

This was the start of the end...\n\nTo be honest, maybe I should have thought about it more at the time but my mum kept saying how she couldn't get to go see it because she worked when it was shown during the week and it isn't being shown after a certain date.\n\nIt's a bit far from where we live, and I hadn't seen a film with her in years, so I agreed to go, because it would make her happy and assumed my friend would understand which she kinda did?\u00bf it's all a bit confusing still...but I was like oh I'll just watch it twice I don't see the harm.\n\nWhen we were at the cinema my mum seemed really happy and it made my heart happy, so I'm not sure I entirely regret the decision. I don't get to see her much and it was nice to treat her, I think she just wanted us all to something as a family, it was sweet.\n\nAnyway I sent a text telling my best friend what was happening on the way, which maybe wasn't the best idea, having had some wines with lunch - the text might have been a bit long or soppy idk, to which she replied 'It's your choice haha'.\n\nAnyway so I come home from the film (btw I live at uni which is about 30 mins from where I'm actually from which is why the places and people clash in this story)\n\nMy best friend, who I live with, isn't really around when I get back and doesn't come into my room to ask me about my day which happens sometimes, she might have been tired I thought?\n\nSo the next day rolls around and so I thought I would head to the library early - best friend was in shower when I left\n\nSo then I get a text saying 'have you already left lol I wanted to go to library too.'\n\nTo which I honestly replied that I didn't know she wanted to come (cos sometimes she doesn't like the library!) and usually when we are at uni and going to lectures we know eachothers schedules so we don't like text eachother where we are going etc...\n\nAnyway she replied: 'you could've asked me lol' and replying to what I already had said (that I would save her a seat) she was like 'no it's fine don't want to interrupt your day lol' and I said we could grab lunch or a coffee together to which she kept saying 'no don't want to disturb you' which was a bit strange to me...\n\nThe reason I kept offering to meet in person is because I have sufferrd with anxiety and I have a tendency to hide behind my phone and it always ends up badly which ironically slapped me in the face this time.\n\nReplying to the cinema thing, she replied that she was going to go with our other flatmate and that she didn't want me to come with her just because 'i felt bad.'\n\nTo which I replied I didn't feel bad, I wanted to go with her and we had been looking forward to it and it was a commitment we had made, and that I hadn't had a chance to tell her about Mother's Day and why I ended up going, and then she was like no you don't need to explain 'i'm a big girl.'\n\nThen I was like I will explain it in person, but i said 'you don't have to listen if you don't want to', jokingly\n\nThen she replied 'you need to stop saying things like this, I'm not a monster who's going to erupt.'\n\nThis monster thing has come up before in another little argument where I stupidly text everything I wanted to say to her, but I made sure this time not to do that and I have been trying to work on communication, and I didn't avoid her on purpose I genuinely think that was misunderstood.\n\nAnyway since then she has been super distant, whenever I message her she just replied with 'nice!' Or 'yup!'\n\nIn the living room it's super awkward and whenever I try to make conversation she replied with one word answers and it's so weird not being close and just talking/laughing about everything and anything.\n\nWe went to the film yesterday night and the walk there with my flatmate she only made small talk and was very distant in general.\n\nAround the house she only says superficial hellos and makes small talk but I hear her being less distant with my other flatmate upstairs.\n\nI have made two attempts to spend time together, yesterday offering to study together and today I asked if she wanted to come to the library with me and she replied something along the lines of 'No, I don't want to slow you down'(?)\n\nI honestly feel like it's been a lot of misunderstanding but I feel like I'm losing my best friend and I don't really understand how his happened,\n\nWe are super close we do everything together and she is really important to me. I know I fucked up but I'm just trying to make sense of where (can anyone help?!!)\n\nI was thinking of tomorrow asking her to have a conversation about it all but I'm worried she'll tell me I'm treating her like a 'monster' again if I go to her room and get all shaky asking her (I have previously suffered from and continue to suffer from social anxiety)\n\nBut if I text her I'm worried she'll say the same thing about hiding away.\n\nWe are in final year, and we have been friends for 4 yrs including a year in different countries and with exams looming, I feel like neither of us need this stress and it's a bit ridiculous as we are both 21 y/o.\n\nBut more than that I love her and miss her and I'm truly sorry for any upset I may have caused!!\n\nI haven't approached her about talking about it yet because I wanted to give some space and see if things would return to normal but they really have stagnated, or gone stale even and there has been no thawing of her distant demeanour...\n\nPart of the issue is I don't understand this whole monster thing?? (Help)\n\nI also want to talk to her before she goes home for easter next week.\n\n(Also I'm aware she could see this but is because it's nothing I wouldn't say to her face haha)\n\nAnyway thanks for reading all this I guess, it was long and any advice I would be super grateful for!!\n\nDo I go to her room and ask her to organise a time to talk it through? Or do I message her and organise a time? Or something else?\n\nWhat should I say?? (I have a rough idea but would be helpful to hear people's suggestions)\n\nI know this probably sounds so dumb but I have several friends irl but she is my only close friend I can talk to about stuff like this so I feel really alone without her and I miss her a lot :(\n\nWhat do I do to get my best friend back?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Now she\u2019s moved onto the guy she was cheating with.  Like basically dating the other guy since sheS been with him for 6 months now.  Meanwhile in the past month, she\u2019s ditched me for the guy, ditched her friend Riley\u2019s birthday night out(and is in a big fight with her), complains about our mutual friends who she lives with, hates her boss, and isn\u2019t even happy with this Replacement boyfriend.  The worst part is that she doesn\u2019t have any goals or plan of action to improve her situation.  So I cracked.  called her it on it and was kind of harsh over text.  I told her that I can\u2019t continue to be her friend if she doesn\u2019t take action to change her situation.  I feel physically and mentally dragged down with her.  I\u2019ve been counseling her for the past 6 months trying to tell her to break up with her bf since she obviously wasn\u2019t happy.  The way I worded things when texted her could have been kinder.  Not my proudest moment.  I thought she would respond to my bomb drop of disapproval by saying something like \n\n\u201cWow you\u2019re right and I don\u2019t want to keep going down this path and I\u2019m going to make a plan and work on things\u201d \n\nand I would have been happy to help her.. but instead she completely was defensive.  Calling me a bad friend, not standing by her side, not supporting her, \nAnd said \u201cYou\u2019re not affected by my decisions, it\u2019s my life not yours, YOU DONT HAVE To FIX ME\u201d\n\nAnd basically I\u2019m like.... don\u2019t you want a friend who is trying to hold you accountable when you\u2019re going down a bad path??? Don\u2019t you think you should be alone and take time to find yourself and heal?? \n\nBut she can\u2019t be alone.  And I was dragged in the middle of all this trying to be fake supportive for the past 6 months.  \n\nWe are like sisters, going to be each others maid of honor, have literally been through hell and back.  When she\u2019s happy I\u2019m happy and when she\u2019s sad I\u2019m sad... I don\u2019t know if she genuinely feels the same way.  \n\nBut I\u2019m starting to see that she\u2019s just been selfish and self serving for all these years while I\u2019ve been continuously frustrated by her lack of drive / motivation/ doesn\u2019t try to work on herself.  Am I too critical?  Should her choices really affect me?\n\nI told her I need a break and I can\u2019t talk to her for 3 weeks.  She told me \u201cI can\u2019t keep fighting for you to want to stay friends with me\u201d and that \u201cyou make me feel like I have no good friendship qualities and that I\u2019m a terrible person not worth keeping as a friend when shit gets hard\u201d \n\nBasically here is the question:  should I walk away from this friendship or try to fix it?  \n\n\nYou can\u2019t help someone who doesn\u2019t wanna help themself.... but also.... if her choices bring negativity into my life then idk????   I can\u2019t help the desire to want to see her do better for herself.  I can\u2019t listen to her complaints and see no action for change.  It\u2019s so fucked up!!!  \n\nHELP! please!!!

I am someone who is wanting to improve on my social skills as I am someone who hasn't really gained that many and it has now became a problem in my life. I have made this post to try and find anyone who is interested to hear more about me and for anyone who wants me to try and get to know them. I have listed four things about myself to give you a few ideas of what I am like, so here goes:\n\n1. I would like to consider myself a gamer, I tend to play on Xbox One mostly, but at times I do come onto my computer and play some games on here. At the moment, I am playing Grand Theft Auto V, in between that, I play Rocket League, Minecraft and a couple of other games that peek my interest at the time.\n2. My music taste for someone my age and location does seem to shock people, this being Country music. I like the newer stuff mainly, as it has a pop sort of feel, which I like as it keeps me in a good, positive mood. I do listen to most genres though, my main being Country, but when I am bored of this, I go out of my way to try and find new artists and music. My main method for this is using Discover Weekly on Spotify each week to try and increase my music playlist.\n3. I am someone who can watch TV shows back to back, I have done this with Supernatural, Bones and at the moment, I am watching NCIS. I used to be a fan of Doctor Who, until it started going south, I still watch it when it is on out of respect. When it comes to movies, I watch a wide range, I don't have a personal favourite, but in certain genres, I do have a list of preferred ones. Feel free to bring this up if we start chatting.\n4. For those who know about the MBTI test, I am an INTJ, I am someone who is going through a few life struggles right now and trying to gain a few new friends, whether it just be one of you, or a whole bunch of people. I am someone who hasn't really grasped socialising yet, so please bare with me, I am new to all of this.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read about me, now I would love to hear a few things about you, feel free to message me on here to start a conversation and I'll be sure to message back.

This crushed him and ever since he has not treated me the same. I had another date tonight, as I feel dating and meeting new people could help me find myself. As soon as he found this out, he ghosted me. Well a few hours later I get a text saying \u201csydney.... Remington died\u201d his German Shepard was not responding and was unconscious. I asked him what happened and he said \u201cwell I\u2019ve had a crappy night and he wouldn\u2019t listen and I found out my ex (who meant the absolute world to him despite her crushing his heart) moved on. Remington took off after another dog so I got him and started kicking him until he was screaming and then I drug him by his Leash for about a hundred yards and he collapsed. I think I snapped his neck. I didn\u2019t mean to\u201d upon hearing this. I told my date I had to go and I drove out to nathan who already had the body in the bed of his truck covered with a towel. I said \u201cI can\u2019t even look at you right now. How could you ever kill your dog? I don\u2019t care if it was an accident or not! You know, he and I were always both so happy to see you. Even when Lindsey hurt you and you pushed everyone away the two of us stayed. You murdered basically a friend of mine. You are not the same. Why? Because I felt myself getting attached to you when it\u2019s so soon? Because you are such a great guy and need someone who is ready for what you want? And because some bimbo you and I both know was a curse to you broke your heart? So you get mad and beat the crap out of your German Shepard? I call bullshit. You better tell your mom the truth because if she doesn\u2019t find out I\u2019m telling her. You are not the same. Idek why I ever talked to you. Goodbye nathan. You have no dog and now you have no best friend\u201d and I walked back to my car before he could say a word. I\u2019ve blocked him and told my parents, who adored him and wanted me to give him a shot in the dating game. But now I am glad I didn\u2019t even get near him after our hookups. Now I\u2019m especially glad I wasn\u2019t the one to be victim. He killed his dog. And now from what our mutual friends are saying he keeps saying \u201cI\u2019m next\u201d so I\u2019m afraid he will end his life... what do I do? I love him (as a friend) but I can\u2019t keep doing it and refuse to go back... for a long ass time at least. But he needs help. Is there anything I can do? Even for the dog I\u2019m sure he\u2019s gonna dump off somewhere? ", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Four 4 months now Ive struggled with not being able to get out of bed in the morning, not knowing what will happen to me once I get out of high school, what my friends think of me, etc. Back in December I broke up with who I now know was the girl that I didnt deserve (Ill refer to her as E). After 3+ years of dating I just fell out of love, and instead of talking to her I pushed her away. Thats about where all of the serious depression started. Ever since then Ive been lonely, I tried to date, but one shut me down and the other is a story all on her own. The bottom line is that Ive decided to stop looking for love again because after what I did to E. Thats just one layer on the cake. 3 years ago my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. That was when I started feeling sad, but not this depressed. My dad passed away at the start of March. I thought about giving up and letting myself waste away until I had to hold my mother, brother, and sister in my arms at the funeral. Since then, nothing's the same anymore. I used to have a whole list of things that would make me happy but now I cant give someone a genuine smile if I tried. I have friends that I hang with, both online and in real life but I was feel like Im not really there. Im usually ignored, or cut off a lot, or I dont get as many laughs as everybody else does and I just dont know how many real friends I have.

So he\u2019s always lonely and willing to chat. Most of the people he gets along with are girls. And a lot of them are really s e x crazed. They send him pics of their lingerie, them self pleasuring, them self pleasuring in public. And asking for advice. I was like what the fk. I\u2019ve always been friends with good smart FUNNY girls. No one in my school did that stuff... openly. Anyway he inspired me to want to get some thong underwear , and maybe even try taking the risk of self pleasure in public.

I wrote some essays, and whenever I have an idea or something that pops in my mind I just write it down which means I have many textfiles in my computer that are waiting for me tyo finish them.\n\n\\-I like to go out either with some friend or like to walk in the city.

She seems to connect very quickly and strongly but only with a very particular type of person. Where we currently live, there seems to be some shortage of this type of person and that leads to my wife making lots of friends, but none that really stick. None that last or feel close or substantial. It's something like the difference between people you only talk to because you sit near each other at work, but if you saw them at the store you or them would not go out of your way to talk to them.   \n\n\nI have a solid, close group of friends who I talk to and hang out with on a regular basis...but she does not and it frustrates me to no end that I can do nothing to help when she feels lonely.

We went to the same elementary, but for middle school my parents choiced me into a different school, (though I'm glad they did, I love the people there, and though I had friends at my elementary school, the only one I'm hung up on is the one I'll be addressing later.) In 6th grade we texted and hung out all the time, I even went with her family to their lake cabin over the summer! In 7th grade we talked less because of homework, but we still talked and hung out at least 1-2 times each month, though some months were hectic. Then, in 8th grade, we talked some for the start of the school year. But around October/November, we stopped talking, and we haven't hung out since. We didn't get into an argument, I'm not mad at her, I don't think she's mad at me, but we haven't talked. My birthday is coming up soon, and every year for the past 3 years we've always gone to the movies on my birthday, but I don't think I'll have the time to go on the day of my b-day this year. We've always gone on the exact date. And then, I'm also planning my birthday party, but it will have all of my other friends, or possibly just like 2-4, I haven't decided, since I still have like a month. But I think that inviting her to a party with all of my other friends, who she met like once in 6th grade but they were all too shy to talk to each other, would make her feel left out.

That being said it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have friends, my friends all live in different states therefor making shit difficult but I miss having that one person nearby that I can talk to about pointless shit and just veg out and do nothing with. A lot of my friendships have ended either because they found \u201cbetter\u201d people and dropped me or because I honestly rushed into a friendship and realized that people suck. I know I do this thing where I\u2019m all into a new friendship at the beginning and then I shut down - habit considering the two most important friendships of my life up and replaced me out of nowhere so yeah i\u2019m sure i\u2019m jaded in some way. It makes me hyperaware of certain qualities that don't mesh well with me and then thats the only thing I end up focusing on. \n\nThis need to fill this void has led me to latch on to people and then once we really get to know each other they\u2019re not the people i thought they were. I\u2019m sure it goes both ways because I definitely can be a lot to handle. I\u2019m super sarcastic and that definitely can get on peoples nerves/ cause us to clash. And i\u2019ve been working on myself because I know it takes two to tango and i\u2019m sure i\u2019m part to blame when certain friendships end. Like, my biggest thing is i\u2019m so tired of ALWAYS being the one to reach out and make an effort because once I stop trying to make plans/check up on people it\u2019s radio silent. \n\nPlus working graveyard shift 5 nights a week makes it hard to have a normal life - when people I hang out with do stuff it always happens to fall on my weekends that I work which sucks. \n\nHonestly, don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard for me to find someone that\u2019s into watching crappy tv, eating good food, and just chilling.

(\uff89\u00b4\u30ee`)\uff89", "author": "OneSleepyMonkey", "self_text": "**Background for posting:** Hello there, Reddit! I've been feeling a bit lonely and keeping too much to myself lately, so I wanted to take the chance to meet some new people and expand on my support/friend group! What I'm looking for is pretty general. Long term friendship, someone that just wants to say something more than the bi-weekly \u201chey\u201d and disappear after the first month. You know, something where you spend time together occasionally, is passionate about some of the same things and/or wants to talk endlessly about a series/technique they love, sending funny videos or gifs in the middle of the night, and just having a generally good time! Maybe we'll even become close friends, you never know. Sorry ahead of time for this book of a post. o-o;\n\nI'm usually on the computer since my hobbies are all based at home, so I'm usually doing something involving... \n \n* **Games:** I play a lot of games, it's usually my go-to way to pass the time unless something just doesn't sound interesting to me or there's a new video out. My taste in games tend to vary wildly, I don't think there's a genre I haven't played at least once and I love to talk about a game's story, art, or gameplay style... or just mindlessly play fun co-op games. Recent games I've played/completed (usually on PS4, but I do have a PC and PS3) include: Danganronpa 1&amp;2, GTA V (PS4/PC), Red Dead Redemption (PS4), Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne (PS4), Digimon World: Next Order, Undertale, Monster Hunter World (PS4), Jackbox Party Pack, Tabletop Simulator, DMC 5, and Persona 5.\n\n* **Animation:** I love all things animation, I watch everything from 2D sprites to 3D models, animated movies to animations on YT, and anime to cartoons. I'm not as against live action, but I can never keep up with the newest thing on Netflix. Things I've recently watched/am into are Steven Universe, Little Witch Academia, Wolf Children, No Game No Life, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Toradora, and various Youtube fanimations/projects. And some other non-animation youtube creators (Two best friends play (rip), Redlettermedia, Rebeltaxi/panpizza etc etc)\n\n* **Doodling/Animating/Writing:** Something I've been working on for a bit now. Drawing has definitely overtaken my writing side but still interested in it. I'm not particularly good at it yet (having started from scratch a few years ago), but I'd like to get good enough to be able to do fun little webcomics, animatics, or storyboards for my own enjoyment. It's not much but maybe someone will find it interesting or can relate.\n\n* **Horror:** a relatively newer hobby. I've been part of a horror group that streams on rabbit and I've learned to love all the intrigue and cheese that comes with it. I'm usually into the trashier and cheesier stuff but they have streamed classics, Italian horror, and newer releases. It'd be fun to have someone to talk to about that or wanted to watch things with. (message me if you're interested in joining that group too and have a skype) \n\n**Personality:** INFJ, for anyone who wants to know that. To be completely honest... I wouldn't really know how to describe myself. I just hope some of it came through in this post. I'm kinda bubbly, I think I've toned down quite a bit from when I was younger but I still think I might turn people away with my bursts of randomness. I'm also a bit shy and probably have a little bit of social anxiety but I do love talking on audio calls while playing/watching things over Skype/Discord/Rabbit through screenshare (You know, if it gets to that point). Generally I tend to open up to women more, because of bad experiences with guy friends (but would like to stress that I'm only looking for a platonic friendship. I honestly don't think I'm the right place for a relationship anyway. :T ). Though, I wouldn't be opposed to trying another guy friend. :o Also, I tend to really invest myself into someone once I get to really like them and get discouraged if they stop talking completely or do something to hurt me. It's part of the reason why this post is so long, so you know exactly what you're getting and to see if you'd like to genuinely go after that. :D\n\n**tl;dr:** I understand this post is kind of a mess, but thanks for trying anyway. I'm kinda shy, sort of bubbly, and generally nice guy who's into gaming, animation of all types, drawing, animating, and a lot of random videos on YouTube (generally going to let's play, gaming, animation, and animals) who's looking for a long term friendship.\n\n**Side note:** I would like to talk a bit on Reddit before taking things to Skype, Discord, or whatever. It's nothing personal, It's just that I would like to get to know someone before they have instant access to me all the time and am at least 50% sure you won't just disappear after the first week. This is also my last time posting this sort of post for a while (at least on this subreddit, maybe post again a year later), So feel free to message me if you're interested at all! :D", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

So, I'm a 33 year old female. I work in a body shop and have been there for about four years.\n\nWe used to have a very tight team of people who were all really close with each other, to the point we referred to ourselves as a family. In the past six months, a lot of things have changed with the team. A bunch of people are gone now, and to be honest it really doesn't feel the same anymore. I don't have a close connection with the new team members; we still get along fine, it's just not that same vibe we had before which is fine.\n\nAnyways, I have been going through a lot of health related issues recently. Most recently, I had what I feared was a melanoma and had a punch biopsy done on Thursday this week. I probably shouldn't have gone to work on Friday,I felt really terrible from the biopsy. I was dizzy, losing my balance all day and nauseous and in a lot of pain.\n\nMy boss decided to buy the whole shop lunch on Friday, we were all supposed to sit together but as I was feeling ill, I didn't want to join them and decided to stay back by myself. Two of my closest friends in the shop decided to keep me company and we ate the three of us together.\n\nNow, in the afternoon on Friday after everyone had lunch together, another one of my co workers who had sat with the rest of the group at lunch, came to talk to me. He told me that everyone was talking sh*t about me, even my boss and that my boss was mad at me about it... In the afternoon my boss came to give us our pay stubs and wouldn't even look me in the eyes let alone talk to me..\n\nSo now, I am going to be off work for a month after a surgery I'm having in two weeks, and I can't help but feel like everyone is kicking me when I'm down...I feel like it's really mean that they were talking about me when I was really sick from having a biopsy that previous day. Now I'm going to be off for an entire month, and I don't even know if I want to come back after. \n\nWhat should I do here? I feel like it's really awkward now and feel like I know what people really think about me now, I'm hurt that they would talk like this about me behind my back when I'm going through such terrible experiences...I feel like I don't belong anymore.

You know, the kind liable to ask how your day is going out of the middle of nowhere and with whom you can exchange songs, dumb memes and deep discussions. Sometimes all at once. \n\nSo if you are looking for the same thing, keep reading!\n\nHowever..\n*If you are someone who is not going to bother reading the following wall, I encourage you to click the lil' X on top of this tab now. Thank you!* :) \n\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info (AKA full autobiography) about me:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate. In the process of joining CAF\u2019s reserves as Infantry.\n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned careers, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics. At least, in regards to most topics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, which I am dealing with as best as I can - although recently, things have been on the mend - enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n- Chronically single, not that it is pertinent (After all, this is not r/r4r, unless it is - but *no* - I do not want your wiener and / or boob pictures, unless it is a wiener dog or a .. boob snake(?)).\n\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am somewhat stigmatized against the latter by some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not, in fact, a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandise and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed. \n\n- Gainfully *un*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work. Also trying to get a job as a security guard.\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Automata, WoW, Bioshock series, Prey, Metal Gear Solid, the &gt;Observer_, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. \nHonestly, for whatever reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nPlaying a fuck tonne of Space-Station 13, having seen [Sseth's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URJ_qSXruW0) on this marvelously-autistic game. \nFor example, in one of my favourite rounds I was a chef's assistant. Both me and the Head Chef were taken over by the Hive Mind (like about half of the station).. and we proceeded to murder a random assistant who was ordered to help us feed the people - because he was not part of the Hive Mind, but more importantly because the *fucker took my knife when I was not looking and cooked it in the deep-frier.* \nAnd then we made pepperoni out of it, which went straight onto a pizza, used to cook out Hive Mind comrades. \n\n\nIn other words, it is one giant clustefuck.\n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favourite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \nAlso just re-started Futurama after finishing season 7. Woo.\n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favourite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loathe cheap jumpscares they are so enamoured with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n\n- My sense of humour is possibly the worst, and I take pride in having offensive memes for every occasion ready. Needless to say, I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile stuff. \n\n- My main hobby right now is Airsoft. I spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together since I ordered most of my gear from companies in Russia. \nThe centrepiece of my collection is my plate carrier which came with full kevlar inserts and was used by Russian anti-insurgency ops. \nQuite peeved, as I can\u2019t make it to the game that was supposed to happen tomorrow - my ride had something come up, and the team leader thinks it is appropriate to suggest that I bus for an hour and a half and meet him in a shopping centre (as compared to him driving for 15 extra minutes) while carrying 30 pounds of gear including the aforementioned ballistic vest and two firearms. And he also wanted to charge me 20$ for \u2018gas\u2019. \n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I think it is time to give up trying to categorize what I like by genre, and instead do it by what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord) I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n\nSome of my favourite bands are Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Muse, Green Day, Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, NIN and many, many more - if it is not obvious by this point, I am so edgy that I (used to) cut myself :D\n\n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%, due to a certain affinity for slithering neck-ties and positive human qualities like ambition, narcissism and general douchebaggery :D \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. Stuf like lack o punctuatuion impropar gramar to short n generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit. \n\nAgain, rephrasing the last part for dozens of people who simply don't get it: *you now know a certain amount about myself. After reading your message, I should be able to know a certain amount about you - not asking for something as in depth as here, but the \"Hello my name is X I am from Y and I like Z\" is not good enough.*\n\nAlso, here are some pictures of [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0), because why not? \n\n *Please, PMs only*! I loath Reddit Chat UI. I would prefer to talk here for the first while as compared to going over to certain apps whose names trigger bots..\nThe odds are, if you ignore this, I will either not see your Chat or don\u2019t reply on principle :3 \n... If you did not understand it, I am on the picky side.\n\nFeel free to hit me with your favourite ice breaker / shower question!

Also, this is not a quick read but I really do need advice. I thank anyone who took their time reading this &amp; left their opinions. \nI feel used, blindsided &amp; slapped in the face. \n\nThis is about Me and a friend we will call K (40f) \nLength known: 6 yrs\nK's new friend of less than 1 yr we will call B (32-40f unsure of exact age)\n\nLong story short; I (24f) ended up with no where to stay as I got myself back up on my feet. A friend (40f) of mine offered me a roof over my head and I told her it was only a temporary situation as well as a big thank you. She lives on disability &amp; in a HUD community. I'm not all that familiar with HUD but I am aware they have annual inspections for their government program properties. I did a post about other issues in regards to this friend I've known for 6 years only a few days ago if you want a more in depth of this situation. \n\nI've been there since January 18th after some unfortunate circumstances made it to where I needed a roof over my head. This is shortly after I spent the first week of January after work deep cleaning her apartment so she would pass her HUD inspection. K was made aware that this was a temporary situation.\n\nSince living there...I've done 98% of the cleaning in that apartment and I've been the ONLY ONE taking out the trash. K is a hermit who does everything she can to not leave that house. I wasn't free loading while living there trying to find a room to rent elsewhere, I do help K pay half her most expensive bill (not rent) and I try to keep the house clean as much as possible for my own health and off &amp; on using my car to run errands for her because she can't drive. \nHer dogs pee &amp; poop in the house so it stinks of feces, urine and cig smoke. \ud83d\ude37 \nThe condition the apartment has returned to, has been a slap in the face to both myself and my friend S who helped me out. \nI feel like she truly didnt appreciate our help and the fact she didnt follow through with paying S for gas to use her dads truck? Makes me so upset that she would do that to a friend of mine who I view as a sister! \nK: \"I appreciate this so much guys. You dont even know.\"\n\nFast forward to Thursday night.\nSince being at K's house, the cleaning that S &amp; I did has been in vain. The house smells of dog piss &amp; feces &amp; cig smoke. Then,\n5 weeks ago, K cleaned out her fridge of old food. The bag was so freaking heavy I could barely lift it. \nShe made the comment \"Oh man this bag is going to be so heavy! Hehe\" to which I replied \"Oh, dont worry about it. You're not the one lifting it.\" \nK didnt say anything after that. \nSo I placed it by the door and left it there to sit...and watched the pile of trash grow by that door. \nI was so fed up with being the only person taking out the trash that I wait...and waited...and waited...I asked on 3 to 4 separate occassions if she wanted to team up together, her taking the light bags and I the heavy ones and do a trash run. It never followed through. \n\nSo, I called after work Thursday to if she wanted to team up &amp; toss those trash bags. Miracle of all miracles, she told me those trash bags are gone now but there was one ready to be taken out from Wednesday. \nApproximately 7pm, K has her new friend B come over. B has pretty but taken over my old roll of doing things for K because I've became an unreliable resource for her.  K's found a new buddy in B. Our relationship started fracturing back in November when she wanted me to use MY ID for HER moms storage facility. I said no. \n\nB shows up at least 4 different times to grab K's rent, run to the store for her to get cigs (K lost her ID 3 yrs ago. Hasn't replaced it since), and a trash bag of K's laundry to wash &amp; dry for her.\nSo i go up stairs about the last time B came back over to drop off whatever it was she was dropping off.  K was coming down stairs to open the door for B as I was going up. \nB and K bullshit for a bit while I'm on the shitter and B asks if she can come in. K lets her in. \nI come back down stairs and start heading back to towards the water bottles in the kitchen. As B is leaving she goes \"Oh, hey, _______? Can you do me a favor? You know that trash bag thats right there? The one that was too heavy for me to lift? Can you take that out to the trash please?\"\nK stopped and replied \"Oh those are already gone\"\n\nI do know K is upset because I let her know approximately 4 days ago that I was leaving at the end of the month. I'd put down the deposit &amp; first months rent for a room from some very close friends of mine who've been waiting a year for the old tenant to vacate. \nI told her this was a temporary situation! And for her and her \"friend\" to just blindside me like that.\nI dont think K and I will remain friends after this. K doesnt seem to understand why I was so upset when B left. I kept my mouth shut for fear of saying something I'd regret later. \n\nHow do I even handle this situation?\nDo I even bring up all this shit to K and risk sound like a bitch? \nI'm a bit lost...and I want to leave NOW but I'd have to sleep in my car, otherwise as I wait for that room to open up and for my move in date, May 1st.\nAm I wrong to feel that B over stepped her boundaries? That she even had the odacity to talk to me about taking out K's trash? ", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

M texts me, \"What are your thoughts on S?\" I knew that she was going to tell S and that S was probably there, but M told me that S wasn't there. It didn't matter either way, because S was going to find out anyway. So, M told me to tell her what she thought about her AND S. And basically... I called S an ass, because she can kind of be a salty bitch sometimes. Anyways... turns out S WAS STILL THERE. I then get extremely angry and completely overreacted. I won't go into detail, but it pretty much involved me cussing a lot, which I don't normally do a lot of (or at least to these friends). And... now I think that S hates me even more now... I've been trying to tell her that I didn't mean anything, but, I can't tell if she just doesn't care or is mad at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: So, I asked S if she hated me even more now, and she said, \"Not really,\" so, yeah... I think she hates me even more now...", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm in the military, so it's sometimes kind of hard having a social life due to my schedule being pretty hectic. I love meeting new people and finding out things about them. Would prefer people who have the same interests as me, but it isn't a deal breaker.\n\nAbout me:\n\n* Sporty, enjoy playing sports as well as watching them. I played baseball in high school. I really only keep up with hockey and baseball.\n* From Texas, but currently living in TN/KY due to my job, which I love.\n* I listen to a lot of music. My music taste ranges from metal to rap. I pretty much like anything **BUT** country music. I'm pretty good at making playlists if I do say so myself.\n* I enjoy baking and will often send you a picture of what I make. Although baking brownies is simple, it's still my favorite thing to bake.\n* I run often, and kind of enjoy it sometimes.\n* Playing video games is one of my favorite \"hobbies.\" I have a PC, and will have a PS4 soon. Currently playing a lot of The Division 2 on PC. Fallout 4 is a favorite of mine. I mainly play FPS games, but often enjoy playing RTS/strategy games.\n* My favorite shows are The Office and Arrested Development. My favorite movies and Interstellar, What We Do in the Shadows and Tropic Thunder. The Marvel movies are also some of my favorites.\n* I'm a good listener! I enjoy talking to people about anything, even their problems.\n* Open minded, and I'd like to think I'm pretty nice. Do unto others and all that I guess.\n* I embarrass myself pretty easy, and I'll send you memes all the time. I reply to messages way too fast. Also I'm funny *sometimes.*\n\nFeel free to PM me! Literally ask me anything you wanna know.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

{"post_id": "baj8wn", "created_utc": 1554660988, "title": "AITA for feeling like giving up on a friendship?", "author": "benbarlume", "self_text": "I (23M) have been very close friends with a guy (40M) for a number of years. He has been a shoulder to cry on and a source of advice in some very challenging times, and has often been the only person who I felt I could turn to for sound advice. He is funny, and I have a good time whenever we spend time together. We met because he owned a bar where I worked for a bit and we just clicked.\n\nWhen the bar closed, I was massively underpaid (we're talking thousands) with no explanation or apology. In fact, after around 4 months of not being paid at all and taking out credit cards to make rent, all while banking on the money eventually coming in, I was really screwed over financially for a while. He asked me to go to get him some cigarettes from the shop after I got paid that final time, and while I was there I checked his bank balance at an ATM. He had thousands upon thousands sitting in his account. This money was well earned and he'd worked hard for it, but it was more than he reasonably needed. I've always felt a bit screwed over by this, but I've managed to get over it and I rarely think about it now.\n\nFlash forward around 3 years to the present day, and he's the manager of a pub where I work, mostly by coincidence, partly through mutual friends in the right places. I recently accepted a job with a rival company for more money, progression etc, and it goes without saying it was the right move. Everyone I know has told me they're happy for me, it's the right choice, etc, except said friend. Instead, he has constantly told me I'm not ready to progress, told me I'm disloyal and he can't understand it all. Any attempt to convince him otherwise is frugal as he suddenly doesn't want to talk about it once his points are challenged in any way; we \"agree to disagree\" even though I haven't expressed my views at all. He has spoken to my colleagues and friends and expressed these views and from the feedback I've gotten, he is being entirely negative about me in the process of doing so. I thought he would want the best for me and it's upsetting to know that deep down, he doesn't. \n\nI've recently been going through some relationship issues and I've often looked to him for advice. Instead of the genuine friend he was 3 years ago, he now responds with comments which make it seem like my problems cause him stress and he has no time for them. He very recently said, after he gave me advice that I chose not to follow, \"I don't know why I waste my breath and cause myself so much stress trying to help you. It affected my business before (referring to the bar that closed down) and I'm not going to even bother with it again.\" (Paraphrasing but accurately so). This is despite the fact that the decision I made with regards to my relationship has ultimately both nothing to do with him personally, and resulted in happiness for myself. I appreciate the advice in general, but I struggle to wrap my head around the idea that just because my happiness doesn't come about as a result or his direct advice, it therefore seems invalid. \n\nOn top of this, he holds some views which I find to be very questionable. We are both out and proud members of the LGBTQ community, yet he actively makes transphobic comments. He is also casually racist a lot of the time, to the point where it's hard to believe he's joking even though when questioned he acts like he is. This couldn't be further from the person that I am, and I can't ever talk about these things without being shot down by him saying things like \"nope, nonsense\" while I'm mid sentence. Most of my friends are left wing, and I'd consider myself centre left. I enjoy being politically engaged, and I appreciate having friends who feel the same, and this cannot be said for said friend.\n\nDespite all of this, however, I still care for my friend and appreciate the things he has done for me. Am I letting him walk all over me? Why am I finding it so hard to stand up for myself (something I never usually struggle with)? I have tried and failed to talk to him about it on multiple occasions and I now genuinely believe he cannot be spoken to. Should I accept that the friendship has failed?

She is so supportive and gets me emotionally and I can always count on her to be there for me and I try to do the same for her. We're both around mid 20's age wise.

I like having someone I talk to everyday, about little stuff that wouldn't normally come up or just someone to vent to/talk to throughout the day. But sometimes I do need my space! And it has nothing to do with the other person, I need space from people I'm in romantic relationship with. Like I just feel like that's a normal human thing for some people. But when I go 24 hours without responding to her, she essentially thinks it's because I don't want to be her friend anymore. And she can be really passive aggressive about it \"haven't heard from you in a bit, hope you're not mad at me.\" Or \"can't wait to hear from you\" but it comes across as her reminding me to respond or passive aggressively saying she wants me to respond. And I've told her before that she doesn't have to worry if she doesn't hear from me for a few days. I understand her anxiety and need for validation, but I feel like it's perfectly fine for me to expect to not get bombarded with messages just because I haven't responded to her in a day. There was even a time that I was having a really bad week and I communicated that to her and told her I would respond when I could and she still bugged me with messages.

It kinda stung when she said it at first but I thought that I was probably just being too sensitive since it was just a joke &amp; that I\u2019d probably get used to the humour soon enough so there was no point acting hurt.\n\nIn a way of trying to carry on the joke-y rudeness, I started being rude back. I didn\u2019t think I was that rude at the time since it was similar to what she did sometimes but I texted her \u201cNO!\u201d or something along those lines when she was talking about something like spongebob vore. \n\nIn response, she got quiet. I asked what was wrong and she said I shouted at her. I apologised, explaining that I only did it because she normally does the caps lock shouty thing when I\u2019m talking about weird stuff. She replied by telling me to shut the fuck up. \n\nI\u2019m sure she meant it in a jokey way but I felt kind of hurt. She still makes rude jokes with me and friend C, but if I act the same way it doesn\u2019t feel well received by L. \n\nI feel like if I ask her to stop, she\u2019ll just take it as a joke or something and tell me to shut to fuck up or call me a pussy (she hasn\u2019t called me this but has called C this, so I doubt she ever would with me) or if I just bring it up out of the blue, she\u2019ll say something like \u201cwhen was the last time I did that?\u201d I\u2019m bad with remembering times and quotes so I\u2019ll only have two examples that I saved from months ago that don\u2019t even look that bad.

I meant \u201cI don\u2019t think I like it\u201d, not \u201cI don\u2019t think like it\u201d.\n\nEdit#2: I made the pronouns a little confusing, sorry.

Anyway, I have all the symptoms. I also have mediocre self esteem, trust issues, social anxiety, anxiety in general and ADHD (all diagnosed by a professionnal)\n\nYesterday, I explained to my best friends that I was feeling that they were ignoring me and that they were annoyed because of the sad comments I said sometimes, often not a the best times. (For example, we will all have a great time and I will say something like I'm so sad or I will get better, right? and they will seem annoyed at me for ruining their moment.) So, at first, they just ignored me. When I said that an answer would be appreciated, they said that they had nothing to say. When I started to cry and running to the bathroom and cried there for an hour before seeking help to the prof (we were in a school trip), they ignored me. I know they were very tired but seriously  it was the worst way they could have responded. I think they just have gived up on trying to help me, since even if I get better for a while, it just goes down anyway. The morning after that, they acted like nothing had happened. The oldest of my best friend (2 years older than me) acted like nothing happening but say things to make me guilty often. \n\nI would have understood if I wasn't trying to help myself, or if they weren't accustomed to helping friends, but our friendship was mainly based on helping each other. Now, that they are going great, and that they don't need me to help them, they just decided that it was too much for them to handle. Also, when I was doing ok and they were going badly, I helped them.\n\nAlso, my only other best friend needs my help because he doesn't go well either and my mother (my only parent) count on me to keep on my smile because she is very tired these days (she tried to kill herself two times last year). Also, my two little sisters are going trough manipulation from their friends and intimidation and I must help them since my mother can't.\n\nMy friends are usually very good persons, I don't know what to do.

Brought up a fight with my brother and sister. Then tried to change my mind by spending some time on my phone. Realized that a friend of mine have deleted me on Snapchat. I can no longer contact her. At first I decided to send her some aggressive messages but then I took a deep breath. Told myself that it happens all the time. That no one owes you.\n\nI then turned to my WhatsApp and wrote one of my so-called friends saying \"Hey, how have you been?\". whom I met through this sub when she sent me a message on reddit saying my post really inspired her and that she wants to be my \"friend\". A few minutes passed and I realise that she blocked me right after reading my text on WhatsApp.\n\nSo what's the point of all this rant? It's just to tell you that if you're being ignored by someone, you're not alone and even tho it would hurt  a bit, it is definitely not impossible to get over the feeling and get into a happy happy mood.\n\nWhat I've learned from this experience once again is that those were not really my \"friends\". No definitely not if they only ever want to talk to you when you're at your best. And if one of those badasses cut you out of your life, celebrate it. Because you just got rid of someone who did not really care about you. You don't need these kind of people in your life.

I will probably take an economic direction, since I want to start my own business later or have a higher function at a company. \n\n\nI think I'm kinda basic when it comes to hobbies. I play football, I play on the Ps4 now and then, I go to the gym regularly and watch a shit ton of YouTube everyday and hang out with friends. Oh yeah, I also like to exchange memes daily. There's probably more I could tell about myself but this post is already getting to long. Feel free too message me", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}
{"post_id": "baz76i", "created_utc": 1554757769, "title": "My friend valued her kids FOMO more than my health (and life).", "author": "Bedinborough", "self_text": "Longest post ever:\n\nTL;DR: My (ex)friend didn\u2019t think exposing me (f30s with cancer) to influenza is a big deal. If I had a problem I should stay home and avoid all public contact. \n\nSo I\u2019ve had a group of friends for about four years. We\u2019re in our 30s and met as a result of our kids going to preschool together. I\u2019ll use made-up names to avoid confusion: Mary, Sue, and Carrie. Mary and Sue have kids, but Carrie is Mary\u2019s sister and cared for Mary\u2019s kids while she worked, so we saw each other at school pick-up a lot. It took awhile to become friends. We started with play dates and things went from there. We spend the most time together in the summer, because all our kids have sports and other activities and the others all work now except for me. I\u2019ve been fighting cancer for five years, on and off, but mostly on. It was a medical miracle that I survived the first time. I even had the \u201cyou\u2019re not going to make it\u201d talk from the doctors. Having some of the best surgeons and oncologists in the world (and a ridiculous amount of chemo) got me into remission. A couple years later it came back and I had a third surgery, which went fairly well, and they didn\u2019t recommend chemo or radiation. In January I went for my scan, and lo and behold, it\u2019s back. This is a very deadly cancer, so we weren\u2019t too surprised, but sad. I told my friends it came back and tried to get them to plan a get-together so we could see each other before surgery. It didn\u2019t work out, but we planned to meet up at the St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade in our town. It\u2019s a big deal because we live in an Irish town and there\u2019s lots of events to attend, and contests to enter, along with the regular getting drunk on green beer. The parade is a family event and the exciting part is that two of my kids, my girls, were in the parade this year for the first time. We agree to meet at a certain spot, and since I have to drop off kids early to line up for the parade, I say I\u2019ll set up chairs and save a good spot for us. My surgery is scheduled for six days after the parade. You need to know that my very talented surgeon is moving across the country one week after my surgery. I can\u2019t reschedule with him. He\u2019s gone after that and I don\u2019t even know if they have good talent to replace him at my prestigious hospital. So one day before the parade Mary writes a message in our group chat (we have a regular one we all use to keep in touch). She says two of her kids have the flu. Like actual influenza. (The flu shot wasn\u2019t very effective this year, and it\u2019s going around more than normal.) She says she\u2019s going to bring the kids but they\u2019ll sit in the car and she\u2019ll come out and socialize. (The following is almost word for word the conversation we had.) I said (very calmly, I might add, because I had a gut feeling this was going to be a thing.) that\u2019s not a good idea for me. I have surgery in less than a week to remove cancer and I can\u2019t knowingly risk getting the flu. It would upend my life. I can\u2019t reschedule my surgery if I get sick. She said, well I\u2019m going to sit at my usual spot (where we were all planning to park and meet up so I could see them before I went in the hospital) and I\u2019ll be in the open air and if it\u2019s a problem I just won\u2019t touch you. I said, ok. She replied, I didn\u2019t plan on getting in your vehicle anyway and it\u2019s not like I was planning on leaving my kids alone in the car to watch the parade. (Which contradicted what she just said before.) I said, It\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll move somewhere else. Mary replies, Seriously I get your worry but I\u2019m not going to be anywhere near you and it\u2019s outside but do whatever. With you being so worried about getting sick I\u2019d suggest not being around anyone in any public place the kids dr said there\u2019s so many cases of the flu at this time rt now. (So now I\u2019m getting pissed. She\u2019s telling me that I need to stay home so her sick kids can see a damn parade, and risk infecting all types of people. There\u2019s lots of people who can\u2019t get a flu shot. It\u2019s a huge family event. People bring their little ones, babies if it\u2019s warm enough, and all sorts of elderly people come to watch too. They\u2019re especially vulnerable to complications from the flu.) So I said, Yes, but I\u2019m not going to be near someone who is knowingly in contact with two people with the flu. I can\u2019t knowingly do that and I wouldn\u2019t do that to you or anyone else. It wouldn\u2019t be an accident. I\u2019m going somewhere else because this is life and death for me. I need every tiny thing in my favor to live. So that\u2019s your choice. I\u2019m going somewhere else. Mary answers, I clearly already said I wasn\u2019t going to be near you just so your aware I would never put anyone at risk for the flue HENCE WHY I WROTE THE GROUP IN THE FIRST PLACE. Then she leaves the group chat. It felt like she knew I was going to disagree with her and she was gearing up for a fight. Every message she wrote seemed to contradict the last, and she was reaching to try and make excuses as to why her little kids seeing a parade was more important than anyone else\u2019s health. They didn\u2019t have a cold, they had influenza. If she said, she was going to park somewhere away from people so they could see the parade, I would understand. I\u2019m the one who had two kids in the parade. They were very excited for us to see them, and made sure they found us in the crowd. She also messed with my chance to see my other friends too. Carrie is her sister and no matter what happens she\u2019s going to have to be on Mary\u2019s side. Sue still tried to meet up with me at the parade but where I ended up parking filled up fast and she was late getting ready so she parked down the road. My daughter saw the flu kids at the parade running out and taking candy from the hands of the kids in the parade passing them out. (We\u2019ve been told by police not to throw so kids don\u2019t run in the street and risk getting hurt.) My little kiddo overheard me telling some of this story to my hubby and was worried that she might somehow pass germs onto me through one of her friends who touched the sick kids. I assured her it\u2019s nothing to worry about, and that as long as she washes her hands regularly, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. So before my surgery Sue made sure to come and see me and tell me that she was here if I needed anything\u2014help cleaning the house, help with kids, or just someone to talk to. She checked in with me after surgery, and came to visit when I started feeling better. I haven\u2019t heard a peep from Mary or Carrie. I thought Mary would be more compassionate since she lost a friend unexpectedly a couple years ago. She got a tattoo reminding her that you never know how much time you have, and to appreciate it. How do I deal with this? I haven\u2019t talked to her since. I don\u2019t want to, but we live in small town and I\u2019m going to run into her. Sue is still friends with Mary and Carrie but has told me what she did wasn\u2019t okay. She\u2019s the type of person not to make enemies out of anyone. She\u2019s friendly with the whole town. I don\u2019t feel like she needs to distance herself, but she\u2019s probably going to spend some time with them in the future, especially since I\u2019ll probably be sidelined by chemo for the next several months (at least). I\u2019m sad about missing summer fun with my kids (swimming at the beach is our favorite thing in life). Do I avoid Mary and Carrie? I won\u2019t ignore her kids\u2014they\u2019re wonderful and it\u2019s not their fault their mom is inconsiderate. At the very least do I delete her from Facebook? I\u2019m lost and sad.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Yay\nI feel like I\u2019m being very nosy but I genuinely need to know from the mouth of Blue, how they are doing and if they feel manipulated they can talk to me about it and we can work together, I\u2019m actually scared for Blue and I just want to make sure everything is ok. \nWhat is everyone\u2019s thoughts?

I came here because I desperately need some advice about a close friend of mine.\n\nTo make a long story short, he\u2019s incredibly clingy to the point where I can\u2019t distinguish whether he\u2019s completely obsessed with me or if he is just a really needy guy.\n\nWe\u2019re both mid 20\u2019s, and we live very close to each other. We used to hang out often because it was mutual. But it\u2019s gotten to the point where it\u2019s weird.. he messages me every single MORNING asking to hang out in the evening.. EVERY day. \n\nI\u2019ve started to respond less, tell him I\u2019m busy etc but he still messages me EVERY day to ask! I have said no every day for the past month, and recently he is asking to hang out a little less (now only 4-5 times a week..) \n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is, any normal human being would be able to tell I clearly am not interested in hanging out every day, because I respond late, brush him off and tell him I\u2019m busy or simply DONT want to. But he continues to guilt trip me into hanging out with him. I\u2019ve lost a lot of respect for him and I\u2019m borderline creeped out..\n\nIt\u2019s almost like I\u2019m starting to feel like his girlfriend.. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s me or him who\u2019s messed in the head. I think on some level I didn\u2019t create enough boundaries early on, he even wants to hang out when I have my gf over .. he doesn\u2019t mind being the third wheel.. he will do just about anything in his power to get to hang with me every night. \n\nWe would usually smoke weed and chill before, but then he started asking me to come to his house and watch movies and play videos games.. I\u2019m 25 years old I think that shit is fuckin wack for 2 grown men to hang out EVERY night and play games\n\nHe\u2019s a decent looking successful guy with a gf and a good family / social life. Same with me. But for the life of me I can\u2019t understand why he is so possessive and needy with me EVERY day. He gets sour and butt hurt when I tell him I\u2019m busy or I can\u2019t. It\u2019s to the point where I can\u2019t message him back right away I wait 2-3 hours to respond.. and he literally texts back within 15 seconds..\n\nWhat pisses me off the most is when the weekends come I like to go out (we live in a big city) and club, bar hop etc. He has all the free time during the week to play patty cake together late at night like 5 year olds but when the weekend comes he always makes excuses to not go out. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s just pussy whipped by his girlfriend (she parties a lot so I think he tries to hang with her on the weekend so she can\u2019t go out clubbing) but if he can\u2019t make effort to do other things normal mid 20 guys do then I\u2019m not done hanging with him just because I feel obligated. \n\nAny advice? \n\nWas I too laid back and didn\u2019t create any boundaries earlier on? Is he just a really needy guy? Or is has he become obsessed with me? Should I continue blowing him off until he settles down? \n\nI don\u2019t want to cut him off but I need space, it\u2019s become something of a relationship and it\u2019s really weirding me out, even my gf is scratching her head about this, it doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nThoughts?\n\n(Ps thanks for reading and sorry for the long post)", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "bbbw9k", "created_utc": 1554836653, "title": "How to get over a friendship that I ended?", "author": "KatTheHuman_42", "self_text": " So this story is kinda old, but I found it difficult to get over it and I\u2019m trying to get some objective perspectives on here. I don't know if tis is the right place, but I'm tired and I really need help. \n\nI\u2019d like to say, I was a major pushover and people pleaser for the longest time and let many things slip throughout that friendship without really speaking up.\n\nThis is about a girl who I befriended on the first day of uni approximately four years ago. At first, we hit it off very well. She was very easy to talk to and she was overall nice. She would become my best friend in the new city very quickly and I was glad that I found someone to turn to and someone to have fun with that fast (I was super afraid I would be lonely).\n\nIt only took a few months for me to see that she was kind of selfish, and at that time it didn\u2019t seem too bad for me. After all, I believe everyone is and should at least a bit \u201cegoistic\u201d in healthy amounts as long as you don\u2019t forget to care about other people entirely and don\u2019t hurt anyone. One of the things that are still in my head is that she would mostly plan out her weeks and weekends and then expect me to just roll with it maybe. Like she came to me and said, \u201cI\u2019m here then and then, we can hang out or party at that specific time.\u201d I didn\u2019t mind it. She was important to me and mostly, our plans fit together anyway.\n\nThen, after maybe a year total of being friends, she started to behave\u2026.. well, more like herself maybe? She started to snap at me for stupid reasons. Now that doesn\u2019t sound that bad. But I seriously cannot deal with being barked by the same person over and over for stupid shit like when she disagreed on something. One time she got angry at me for something I cannot remember, but the impact it had on me was not as small. I started hurting myself when I was a teenager as a coping mechanism and also to punish myself. At that point I hadn\u2019t touched myself in a year. After being hissed at, it started again - I sat there and secretly scratched my arms again and started wishing I could die again. I\u2019m really not saying it was her fault. It isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s duty to care about these things or treat me differently; also not many Real Life People know that about me and I think I didn\u2019t tell her. I also was still struggling with being happy overall, so it wasn\u2019t her fault in that sense. It just stuck with me, that moment. Like the connection was made in my head. Eventually, I did tell her I disliked the way she spoke to me sometimes and that\u2019s when I learned she did not take criticism very well. She said/half shouted something like \u201cI saw that you didn\u2019t like it! I just didn\u2019t say anything right then. You know how I am; I just can\u2019t in these situations.\u201d She didn\u2019t change her tone in these kinds of situations. And I stopped criticizing her because I thought she was too important for me to have around. After all, I didn\u2019t have any other good friends in that town. My best friends from school lived elsewhere.\n\nOf course, not everything was bad! She was good to drink and to party with. Partying and dancing in clubs was something I\u2019d never done as a shy teenager so I liked that I could do it with her. Also, she could be caring at times when it came to sharing food and stuff. And, even though she wasn\u2019t good at \u201cdeep\u201d conversations (that I missed because I had many cool convos with my high school friends) and didn\u2019t think about some things all that much, she TRIED. She also wasn\u2019t the best at \u201cbeing there\u201d in tough situations; she would mostly stare and not say anything or peer towards her phone (that\u2019s another thing that bothered me, she was constantly on her phone but took hours to reply to messages). Talking to her was mostly kind of shallow, but that\u2019s okay to me. Not everyone enjoys talking about shit that\u2019s so far from life. Not everyone\u2019s built for that. You could talk to her about boys, though.\n\nSo that\u2019s the situation we started in.\n\nThen I met my first boyfriend. There, I realized she was unable to be happy for me. When I excitedly told her, she said \u201cOh, good luck\u201d and regarding that we met on tinder: \u201cSeems like that does actually work.\u201d And then she went back to her food. Whenever I tried to come for advice for her or tried talking relationships with her, she rolled her eyes at me. I later learned it was because she was unhappy with her boyfriend then. But she never indicated that to me. Which was nothing new cause she often lied to me and herself anyway. Very often.\n\nAnd we grew apart. She stopped inviting me out and I would learn of plans after they happened. While I made an effort to tell her about my life, she decided it wasn\u2019t any of my business anymore, which is her right to do, but hurt me. \n\nShe continued to do asshole-ish things, e.g. making a racist/fat joke about me and when I was hurt, she snapped at me and told me \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t make such jokes. But we\u2019re friends after all!\u201d\n\nShe also became obsessed with herself after breaking up with her bf. Didn\u2019t consider any other people\u2019s feelings anymore. She made everything about herself. I got the feeling she only hung around with me because I wasn\u2019t as pretty as her. She even told me once I just wasn\u2019t pretty (not directly though). We stopped going to lunch together, which had been our \u201cthing\u201d, and started to go with other people without telling me. \n\nShe met a new guy she liked and told me as excitedly about him as I did with my bf. I made an effort to be happy for her and show her, but I was still thinking about how she reacted when I wanted to tell her about my new relationship.\n\nMy boyfriend started questioning why I was still friends with her. I often came home and told him about another thing she did and he was the one who asked if that wasn\u2019t shitty. I tried defending her. But deep down, I think I already knew her and I didn\u2019t match as friends. Like I tried to tell her when something bothered me and she always told me she knew, why didn\u2019t she try to change at least her tone of voice? I grew tired of it. I grew tired of trusting her with so much and always being there for her and feeling like she didn\u2019t care. Like, when her grandpa died, I spent hours on the phone with her. When I asked her about if she thought I should go see a doctor for feeling suicidal, she couldn\u2019t even be bothered to take her eyes off her phone. I didn\u2019t want to be lied to anymore. I didn\u2019t want to be told I wasn\u2019t good enough looking for love while I always tried to lift her up. I didn\u2019t want to feel excluded from her life anymore. Like if she didn\u2019t want me anyways, why should I stay and let her treat me poorly? \n\nI just stopped caring about her. Her always talking about herself started to get on my nerves. I started treating her indifferently and stopped telling her stuff and I stopped giving her compliments or asking her about her life. \n\nOne day, after I found out about plans she'd made without considering if I wanted to go, I wrote her a message saying if she didn\u2019t want me in her life anymore, she should please tell me, it would be okay for me, I just wanted to know. These are the words. She ignored me.\n\nAfter that, I went to her in a seminar just to be ignored for five minutes and then being told she was unsure if she wanted to talk to me again. I left, cried, I deleted her number, I unfollowed her on social media. I did not want to have anything to do with her anymore. Two and a half years of her being a bad friend I was kind of okay with because she did all that well within her rights and I am no one to judge, but that pushed me over the edge.\n\nThe next day, she came to me and snatched me out of a conversation I was having: \n\nHer: \u201cCan we talk?\u201d \n\nMe: \u2026.\n\nHer: Please!? (Said in an annoyed tone.)  \n So I went. And was yelled at. She told me she just COULDN\u2019T understand why I went and tried to talk to her after that rude message I sent. She even mockingly imitated me how I stood there. She also told me a bunch of other stuff, but I don\u2019t want to bother to write that down. I told her everything I wrote above. And then she told me she wanted to take a break and see where it went. I straight up told her that after she ignored me, I didn\u2019t want anything to do with her anymore. The day after that, I stopped greeting her and started ignoring her. And I felt so liberated.   \n I do not think it really hurt her. She has enough other friends that are better for her. I don\u2019t want to see her. I gladly walk past her without having to listen to her talk about herself.\n\nBut although I was the one who decided I didn\u2019t want her in my life anymore, I can\u2019t get over it. I still feel that she has treated me unfairly and will never see how her behavior could be hurtful. And she is in my dreams. I can\u2019t sleep because of that. I just want to get over it. I\u2019m tired. I know I did things wrong, too. I can be overbearing, I can be too interested in my friends\u2019 lives, I am oversensitive. I know what I did wrong and I know how to better myself.

The group chat too is so fragmented, only the samepeople talking, while the \"main\" friend has left cause he said he was \"pissed off and had to\". (Meanwhile the night he left he was so high off coke) I just dont know what to do. Clearly i need new friends, but how do i go about the situation? Do i just leave the group chat and go ghost?

I used to be quite fluent in German too!  \n\n* I am a vegetarian moving towards veganism for moral, environmental, and health reasons.\n\n* Lately I've made it more of a priority to take care of myself.  Weight training, hikes, and eating better.  It was kinda hard to do when I had so much work and such tight deadlines for school.  But I'm already stronger than I was and that's what counts!\n\n* I try to live as much of a zero waste lifestyle as possible.  I think I've eliminated all disposable products from my life at this point.\n\n* I love shopping at thrift stores, in fact most of my clothes are from Value Village!\n\n* I have a small fountain pen collection and really like mixing my own inks.  I have a prison pen pal and few others in different countries.\n\n* I make my own body soap, shampoo, hair rinses, and face masks.  I do this because I know what's in my own soap, it creates less plastic waste, and it's much much cheaper!\n\n* I have an Xbox and a Switch and use video games to relax. Lately I really like Fortnite. But I also like Battlefield games, COD, and Mario games.\n\n* I have 3 cats and a husband.\n\n* I volunteer at a prison as a tutor biweekly.\n\n* I have geology and computer science degrees.  If you're not careful, you might prompt me to go off on a tangent about rocks.  :)  Especially while hiking.\n\n* I am very interested in permaculture and gardening. I have a small potted garden on my deck. I'm learning about canning too!  I'd love to be able to preserve my own food.  My dream is to one day move to Alaska and create my own self-sufficient home.\n\n* I'm passionate about education and politics.  I want to help as many people as possible in my lifetime and I'm thinking about one day running for office.  My views are that we should be investing in ourselves, our society, in our future - things such as  education and healthcare (among other things) should be provided.\n\nIf this resonates with you and you're near Seattle, message me!

My name is Madison, and I've made a post on this sub a while ago, like five months ago. I met some really really cool people that I'm still honored to call my friends, but I decided I wanted to meet some more equally cool people! \n\nI like to give full disclosure before people get invested in a friendship with me, because I think it's only fair. I'm a cocktail of mental issues, including pretty severe anxiety and depression. I would say I'm okay like 75-80% of the time when I'm talking to people, but the other 25-20% (did I even do that math right? idk) I can be anxious, mopey, sad, whatever adjective you wanna use. Sometimes I get too emotionally attached to people, way too quickly, but on the other hand I sometimes feel like I'm bothering everyone and I won't message you first in fear of annoying you. I'm a confusing person, I know.\n\nI'm not saying this to necessarily scare people off or anything, I just want people to know what they're getting into before they invest their time in a friendship with me. I value honesty and openness, and since I expect it from you I'm going to give it, too. I'm not all bad, though! I like to think I'm a good listener, and I try to be a very genuine person. I want to know about your day when I ask, so don't hesitate to tell me! I'm usually pretty chill (when my anxiety isn't acting up, of course), and while I'm busy a lot, I always make time for my friends. I'm very open-minded, and I'm willing to make friends with people of any gender, age, location, whatever, as long as they're not a total jerkface. \n\nI laugh at dumb jokes, I like to call people loving nicknames like \"dork\" and \"nerd\" and \"loser\" (it's out of love, I promise), I really like to voice chat, though I don't have a toooon of time for it, I love horror movies and disney movies equally (remember when I said I was a confusing person? lmao), and I pet any stray cat I come across that allows me to. I think knowing the type of person I am is more important than knowing my hobbies, but I like D&amp;D, video games (PC, I have tons of multiplayer, just ask!), photography, shitposts especially when no one else finds them funny except me and you, and sitting in my room pretending I have an actual life.\n\nIf you read all of this, congratulations, I love you. You can have one friendship point! If you read all of this and still feel like messaging this trash tier human, hit me up! I have Discord, Snap, and reddit, obviously. I hope you have a lovely day, potential new friends!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I tend to overthink things. I am pretty introverted but also kinda lonely.  I'm into math, science, history, and the great outdoors. I love listening to music and doing research. A few of my favorite YouTube channels are Vsauce, Numberphile, Studio C, Failarmy, and Mumbo Jumbo.  I really like puns/dadjokes, humor is pretty great, I can laugh almost anytime, which is kinda funny, lol. As far as TV shows go my two favs are Phineas and Ferb then The Office. Trees are probably my favorite things on earth, i'm thinking about being an arborist for a living, i'd love to study and take care of trees, i'm pretty passionate about them. :) I love Truth and Logic, which is part of why I love research and data. Microsoft Excel is great, formulas are complicated though, haha. For movies The Princess Bride is one of my favs, the swordfight in it is epic. Star Wars and LOTR are probably my 2 favorite series, along with the Hobbit. I enjoy reading fiction, I don't read a lot anymore though.     I've made a list of almost every person who has been verified to turn 110 years old and I can tell you how old they were/are relative to other supercentenarians, both living and dead. \nFor games I like Mario, Galaxy 2 was great. For online games it's mainly an idle incremental called The Kittens Game, don't judge it(or me) by it's name, it's actually a really deep and complex game. I'm looking forward to the Falcon Heavy launch tomorrow.  \nFeel free to PM me or whatever, it might take me awhile to reply though. I'm generally a happy guy, except for when i'm not. lol.

We smoked one blunt Friday night and then another Saturday morning we still had about 3g left because we had some leftover from a few days ago (which I also helped pay for). Saturday  his friends from home came up to visit and he said he would text me to come over to his dorm later. However he  did not  and  I texted him asking him to smoke or just chill and did not receive a text back. I then texted him again about 2 hours later trying to see if he maybe forgot but still got no answer and didn't for the rest of the night. I then texted him the next morning wondering why he didn't respond and when he finally texted me back he seemed to just dodge my question and just said how his friends were really drunk all night once they arrived. I told him that a simple text wasn't that hard to send me instead of just blowing me off all night. Keep in mind he has done this a lot recently where I will text him to do something like hang out and he will flat out ignore me and never respond so I'd had enough and called him out this time. Anyways he finally said sorry after dancing around my question and  I asked if he wanted to smoke and he said it was all gone. I asked what happened and he said we smoked the last of it Saturday morning and this was when I got really mad and I said that we both knew there was some left and then he continues to say how he wasn't sure when he smoked it and that he bought more at some point but then smoked that also and just continued talking in circles. I then told him that it doesn't matter when you smoked it I payed for half of it and now it's all gone because you smoked most of it and lied on top of it. He was like well I payed for half of it too as if that gives him the right to smoke most of it by himself when I payed for it I told him that after blowing me off all Saturday night and smoking the rest of the weed without me that I was mad at him and he did not respond after that. I am not sure where to go at this point with him this is also not the first time I feel he has tried to take advantage of me like this.

It was very uncomfortable for me, I made friend shake on it, that he would never leave me alone with neighbor if the opportunity presented itself. I have no doubt that if friend wasn\u2019t there, neighbor would have sexually assaulted me.\n\nNow, my friend downplays the whole scenario, we have all been there, he says. I\u2019ve brought it up exactly twice and each time he said, it\u2019s not a big deal, and we all do dumb shit while drunk. I don\u2019t expect him to be my white knight and protect my honor but, am I crazy or was neighbor jumping way over the line?  \n\nNow, I don\u2019t know that I will be able to trust my friend to have my back in situations, especially when there is a benefit to having me and neighbor working together. \n\nWhat do you guys think?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

He said he was ok, just a but disappointed. The following day, he was really down so I went to see him and he showed me self inflicted burns and knife Mark's on his arm. I was completely shocked by this as I wasn't prepared for it, but I sat with him for 8 hours and told him it was ok and everything would be ok. He said he was scared to spend the night alone because he was worried by what he might do so i sat up with him and only went home when he fell asleep.\n\nThe next morning, i called him up and he was on top of the world which was odd as he'd been lower than I'd ever seen him just a few hours beforehand. This triggered massive alarm bells, and I'd asked him what had happened to cause such a massive 180. He said nothing had changed, so I asked if he'd been back in touch with the girl and he got really defensive and said no. I told him how worried I was and for the next week he kept up the pretense and told me he still felt really down and that I was worrying about nothing, he wasn't talking to her and I had to trust him when he said he was ok.\n\nI tried calling yesterday and he kept hanging up before sending a message saying he felt a bit down and didn't feel like talking. Then a few hours later, he calls me up saying he'd just been on a date with this girl and he was really happy. I was, and still am confused by what has happened.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I was over the moon he'd found a girl, and was equally sad for him when it all fizzled out but I was there for him irrespective.\n\nAfter telling me about his date, I told him that I was confused because he had told me something different to the reality of the situation and chose not to tell me why he had a massive change in the space of a couple of hours. I had been calling suicide lines and the samaritans because he had led me to believe and kept me believing that he was going to take his own life, when in fact he was seeing some girl all along.\n\nI confronted him last night and he said it my own fault for assuming he was suicidal!! The dude just a few days before made it a point to show me his self-inflicted wounds and gave me no reason to think any differently despite me asking directly.\n\nI don't know what to think as I'm still reeling from having spent a week worrying about him when in reality he was having a lovely time with this girl!\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed so any insight would be welcome as I'm to hurt/confused/angry to think", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "bboye2", "created_utc": 1554918183, "title": "This is my story", "author": "xThisIsMyStory", "self_text": "This is my story. I'm 31 years old. I'm married, and my wife and I have two boys ages 11 and 3. From the outside looking in my life may seem fairly normal, but there are some demons in my past. My dad was never around. He is a violent alcoholic who had his own troubles when he was growing up. When my mother was 17, he raped her. That is when I was conceived. My mom always had trouble with men in her life. She was drawn to abusive assholes until she met my first step dad. He was a kind soul. When my mother was pregnant with my younger sister, he was murdered in a gang initiation. I was 5 years old. From there it was a downward spiral for my mom. Some of my earliest memories are her telling me how bad my dad was. How violent he was, how evil he was. She would then tell me I am just like him. \n\nMy mom is a narcissist. I remember my entire childhood being about how things affected her. How she didn't deserve this or that. My preteen and teenage years were rough. The mental and emotional abuse from my mother continued. I remember one day seeing her with a black eye, and fat lip. She lashed out at me. Same story, how bad my father is and how I am just like him. Constant repeating loop every day of my life. My grandmother did her best to shield me from this. We lived with my moms parents my entire childhood. My grandmother was the only woman in my life that truly cared about me. Telling me how nice I am, how smart I am, and how handsome I am. She got sick when I was 13, and passed when I was 15. I dropped out of high school and cared for her the best I could the last 9 months of her life. Something broke in me when that happened. One day my mom lashed out, and I erupted. Something must have scared her that day because that's when she dropped it on me. My father raped her. I was the product of rape. \n\nI don't really remember much else from that year. Something had changed. I didn't care anymore. Anything risky I could do, I did. Drugs, running from the cops, getting involved with bad people. From that point on I did what I wanted to do when I wanted to do it. Until that came to a screeching halt at the age of 18. I was arrested for possession. I decided it was time for a change. I got clean, and got back in touch with my wife. We had met in 9th grade. We were part of a small group of friends. She is a kind person. She doesn't know, but she saved my life. I was contemplating suicide, and had begun to prepare when we got back in touch. The next 13 years of our lives had their ups and downs. We had our first child at 21. In 2008 I lost my job and fell into a deep depression. That was the beginning of a very hard part of our relationship. \n\nShe ended up cheating on me with guys she met online. Nothing physical, but emotional affairs, sexting, sending nudes. We broke up in 2012. I ended up marrying my rebound which was a stupid decision. I still hadn't dealt with the issues from my childhood at this time. Never confronted those demons. They scared me. After divorcing my rebound, we got back together. I married her in 2014. We had our second child at the end of 2015. Things were alright, but my mental health was wore down. We didn't communicate well, and my issues continued to cause problems. She had another emotional affair in March of this year. It was a short affair, but an affair none the less. I don't know all of the details, and I am scared to ask. We are in marriage counseling now. \n\nThings are going okay, but I don't trust her. Today, at the advice of our marriage counselor, I saw a psychiatrist. I unloaded all of these demons. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I have been having more chest pains since I found out about the second affair. Turns out those are panic attacks. I'm going to start therapy for myself to work on these problems. To come to terms with my demons. Trying to repair the damage I have done to my marriage, my wife, my children. I've never been physical abusive, but emotional abuse hurts worse. This is my story, but it isn't who I am.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

My friend is a very anxious person and is on lots of medication to get through his everyday life. Last sunday we were hanging out and we were watching youtube videos. He saw my watch history when looking something up and got really startled. While he was sleeping, I was stoned and watching weird stuff on youtube. I'd previously had a flashback about roadkill, so I looked up a video about hamsters getting squished. When he saw this he voiced that he was very disturbed. He gathered himself and he suggested we go to the living room. I was sitting there chilling while he went outside talking to his dad for quite some time. About 20 minutes or so. After the conversation was over, his dad came back and said \"hey he is getting really anxious now, you should probably go home.\" So I said alright, and I went home. The next day he messages me just like usual. He messaged me this funny clip of a homemade jackass skit. I then replied and asked if he was okay from sunday, with a reply of \"no\". I aplogized for making him anxious. Later on, I messaged him a couple more things, things I normally send him that he likes. A clip from a cheech and chong movie and another saying it was 4:44 pm meaning all is well. After I sent that 4:44 message he blocked me on everything. I reached out to his friends and family and his dad told me that he was a little freaked out about the whole hamster thing and to give it time. I understand that I must give things time here, but in my thinking I think that is a bit extreme. He was my only true friend I had so now I kind of have been feeling empty in his absense.

If I jump everywhere I'm sorry. I can't stop thinking about this and I just need somewhere to vent.\n\nSo I've been in this particular friend group for 3 years and I feel like I'm no longer included. We all met in band class and clicked really well. Everything has been fine until the start of this school year. Most of my friends switched to a different school and I was stuck at our old sucky school. I hated our old school and eventually convinced my parents to let me go to the public school. I joined and everything was going great for the first few months. \n\n It all seemed perfect until my friend Caleb had sex with a chick in our friend group. Caleb started to change rapidly after this. He started to brag about it all the time and would start to go out with random chicks then brag about fucking them. He then started to hang out with senior kids and pretend like he's a senior. He's now going to prom even though he's a sophomore. Obviously I'm not good friends with him anymore because it feels like he's not the same guy I met a year ago. \n\n Along with this my friend Tay started to talk with this new set of kids. There was close to no change at first and everything was fine until he started to get annoying. He was becoming more aggressive ( pushing me, tackling me, ect.) And would start conversations out normally but would later become verbally abusive to me then just saying it was a joke. \n\nEveryone else in the friendgroup has for the most part stayed the same and I still love them, but I feel excluded when I hang out. They'll have side conversations that I can't join in on because it's something I don't know about (as in cars, other friend groups, senior classes ect.) Or it's a secret I'm not allowed to know ( mainly tay and caleb do this). I talked to one friend about this and he feels the same. He says he sometimes feels left out of conversation or is just straight out ignored. I talked to Tay about this too and he seems to think it's all my fault and that I'm not willing to talk.\n\nIdk if anything I've said has made sense because it feels like I'm just typing random shit out at 10:00 pm but if anyone can help me just figure out how to feel like they're my friends again I'd gladly appreciate it.

I just started up ukulele a couple months back, but I'm better at it than guitar. Im hoping to get better in the future. Practice makes perfect! \n\n- Music is a huge part of my life. I'm listening to something almost 24/7.

I've never enjoyed anyone's company, never looked forward to seeing anyone, never experienced the feeling of \"missing\" anyone, never yearned for companionship etc. Friendships are nothing but a major annoyance in my life. Whether we see each other once a week or once a year, they make me miserable, and make me feel as if I'm a circus monkey for someone else's entertainment, or a hostage being held captive. I know I sound like a raging asshole, but this is just how my brain is wired. I don't hate people, I just hate it when they're part of my life.   \n\nThankfully over the years most of my friendships have died out naturally as we've moved away for college and such, however at 23 I still have one who keeps hanging on. \n\nI feel badly for her- she's socially awkward so I'm pretty much the only friend she has, and I know she feels rather lonely. But I just... can't do this anymore. It's come to the point where I've on more than one occasion broken down in tears after getting a text from her because I just so desperately want to be left alone. I feel so much built-up resentment toward her for \"bothering me\" (not saying I'm right to feel this way, it's just how I feel) that I'm genuinely worried that one day I'll snap and scream at her to leave me the fuck alone. \n\nI want her out of my life forever, but I don't want to leave her devastated. On the one hand, I feel like I ought to just suck it up and carry on playing the role of \"friend\" in silent misery, but on the other hand I sometimes feel like she's needlessly wasting her time on me, and that it's not fair to keep her dependent on me as her go-to gal-pal and in doing so prevent her from pushing herself to go out and meet someone who is genuinely invested in having a healthy, caring, reciprocal friendship. Like ripping off a band-aid-- it'll hurt at first, but it's what's best in the long run, right? \n\nI've seen a lot of people talk about how hurtful failed friendships can be, but that's a sentiment I flat out do not comprehend, so I'm in desperate need of advice as to how to go about this, or, as I mentioned above, if I even should even broach it at all...?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I wanted to let it out and get any insight if possible. So i have been friends with this person for two and a half years, it was one of the toughest friendships i have ever made. Our first year of friendship consisted of my friend picking on the smallest things of my behavior (why i lock my door when i sleep/why i buy certain products/why i talk a certain why) and would have huge fights with me over it (asking me to change) we fought so much and every time i swear it was because of something about me that she did not approve of/like..i kept compromising and trying to change but after a year of fights i got exhausted and i told her that i wont change myself anymore and she has to accept me like I am. Anyway we thankfully stopped living together after that year (we were college dorm roommates) and things got better since she was not in my face 24/7 picking on everything i do..but this one thing remained that annoyed me is that i was constantly the person asking her to do stuff and she would almost always cancel on me for all kinds of excuses and then promise to make it up and never does or sometimes she would hype me up about going out and i would plan it only for her to bail at the last minute..it happened so many times i felt stupid for keeping on inviting her so at some point i stopped but then she got mad at me because i stopped inviting her..confused the shit out of me..this year i just like stopped inviting her as much but lately i told her about a trip that meant so much to me and she hyped me up about it and asked me to go ahead and purchase the tickets for me and her and so i did...only for her to bail on the trip literally a day before the trip (and asked me to give her ticket money back although at that point i could not get a refund because it had been two months since i purchased the tickets) so basically i gave her the money back although it really was my money..i was not upset about the money i just hated how she bailed out for (the 1000th time?) but this time on something that she hyped me up for so much and knew how much it meant to me and the excusd she gave me was just nonsenese.what i cant figure out is what happened to me since then: i just lost all interest in her as a friends i completely stopped caring for her or about her i cant bring myself to talk to her i stopped thinking about hanging out with her or seeing her and i even find myself compeletey avoiding her and when i see her i just feel nothing towards her as a friend anymore and i just have the shortest conversation possible and i make an excuse to go..it has been almost a month with me just not caring for her anymore whatsoever it is like a switch inside of me got turned off completely..but i feel guilty because she is graduating in a month and that probably would be the last month i will ever see her i think..i just would feel guilty if i just completely disappear from her life after all time of \u201cfriendship\u201d but at the same time the switch got turned off so badly that i realllllly dont want to talk to her like i just dont want to be her friend anymore ever again", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

When we first entered secondary school, is when our differences and personalities really became apparent. I was awkward and nerdy, but i played sports and nobody really messed with me much; i had a good experience. He was quite opposite, always the joker and class clown. He was the one with charisma, and when he hit his growth spurt and started working out he really came into his own. We had our fallings out and such(i may have been a touch jealous, but he also let his head swell greatly), and come through them. Fast forward to now, we've managed to end up in the same city for uni and we live together. We've always been able to discuss things rationally and i have a high level of respect for him which, in recent times, seems not to be reciprocated.\n\nIn terms of similarities, neither of us are highly emotional but we do trust each other. There has always been a rivalry of sorts between us, whether it be pool, poker, dominoes, boxing, school, you name it. Its always close and we have alot of fun. Here's where my concerns come in, please bear with me lol:\n\n1. When i didn't do that well on my A-levels (still good i think, but disappointing), he got a scholarship (all A's).\n2. The one thing we have had wildly different experience with is girls. I was a virgin until 2nd year uni, hes always been  \npopular.\n3. He prefers to be around people all the time, i like being by myself in between spending time with my friends. He believes that without him there i wouldnt have been able to make friends in a new city. May or may not be true but thats no reason to look down on someone anyways.\n\nDue to things like this, he's always trying to give me advice and telling me how i need to be more open and \"the only way to *improve* is to practise\". The most vivid and hurtful memory was last summer after 1st year when he said he has no respect for me during our normal ribbing in the group chat. Nobody corrected him and he offered no further comment. At that point, i knew that there's some truth to any joke anyways. He didn't respect me. That honestly hurt a little bit, which is quite rare for me. Anyways, i didn't say anything but i steeled myself. I had some work to do, for my own good mainly. Fast forward through that summer and i really put myself out there, and i had alot more interactions with people, it was a great summer for me. After that he even acknowledged improvement, but i still had no luck with girls so i had no experience. All the time when we're out and girls show interest he says, \"She likes you yknow you should do something, you need to get experience\". I always say im not attracted to her what do you expect? One day i ask him if he would be interested, if the same girls liked him, he says nah but hes not me. Huh, thats weird. Finally, he always knows exactly whats good about himself, but would be hard pressed to come up with something to say about me.\n\nThese things seem small, but i cannot remember every little clue,and its the culmination of everything which stings. I've come to realise that we are just different and he comes across as a bit of a narcissist actually. I've told him that many times, just to bring it to his attention, but either he doesnt agree or doesnt see a downside to it. Am i thinking too much about this? Should i try to bring this up again?\n\nTL;DR : Someone i have great respect for, thinks of me as a lowly commoner:)", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Oh **animals**. I am also Christian.

I Don't swear. Talk about anything sexual, watch r rated movies... drink alcohol, smoke and have never touched any illegal substances. I know this makes me boring to most people but I hope someone out there might like to talk with me.\n\nJust want a friend who has time to voice chat sometimes, but has to be someone appropriate. Most of all, someone who has time. Please know, **I am not after help or \"someone to listen\"** I really just want a friend to talk to sometimes. Maybe about games or toys or lego or pokemon, and someone who will message me. As sometimes messaging others is hard for me.

I live with my long term boyfriend, our (almost) 2 year old son, and our dog. We've been here 4 years this summer, and I've made zero friends. \n\nAll of my highschool friends have drifted apart, and I  don't talk to  the few people I was friendly with from jobs I've had here any more. \n\nI'm pretty severely depressed, with severe anxiety and mild OCD to top it off.

They were activities that you'd want to go to with friends you already have. \n\nI used to be happier. I feel like I've always had this dark cloud over my head, but it's gotten worse over the years. I miss who I used to be. I don't want to be sad and anxious 24/7, and I'm trying to work on it. I miss seeing people, having friends, being goofy with people and enjoying things.

She is currently seeing someone, but he seems to be pulling away and I don't see it working out, unfortunately.\n\nShe and I commiserated over our dating struggles before I met my partner, but nowadays it is ALL she will talk about. Even though she's certainly not the only one of her/our friends who is single, she is getting herself super worked-up over everything and says that she can't and won't be happy until she's in a relationship. I totally understand her mindset because I was like that too, but I've done all that I can to express that this is a super unhealthy view to have and she refuses to go and see a counselor. I've told her all about my positive experiences with seeing a counselor when I was single and going through a rough time, but I just can't get through to her that this would help. She even said that seeing a counselor \"takes time\" and that she doesn't \"want to wait to find a relationship\"...even though those are two mutually exclusive things. Plus, the fact that she's getting herself so worked up over this no doubt comes across to potential dates as being intense and clingy. (Btw, she has great health insurance and makes decent money so cost isn't an issue in seeing a counselor.)  She also gets EXTREMELY triggered when seeing ANY pictures on social media of people in relationships or wedding photos, yet for some reason keeps looking at them and then messages me while having a breakdown about it. She's super competitive and if anyone has any success in life (relationship or otherwise), she sees it as a personal failure on her part if she doesn't have that thing/accomplishment too. She owns a house and has a fantastic job, so she's not \"behind\" in life by any means.\n\nI can't keep being her \"therapist\" and I don't know what else I can say to help her that I haven't already said.

So, I\u2019m freaking out and I don\u2019t know what to do. I have about thirty minutes before an important interview so I need to at least vent before I freak the fuck out. \n\nI\u2019m able to go to college because I\u2019m in my university\u2019s honors and I have my tuition paid for, and both are dependent on GPA.\n\nThis semester I\u2019ve fucked up bad. About halfway through, I had some mental health problems (mainly with anxiety and depression) where I struggled going to class and had to see a new therapist. \n\nMy grades are shit. \n\nIn one class I have a 100 in every assignment, but have missed 6 classes; the limit you could miss is 4. I can now absolutely not finish with an A.\n\nIn another, we have a participation grade that I\u2019m certainly going to fail, I\u2019ve missed two quizzes, and I have a C average on the exams. I\u2019m certainly not getting an A or B in this. \n\nIn another, I have a 96% test average and 92% quiz average, but attendance is 45% of our grade and I\u2019m again likely to have a B as my final grade. \n\nThree of my five classes are going to be C or B, and that takes my GPA both out of honors and my tuition. \n\nI am not saying that these things are anyone\u2019s fault but my own. I know I should have gone to class, and that these issues are the result of **my** failings. \n\nI\u2019m not asking for a way to fix my grades, because I know I can\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m asking how I can calm down, how I can not feel like the world has ended, and how I can not hate myself. \n\nThese are mistakes I won\u2019t make again, but I very much feel like that won\u2019t even matter anyway.

{"post_id": "bc4adu", "created_utc": 1555012185, "title": "Am I being a bad friend?", "author": "Calita22", "self_text": "Hello people. Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'm 29f and I met my friend (31m) around 5 years ago. We would mostly text because we live in different countries but we have met in person a couple of times. When we started talking I was already in a relationship with the man who is now my husband. I told him right away that I was in a serious relationship and that all I could offer was a friendship, he was fine with it and we became friends. With time he also became friends with my husband, we became friends with a friend of his too. Both of them came to our wedding. We introduced them to our family and friends here, etc.\nSo my friend (let's call him Paul) has a gf now. Since they are together (around 2 years) he has messaged me lots of times feeling really bad about things she has done to him. I won't get into details so that I don't make this even longer but she is very abusive, lies to him, yells at him for no reason, etc. As a friend I would listen to him and try to give him advise but he would just ignore it. He also told me a couple of times that his gf didn't like me and was jealous of me.\nSo some months ago my husband and I planned on visiting Paul and his friend for a few days and he got really excited when I told him about our visit. He even wanted to take days off of work to hang out with us and kept telling me about places he wanted to take us to and all. \nBut when the date got near his attitude changed completely. He would barely answer to my messages, he started suggesting things me and my husband could do on our own and one day he told me that he was worried that his gf and I were not going to get along. I apologized for anything I could have said to make him feel that way and told him not to worry, that even though I didn't like some of the thing she had done to him he was my friend and I knew that she was important to him so I was going to do my best.\nSo when we got there.. I'm an extremely shy person but I did my best and she seemed really nice. I actually liked her. We didn't get to see them much but when we did she was very nice, would talk and smile at me a lot. We saw them a couple of times during those days and I told her both times that it had been really nice to meet her. I thought everything was good but when we got back Paul messaged me and told me his gf had been yelling at him the whole time we were there because she didn't want him to see me and that she had told him to stop being my friend. She also told him that I was rude and mean because I never said it had been nice meeting her (it's a pretty stupid reason to say someone is rude and mean but in any case it wasn't true) so he told me he had to stop talking to me to save his relationship. He messaged me again 2 days later saying he was sorry, told me they were done and that he had realized how abusive she was. According to what he told me she didn't even want him to talk with his family and a lot of other crazy things. He seemed so crushed that I forgave him. He told me he was going to talk to her the next day and I warned him that she was going to make up some lie to make him stay with her. He said she could say whatever she wanted but he was done with her.. guess what happened... \nSo after all that for a while he would only message me when he was at work or when he was allowed to go out with friends and he would also have to delete our conversations every time we talked. I told him I wasn't comfortable with that but he said it was the only way we could still talk. He wanted me to message his girlfriend to \"make things good between us\" to which I refused. He told me many times that I'm his best friend and that he didn't want to lose me so I told him if he really cared about our friendship he would have to talk to her and stand up for it but he said he couldn't do it after what his gf had gone through (he never told me what that was but it's about the lie she made up to make him stay with her)\nI felt really bad during all this time but I tried to be strong because I know this won't end well for him and he is going to need a friend sooner or later. But some weeks ago another good friend of mine got really sick, thank God she is a little better now but at that time everyone thought she wasn't going to make it. I was devasted and when he heard of it he told me he was really sorry to hear that but that he couldn't be there for me as my friend because he had to take care of his relationship. I was very sad and maybe particularly sensitive because of that situation. I felt that was such a cruel thing to say that I told him I was done with him and that I was going to focus on the people who actually cared about me. His answer to that was \"I have to go now. have a nice weekend\" he tried to message me a few days after that when his gf wasnt around like nothing happend, he didn't even apologized and I never replied. \nI feel awful. I don't know what to do. One part of me is angry and hurt by all this and the other thinks it's all my fault and that I'm a terrible friend but I don't know what did I do\nThanks again for reading", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, Star Wars, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Game of Thrones, The Handmaid's Tale, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel.

But I regret too many other things to care, so here it goes. \n\n* I'm an 18 year old gay guy from somewhere in eastern Europe, getting ready to leave this place but idk how I'm gonna live after that tbh\n\n* I get distracted by pretty much everything so I just have a few things that I do all the time and a bunch of other stuff that I'd be interested in and that I'd want to do more (or just do at all I guess)\n\n* I spend waaaayyyyy too much time watching random youtube videos and lurking on reddit \n\n* I play the sims more than I should, always did\n\n* I don't really play video games too much, just never got to play them a lot, at least not the cool gaming stuff\n\n* Music is cool, even though my tastes aren't so interesting tbh, but I'll listen to most things \n\n* I'm kinda interested in dreams/sleep, languages, history and worldbuilding and I've been wanting to read more, even though I haven't spent too much time on these\n\nThis is probably getting pretty long already, so I'll stop here for now. If you read this and you'd want to talk then send me a message (please no chat messages tho, I can't see them on my phone and I don't want to accidentally ghost any of you because of that) and tell me a bit about you. Have a great day and I hope I'll talk to you soon!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I had also planned for us to go to laser blaze on a later date but suddenly they all got busy and can't make it that day and of course they do it when I can't come I tried suggesting weekends and other days and then my cheap friend was like but if we go on those days it costs $1 more and also said \"weekends are megagay\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey are also continually mocking me for no reason mostly on stuff that isn't true, during school I take my mouse and headphones to school and they're constantly pushing my hinge further than it's meant to go weakening it and constantly pulling out my mouse and trying to damage it than laughing and not letting me do my work, I don't really want to tell on them, one time during health one of my friends signed me up on my school email for a bunch of spam and things and I didn't tell on him just told him don't do it again but then I literally type his email on a word document during computer science and him tells the teacher I didn't even know if it was his email I just typed his first name and last name and asked him he said no but the moment I saved the document he told the teacher. This is also the same annoying friend that isn't really a friend he's the extremely arrogant one that was the latest addition to our friend group, the way he joined was he didn't really have any friends so one day I decided to go and sit with him that was one of my biggest mistakes ever since then he's been annoying our friend group for a really long time but recently when he's only been annoying me he's become more popular among my friend group and they are starting to choose him over me for no decent reason even though he just loves to start arguments. In hass for a project we luckily got to use Minecraft now I hadn't purchased java edition cuz well I used to play it on my Xbox like a few years ago and also we're not little kids anymore to be playing Minecraft all day but then when he learnt I didn't have a java edition all of my friends forced me to buy it for the project saying that if I didn't I would be contributing absolutely nothing even though the annoying person can't even run minecraft at home or join the server due to his extremely bad 0.4megabits per second internet.

Seems like she doesn't want to spend an entire week with me which is fine I just don't understand why she made such a big thing about her visiting if they didn't want to spend much time with me.\n\nThey are clearly visiting the city and not me.\n\nAnyone else been in this situation ?

After few minutes they called me saying I should come out (also I was in vacation for a week so this would be my first day meeting them after vacation) and they said that I should meet them at one place. After I got there, they weren't there anymore and they had turned off their snapmaps. So I called them and they responded after a few minutes saying that they we're in a place that's 3km away from meeting place. I didn't believe them because they wouldn't go there. After few minutes of arguing by trying to make them say where they actually are they said that they were in the place thats 3km away. So i believed them and I went there. They weren't there so I called them asking to cut the sh*t and tell me where they are and they said around the corner but actually they weren't. So in the call there we're some other people that aren't in our friends group.

We've become a really tight group who sit together at lectures and hang out all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs is normal in groups of this size, I became a bit closer to two of the people, a guy and a girl. The girl, 21F, moved here from another part of the country to go to her dream school and get her dream education (this university is the only place you can study what we study in the country).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 of our friend group (me and the girl included) failed one of our first exams. It's really not unusual to fail an exam here (24% failed), but we were a bit startled. Our next exam, me and the other person who failed passed but my good friend failed again. She didn't take it that well and began talking about how stupid she is. I'd like to add that she is, in no way, stupid. We've now had 5 exams and she's passed 3 of them in a very demanding university. I think she's probably just been stressed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe only just had our 6th exam and it's one that most of the older students say is easy. I did find it a bit more difficult than the recent years' exams, but it was okay. She found it a bit difficult as well, but she says she thinks it went okay. The only thing that worries me is that she said \"if I don't pass this one, it's just proof I'm too stupid to go here\". She sounded completely serious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter this statement, she's started to pull away from our friend group. She's gotten an apartment a bit away from the city (not part of the problem, she really needed to move away because where she lived was absolutely terrible) but now she's saying that because she lives an hour away from the city (same as I do), she can't party with us anymore. She's also cancelled her fitness, a thing four of us used to do together. And she's said no to go to a festival all of us are going to. She's basically pulling away from our shared activities and it's beginning to worry me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think that she's preparing to drop out and move away again. I really, really don't want her to go, not just because I really like her, but also because I know that this is her dream job and I think it would be a shame if she gave up. I know that she's smart enough to make it through, I just think it's a matter of figuring out how to adapt her study methods to the new exam forms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut what should I do? Can I do anything to convince her to give it time and not see her to fails as a stamp that she's not good enough? I just really want her to give it more time and start believing in herself again because I think she's completely lost her motivation and the fact that she's not pulling away from socialization is worrying me.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Everybody liked her, she had the same energy as my friends, etc. My new girlfriend is calmer, is just on another level and doesn\u2019t have the same sense of humor and habits (drinking and eating exessive and unhealthy, especially during meetups / parties). \nAs a result, I tend to be less outgoing, healthier, less \u2018toxic\u2019 and a bit more introvert too, which suits me, except for the fact that I occassionaly do like a wild party with a bit of childish behavior. When I am around with my friends, it always feels a bit like vacation. \n\nWe are all around 30 years old, and my friends seem to have the problem that they don\u2019t want to change and to grow and accept that lifes and people are changing. Life is a bit more dull, I give them that. But the times have changed. I want to be more responsible, be more in control of my life.\n\nIs it normal and acceptable behavior of my friends to communicate this \u2018bomb\u2019? I really don\u2019t know what to think of it. It feels like they split us in two camps: that I have to choose between friends or my girlfriend, which I obviousy don\u2019t want. I also would like to point out that I don\u2019t have any connection with some of the girlfriends from my friends (the basis of the group of friends). But instead of dropping a bomb, I accept them.

He says the n-word and sends racially insensitive 'memes' and what not. She asked our friend group for advice and everyone told her it's her decision but she should dump him. We all thought she'd be the last person to put up with racism, a genuine ally. She didn't split with him, she's currently debating it but in my eyes/most of our friends eyes i/we don't see anything to debate. Now i'm uncomfortable around her, i have told her my opinions and obviously at the end of the day it is her decision - i'm just feeling kinda lost on what i should do. Do i try to move past her dating a racist or do i create distance between us?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore info on their relationship: They've only been dating 6 months, in this time they have split and gotten back together (around 2 months ago). She used to tell me he was not supportive and kinda boring/lazy with organising dates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would totally get debating it if they were soul mates and a substantial amount of time and energy had been invested into the relationship - but from what she has told me their hasn't been... so i'm not sure why she is still with him even without the racism. He's a shit boyfriend in general. On top of that he's a racist. Her main reason is that he took the break up badly the first time and to that i said \"racist's don't deserve their feelings spared\", she shouldn't be with him solely for the fact he might be hurt if she breaks up with him...

Bob and I have been friends for a little over 12 years. I met him back when I was first descending into what has turned into years of depression and self hate, he was in the same boat so we clicked. For the first five years our friendship was great, we talked often about serious things, spent hours gaming, and would get each other out of our bad episodes. It was around then he started acting weird, but it turned out he had a girlfriend so alright, figured he was making something for himself so I was fine with less contact.\n\nFast forward to now. He's on his...eighth girlfriend, I think. The guy tends to go through two a year at this point, and spends the intervening periods flirting with self harm and at least one suicide attempt. He's become very vengeful towards all of them, to where he's stalked a few for a year or more both on here and irl. I think he's going into the relationships expecting an emotional slave and not a partner, and having talked to a few of these girls the majority care about him and then end up in a similar emotional state to him at the end of it. I've been in two relationships like this so a part of me would really like to deck him for doing it. Trying to point the wrongness of his actions out to him in a roundabout way never ends well. Honestly he seemed far happier when single but what do I know, right?\n\nWhere my problem with him comes in is that for four years now I've felt like I'm only kept around as someone to sound things off of. While I do still worry about him, getting walls of text is now worrisome as my replies must be worded just right or I'm the bad guy. Of course when the opposite is the case, it's totally fine to bash me and I'm an asshole or over sensitive if I call him on it. As of two days ago he once again took something I said wrong and canned me on the gaming forum we use, but this time I've also been deleted off social media and the few non-gaming groups we were in. My urge is to block and forget him this time, but Bob is just nuts enough this might cause drama.

So, my friend group is all 16 and we're sophomores in high school. We've been best friends for 5 years. At the beginning of this school year, we were pretty strong, stronger than we've ever been due to losing a toxic member, but it all came tumbling downhill in October 2018. We should start with some background, this goes back a few years.\n\nSo in 8th grade, my best friend, we'll call her Sarah, had a boyfriend and one day he brought his best friend over, we'll call him Tanner, and it was lust at first sight. I was so incredibly into him. (this was around January 2017) His birthday is in February and I begged Sarah to give me his number. His birthday was a perfect excuse to text him and start a conversation. So we did, and we were \"talking\" since then all the way until the end-ish March, so only about a month, but he was literally so perfect. I pictured him as my first boyfriend, my first kiss, him meeting my parents, and everything. I know we were only like 14, but he was becoming one of my best friends. The week before spring break, Sarah went out of town because a family member died so she wasn't there. This is kind of important because I turned to Tanner instead of her, which was a pivot in our friendship/talking-ship? (I don't even know what you'd call it). My niece was born in the middle of March and Sarah was busy being with her family during a difficult time. We talked about everything that night, and I mean everything. What we wanted in life, what our childhoods were like, the shitty things we've been through, literally everything. I felt more connected to him that I was to anyone. And I had \"things\" with other guys, but they were obviously not that serious (except for one other, but that's not that important... yet). My sister-in-law was in labor for so long, so the entire time I was at that hospital, I would walk down to the parking lot or to another floor (so my parents could't hear) Every half hour and we'd talk on the phone, and then my mom would tell me to come back up and we'd text. For 24 hours, he stayed up with me so I wouldn't be alone and we just talked. Around this time was the school dance and rumors that he was going to ask me were flying up everywhere. Sarah talked about it, her boyfriend talked about it, some adjacent friends talked about it. We even had a ship name that people would say around us and it'd just make us laugh. I was genuinely so happy.  On Monday, he completely avoided my texts, avoided me at school, and even avoided our friends. I started getting so worried. On Wednesday, I called Sarah crying because I hadn't heard or seen him in days and it was really freaking me out and she said, \"Oh, he hasn't told you yet? Yeah, he's not into you anymore.\" And even though I had only been talking to him for a month, my heart shattered so much. I felt like he jut fell off the face of the earth, it was so sudden. After months of the feelings I had for him kind of wearing off, he texted me a huge paragraph explaining how sorry he was. I forgave him, and that entire summer, we talked every single day, all day. He was my best friend. We'd listen to music together all day over the phone, we'd laugh, and we'd fall asleep on face time. We stayed like this until November of 2017. I had never lost all feelings for him and they grew so much. I know this might be a little controversial, but from what I knew of love, I loved him. So that's it for background, now let's go to the actual story.\n\nNovember of 2017, Sarah got dumped by her boyfriend and I was out of service for a week, so I wasn't able to be there to comfort her. When I got back from camping, she told me that she was going to go after Tanner and that she wants him now. She for sure knew how I felt about him, so we got into a big blow out. Tanner and I were still okay, but he had a girlfriend at this time (she treated him like garbage. cheated on him twice, probably more) so I didn't think that he would go for her, but then he did. In January of 2018, he broke up with his girlfriend and then started talking to Sarah. My heart was broken because no matter how much I told Sarah that it was hurting me, that he could have anyone she wanted besides him, she didn't care. She told me I was being a horrible friend and I was standing in the way of her happiness. So I stopped trying and was just hurting to myself. I luckily had the shoulder of another best friend (we'll call her Hailey) so I wasn't completely alone. Not long after, Sarah went back to her old boyfriend and I was kinda pissed because what was that whole thing for? but I was also kind of happy because our feud was over and me and Tanner became super close again. In May, Sarah got dumped by that guy again and she went crawling back to Tanner, which he did not let her back in with open arms. He found her annoying an two-faced and was hell-bent on showing her that what she did to him, going back and forth between the old boyfriend and him was not okay. But then for some reason, out of no where, I saw them hanging out all the time and she would say \"Did tanner tell you...\" or \"Isn't funny when Tanner...\" and I didn't have answers because Tanner was basically leaving me, but it was slow, like I could tell it was happening, but it was definitely gradual. All summer, we didn't really speak and it hurt like hell. He was my best friend, he knew everything about me. In October, they started dating. Don't forget, I liked him this entire time, but Sarah truly just didn't care. So for six months, we've been not the same, there's always this big elephant in the room. When they started dating, Tanner completely shut me out of his life and I never got an explanation. It hurt so badly. I was so alone. I was pissed at Sarah and he just vanished out of my life, and for months, I was alone. When I got my car, I started to hang out with Hailey more and we're so close now. Sarah is extremely jealous and says I never hang out with her anymore. But I can't even be in the same room as Tanner because I burst into tears thinking about the connection we had and how it's all gone now, so it's hard to hang out with her when they're always together. And recently, I feel like she's been pushing him on me. Like for instance, my friend group sits in the same spot every single day. On Mondays and Wednesdays, Sarah sits with us. So I go to walk into where we sit (it's in  teacher's classroom of whom we're very close to) and before I open the door, I see through the window that he's in there. I run! out of the halls and throw away my lunch before I had been able to eat it. I told them I was on my way and I wasn't even warned by anyone that he was in there. He refused to leave, told me I could just come in there and be mature, and Sarah agreed with him. Hailey chased after me after I ran away and told me that she didn't mind that he was in there, as long as he agreed t leave when I was on my way. Savannah lied and told me she told him to go and everyone else told him to stay... yeah, I know, sucky. I was so pissed, livid actually. I get so upset around him and now I get mad, my blood boils. He treated me like crap. It sucks even more that my best friend knows I cried myself to sleep for weeks because of what he did to me and she can still love him. So I started getting closer to Hailey, and three other best friends (we're calling them Jordyn, Olive, and Ophelia.... what? I'm reading Hamlet right now). Jordyn and Hailey are best friends, but Hailey and I have been getting closer, and Sarah leans on Jordyn. Sarah is hella jealous of me and Hailey getting closer, but I tell her she has nothing to worry about. On Sarah's birthday party (literally yesterday) I was at Sarah's house getting ready and Tanner show up early. Now, Sarah's mom knows the situation, so when even though i was ready, when Sarah asked where I was, her mom told her I was still getting ready. Sarah sat me and her other best friend right beside her and out of respect for me, put Tanner all the way across the table, which I was kind of okay with. It's her party, I wasn't going to tell her what to do. But not even ten minutes after we've all sat down, he comes over and starts hanging all around her right. next. to. me... I told hailey that I had to pee, but I walked out of the room and as soon as no one could see me, I started crying (and I never cry in front of anyone) but then her mom came and hugged me and told me that everything was going to be okay, that it's only a few more hours and he'll be gone. I went to the bathrrom and two of my friends followed me, Ophelia and Olive. I let Olive in and basically told Ophelia to go (I'm not as close with her and I didn't want her to see me cry) and Olive helped me clean my face and calm me down. The Sarah noticed I was gone and came in, but wasn't sympathetic at all. she actually seemed pissed that I was taking away from her day. Mind you, I did not make a scene. I said I had to pee!\n\nQuick background for the next part. Hailey had this ex and when he was talking to two other girls, on of which he was asking for nudes for and the other he's dating now, we were obviously all there for her. For a while, it came up in every conversation and most of us didn't really mind, but Sarah felt the need to tell her that she talks about it too much and she needs to get over it. So Hailey and Sarah are not really that close anymore.\n\nNot long after the thing with me, Hailey started to cry because two guests at the party were best friends with her ex and they would look at her, laugh, then type on their phones, obviously talking about her, and when she passed them, one said to the other \"she's just so f---ing stupid\" which made her cry and it wasn't a scene at all, I didn't even notice until later. When I went out there, she was calmed down and we started listening to throwback Justin Beiber. There were people outside and people inside still taking pictures, so it wasn't like we were the only ones outside. then this girl who we barely know comes and tells us Sarah is pissed that we're starting drama. We didn't start shit. we were fine. So then I walked up to sarah and told her that everything was fine, everyone is civil, and that we're all there for her and no one else. So I thought everything was fine... nope.\n\nHailey texts me late tonight and tells me through out the entire party, she was texting her other best friend (calling her Piper) and telling her that she's so pissed at us for stealing away from her night, that we're horrible friends to her, and she's going to tough it out until the end of the school year and then leave us so she's not alone??? (sarah told all of this to Jordyn who is again, best friends with Hailey, and so of course, Jordyn told hailey and then Hailey decided to tell me because my name was also thrown in there. and she's my best friend talking shit about me...) Hailey is saying at lunch tomorrow \"I'm just going to say, if someone isn't happy in this friend group and is only using the others so they aren't alone, then you can leave.\" That way it's targeted towards her, but other people in our group who don't know what was said to Jordyn don't know it's her.\n\nWe are all honestly so confused because we're all tired of Savannah's shit. But, I've been best friends with her since 6th grade, so not having her there would take a serious toll on me. But I don't trust her anymore. And it sucks. I love her, and I know this sounds horrible, but I don't like her. She's conceded, shallow, narcissistic, selfish, judgmental, and critical.  I just don't know what to do and getting advice from someone else would really help us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you read this entire thing, thank you so much!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

These were the type of friends who wouldn\u2019t talk to you for three months if you couldn\u2019t go to an event they hosted.\n\nWhen we left school(18yrs) I started to feel obligated to hang out with them with no desire to actually go, it made me miserable!

Talk most days, sometimes on the phone for hours. If I hang out with her alone it's fine but if anyone else is with us she'll often either make fun of me or start telling the other person about embarrassing things I've done. For the most part I can take it for friendly banter or whatever but at times it really annoys me because I don't do the same to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn example of this is if we get high she tries to say that I'm more high than I actually am. I know this because I've been a daily smoker for a long time so I don't actually get as high as I'd like. But she'll keep saying \"oh you look so high\" or \"your eyes are so red man\" etc. It's always an attempt to embarrass me in front of the other person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite not being posh I have a posh souding middle name which I've shortened but she loves telling people the full version. A few days ago she wanted to play this game called M.A.S.H. She asked me questions where I had to pick 5 jobs, 5 boys names, 5 girls names etc. But the first question was 5 people I'd want to have sex with. I felt uncomfortable answering but she kept pressuring me. I picked some famous people but she said I had to pick people I knew in real life. Everyone I picked she looked up on social media &amp; judged them or showed the other person I was with. Then she tried adding someone I sort of fancied a few years ago &amp; when I said I didn't like that person that way anymore she kept going on about it &amp; telling the friend we were with about who the person was and how she was way older than me. Anyway the thing that really annoyed me is that after my turn was over everyone else picked fictional people and nobody else got interrogated for their choices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA final example is I shared an animation a friend of mine made &amp; said something along the lines of \"My G \\*animators name\\*....\" and she commented on the post for everyone to see slagging the words I used like G even though we use that word with each other all the time. She said in the comment that she was actually embarrassed for me for talking like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I want to say that our friendship is endgame. I cannot imagine how my life would be if I didn' have her. Despite this she is &amp; always will be my friend but I know her well enough to know that if I confront her about this she won't take it seriously so I'm looking for advice I guess.

Details on the event:\n\n* Charity Ball open to anyone\n* Open Bar and Dinner Included\n* In the city, close to where we can both use public transportation\n* White Tie attire a must\n\nBecause I know money is tight, I told her I'd cover her ticket ($50). We've been looking for a formal event to go to for the experience for months, and most of the time they're either too expensive ($100-$1000s of dollars) or require membership of some sort with the hosting group or company. All she would need is to pay for her train ticket (we both would commute) and find (or have) a formal dress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, she's abit frosty that I haven't told her about the event sooner, as she works in retail and next week's schedule is probably already made. While I've also worked in retail in the past (I now have a full time company job), her ho-hum attitude is giving me a bad vibe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You should've told me weeks ago, this is too soon,\" she said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've explained I just found out about it today, and because it's short notice and I don't know what to expect, I was going to comp her ticket so it's not a loss for her if the event sucked. Plus, we may never get another opportunity to go to an event like this again in a while, and she usually says yes to events a week in advance or more.\n\nI even joked on how we can hit up a thrift store for dresses or the clearance rack, since I'm also not swimming in cash to shell out for a new fancy dress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I in the wrong? How should I handle this? Should I go alone?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Friend doesn't want to go to a Ball I found out about because a week in advance is too short notice, despite that I'm willing to comp her ticket and it's a rare social event for us both. Will update as it develops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATED: She got the day off, complained the entire week leading up to it, and then told me the day before she couldn't make it due to a 'family emergency' (found out it was a hookup) AFTER I PAID HER TICKET. Went with my other BFF instead, now she's shitposting about us being 'snobby c%$ts' for still going without her.\n\nBecause that's how ditching friends works....they don't go to the thing at all if you can't go.

In the last like three weeks she has started dating this guy, and now I feel like even though we hang out all the time I haven't hung out with her for a while. When we hang out, she almost always talks about him and like particulars of how she act or how she should text him etc. etc. My main issue is that she is constantly discussing the particulars of their relationship but literally there is no problem with this guy or their relationship yet. So part of me is annoyed that she is overthinking/trying to find issues with a perfect relationship (I'm like \"stop complaining about your perfect love interest\") and then also annoyed because we never talk about anything else.  Sometimes I even play a game where I see how many sentences we can go without talking about him. \n\nAlso it feels like she's always willing to ditch me to hang out with him which is sort of okay with me to some degree (like I get it) but also feels shitty sometimes.\n\nBUT my real concern is that my friend is extremely self-assured and confident in herself so I feel like if I tell her that she's doing this or ask if we can talk about him less she's just going to distance herself and we will grow further apart. Like she doesn't have enough self doubt to try and change her behavior, she would probably just decide to hang out more with people who will put up with her talking about it all the time.

I really do mean it. \n\nI've got some sort of story in addition to a simple question: am I the only one or are there people who experience similar situations out there? I don't know if this is the right subreddit to post this but currently I could really need a friend... Or just someone who listens... Or just someone at all. If it's not, I apologise in advance for the misunderstanding. Anyway I thank you the reader for reading. This does make sense right? ^^\n\nSo the story is:\nIt all began nine months ago, that one day I fell into an existential crisis for meaning and death. It struck me like lightning while arguing with a relative, that sudden realization that scientifically spoken, there can't logically be anything after life, at least as far as we know. This put me into some sort of kinda depressionistic state of \"no don't think about it, you currently exist, that's what matters\". Thinking about non existing still lets me feel uncomfortable, as I feel like throwing up. Not a good start to begin with. \nFour months ago, I got diagnosed with a pineal cyst, in case you don't know, that's a cyst inside some sort of gland in the brain, located quite in the centre of my head. Quite the bummer, nothing I'd die of now as far as I know, but it explains why I have such a headache all the time. It's not that big that the doctors think it's more of a risk to leave it inside my Body than to get it out, but it concerns me that there is a possibility that the cyst grows, therefore a possibility of getting operated in the head. Even a low possibility of dying of that thing. I already had one check up on it and it didn't grow, but the doctors want to keep it observated for the next year's.\nAnother side effect of this cyst I suffer through for a long time now is sleep disorders, that my neurologist gave me antidepressants against, which I currently take in very small dosis (far smaller than someone who actually is depressed would take it).\nI failed two of my exams in university and didn't do very well in all the others in contrary to a quite good career in school which is quite the bummer as well.\nI got friend zoned by my crush who currently ignores me without reason which is quite frustrating to the point where I just want to shout really mean things at her. Which is a problem cause we're colleagues in a side job I plan on doing parallel to the university and already work in for a year and a half. I work in a dancing school as assistant and she's an apprentice there for dance teacher. Which is quite unfortunate cause I have to work with her regardless of my current situation.\nAnd to top it all last week my last living grandparent died.\n\nIt just feels like I don't deserve happiness.

He talks about his crush and his job in detail and when people comment he goes back in forth, Our group of friends has tried to warn him of this. \n\nFor example, one day he went way to far and posted online about wanting to die or kill himself. I called him immediately and ask him if this was true and he said he felt like it but he had no plan and was \"too cowardly\" to do it. I told him that it is not okay to post things like this as someone may call the police and 51/50 him. He swore he would work on it be more careful about what he posts. i told him if he seriously felt this way or couldn't contract for his safety, we would be driving out to take him to the hospital immediately. He took it seriously, contracted for his safety apologized on social media and has not posted those types messages \n\nHowever, since he keeps posting things about how he hates his job giving way to many details that anyone coming across his page would know. He also tends to post every thought and feeling. I understand he is struggling with depression and anxiety. i do to and i know how it feels.however I decided i was not going to let it claim me and went to the doctors and therapist for assistance. I am guess I am just a high-functioning mental illness battler and he isn't. that sounds so bad but i feel like he can choose to fight it but he doesn\u2019t. I mean there are support groups, therapy, books, and other resources out there that could make even a small dent in it and help him grow stronger. I know his alot that went on with him as a kid and the string of exes that mistreated him, I can't blame him for that. However, he has a great paying job, which give him health insurance so he can get help but he puts it off. I get put off that he is complaining about his job and having to work overtime when I would kill for that opportunity. \n\nI am wondering if he is doing this for attention sometimes, as he is not taking steps to fix things. I tend to have a tough love sense of advice, which is unhelpful with him. What can do wit this? I don't want him to get himself in a situation we he shoots himself in the foot with a girl or his job. I do t want to hurt him and I know his journey is not my own. It\u2019s really hard to watch someone play with fire, get burned and go back to playing with fire. \n\nShould I just keep my mouth shut and be supportive and smile and nod?  I love him dearly and don\u2019t want to lose my friendship with him, nor do I want to do there and watch him crash and burn.

I've even put myself out there doing things that make me insanely anxious but with no results. I go to a few clubs, i attend college part time, but when it comes to meeting or talking to people I just... can't do it. I have panic attacks just sitting in class let alone try to talk to people...\n\nAll I want is some advice that isn't \"JUST TALK TO PEOPLE, JUST PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE\" cuz I can't sometimes, and the places I'm putting myself out into... I don't get anything back. Like I just don't know how people make those connections.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Then, I met a girl who changed everything for me, it was perfect, though as all things do for me- it eventually turned sour and we broke up. Some old friends reached out, I opened up and I realised how much friends could help me get through the darkness. I worked through the depression and built a friend circle- and once again, this was probably the happiest point of my life despite everything that'd recently happened, eventually that turned sour after my 'bestfriend' started struggling more with his anger management and flipped out, saying horrible things to me about my relationships that he knew would cut deep.\n\nIn the past year, I've lost countless friends and many people who I'd consider to be 'bestfriends', people who'd talk with me all day and all night, people who'd help me through the dark times as I'd help them through theirs, people who were always there, until they decided that they weren't anymore- typically because their attention got drawn to new friends after enough time, and partly because I'm probably doing something to make them want to leave.\n\nI'm not entirely sure why I'm here other than I'm desperate, I'm partly looking for some answers as to why everyone eventually gets bored of me, but mostly looking for someone who won't leave me.\n\nSo, a little bit about me-I've been told I'm a bit of a hopeless romantic at times, I'm going into my first official year of studying Computer Science at University (I had to do a placement/ foundation year for this past year- it's a long story I'd like to talk about if we talk :P), I'm big into a lot of things, very vast and unconnected, from Computers and Engineering to a particularly strange array of TV shows including (but not limited to) The Flash, The Vampire Diaries (I started watching it a while ago but lost track and recently picked it back up), Legacies (so sad that the first season was so short), Grey's Anatomy, The Umbrella Academy (I really didn't expect to like it but I've nearly binge watched the entire season today) and a lot more. My music taste isn't exactly limited to any genre, if I like it then I like it. The majority of my conversations with people I've enjoyed talking to typically foray into the deeper conversations around my life, their life, strange topics, anything that makes me curious or anything whoever I'm talking to is interested in, so don't be turned away by what I've listed, whatever you're interested in, I will very much like to learn about. I play games on my PC a little, however I've noticed I'm doing that a lot less nowadays as I just prefer to talk to people rather than be talking to people whilst also being distracted by a game.\n\nIf I'm at all of interest to you and you'd like to get to know me better, please feel free to reach out. I'm trying to be hopeful that eventually I'll find friends who's lives I fit in with. :)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

However, it\u2019s gotten pretty out of hand in the past year.\n\nShe experienced a loss in her family which resulted in her isolating herself, aside from her boyfriend, however, she seemed to be back to her normal self 6 months after the passing as she was able to spend some time catching up with me and another one of our best friends in our \u201cterrible trio\u201d.\n\nAbout a year has gone by and the other best friend in our group and I have noticed her becoming distant again, as we\u2019ve only seen her 2-3 times since then but only due to obligation for another wedding and by inviting ourselves over. She has expressed to her boyfriend that she feels hurt by us and that she feels we haven\u2019t been there for her, despite us sending multiple text messages checking in on her to see how she\u2019s doing and reaching out to see if she\u2019s free to catch up, but she rarely texts back.\n\nShe didn\u2019t pick up her bridesmaid dress from the boutique despite being asked to pick it up and I had to call them 3 months later and ask them to ship it to her house for her. I\u2019ve also had to constantly text her whether or not she wanted her makeup professionally done for the wedding; a simple yes or no question took weeks for her to answer me back, delaying the wedding planning process with my makeup artist.\n\nThe lack of communication on her end and my awareness of knowing she doesn\u2019t feel that we\u2019re there for her prompted me to text her and ask \u201cWhat is it as a friend that I can do for you? Do you need time to yourself? Do you want me to reach out and check on you more often? Do you want me to come by and just hang out at your place to chill like old times? I want to be there for you, but I can\u2019t if you don\u2019t tell me how you need me to.\u201d About another week has passed since then and I still haven\u2019t heard back from her.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve been bouncing back and forth between being frustrated with what feels like a one-way friendship, but I also feel for her and understand that she\u2019s probably still going through a really hard time still. I don\u2019t want to give up on this friendship because she\u2019s been present for a majority of my life, but at the same time, I don\u2019t want to put forth all this effort and not get anything back in return.\n\nAny advice on how to approach this situation moving forward?

I'm very selective with people since my time is limited, and I want a long-term intimate friendship, not a superficial trade of hi's and bye's like most people do. If you don't put effort in a friendship, don't expect me to do the same. I've met many people who are indifferent, and it sucks. I love people who are passionate about things like me, who are open minded and creative, and who like to discuss deep topics. It's even better if you share some of my interests, as that makes bonding easier. Now that I've specified what I'm looking for, I'll introduce myself!\n\n**Interests**\n\n* Vidyagames - I've played games my whole life, and I know every single one of them. RPGs, MMOs, Bullet Hells, FPS, Puzzle, Strategy, Platformers, Roguelikes, Metroidvanias, MOBAs, Sandboxes, Rhythm, Emulators; I've played every single genre. If you play something, chances are I have played it too. If you know what Touhou is, you'll be automatically cool.\n* Music - I have a *very* broad taste in music, and one of my dreams is to be a music composer one day. Classical, Jazz, Rock, Metal, and Videogame/Anime soundtracks are my favorite genres. If I were to talk about my favorite musicians this post would never end, but I'll mention the ones I listen to the most to give you an idea: Yoshihisa Hirano, Toby Fox, literally any classical composer, Danny Baranowsky, ZUN, and Yuki Kajiura. Music is my biggest passion, and I'd love to share my songs with someone. I also own a Violin and a Harmonica, although my favorite instrument is the Piano and I dream of playing it again (I'm too poor to afford one).\n* Anime - I don't watch anime as much as I used to given that Crunchyroll has such a small selection and other sites are illegal and risky, but I've watched a lot of anime in my life. My favorites are Death Note, Hunter x Hunter, Madoka Magica, Code Geass, Cowboy Bebop, Serial Experiments Lain, Steins;Gate, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Akame ga Kill, Monster and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni.\n* Literature - I've always been an avid reader, although lately I haven't read much due to stress. My favorite authors so far are H. P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe, William Shakespeare, George Orwell, and Ray Bradbury. \n* Computer Science - I got accepted into college for this major, so expect me to be devoted to it in the future. Right now since I have lots of free time I'm studying Java early to be ready for my first course, as my college is very competitive. I'd love to find someone who also plans to major in this or at least has interest in it, as it's quite hard and boring to study alone.\n* Philosophy - I tend to meditate a lot upon deep subjects that not many people care to think about. While I don't have time to seriously study it and my current knowledge is vague, I'm aware of the different schools of philosophy and the prominent philosophers. Like Socrates said, I know that I know nothing. I'm very open minded and love intellectual discussions with solid arguments.\n* Horror - It calms me, I don't know why. ~~I'm not a psychopath I promise.~~\n* Memes - They aren't as good as they used to be before the Fortnite/TikTok nation attacked, but I used to be a dedicated memer back in the days. If you know 4chan, Twitch, old YouTube, or NicoNico memes, you've gained my respect.\n* Food - I love all kinds of food and I'd love to be a chef one day.\n\n**Things about me**\n\n* I'm very pale, I weigh 114 pounds (being slim is great), I have green eyes and dark brown hair, and I'm assaulted by the obscure evil curse called acne.\n* I'm an INTP and Cancer.\n* My favorite weather is rain/snow and my favorite season is winter.\n* I might be an alien, shh.\n* I love cooking and my friends say my recipes look delicious.\n* I love all animals --they are much more pure and innocent than hoomans-- but mostly cats and spiders!\n* I was homeschooled by myself through high school, and I'm currently waiting to attend college in the fall.\n* I'm a Hikikomori.\n* I self-taught English as it's not my native language. \n* I have a 3.85 GPA and 29 ACT composite score, it's not the best but despite that I think I'm intelligent.\n* I love Dr Pepper.\n* I was bullied all my life, and I suffer from severe depression and social anxiety, so please bear with me.\n\nMy preferred platform is Discord, as I don't use anything else, so please be ready to talk there. And now, to close this post and make sure you read it, I'll ask a fun question! *If you were granted a single wish, what would you wish for? (Wishing for more wishes will not work here XD)*\n\nThank you a lot for reading this, have a nice day/night!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

{"post_id": "be4bth", "created_utc": 1555480596, "title": "Feeling isolated and lonely. How can I be more wise and make more friends?", "author": "cybercavalier", "self_text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a mature student a community college. While some of my schoolmates live on campus residence, I commute by driving to campus. I believe that the transportation is not the issue but I believe the less communication between me and my schoolmates is the issue. In my upper year, there are going to many chances to work as a team for laboratory or project work so making friends now in my lower or middle years is not only for personal identity but also for benefit of schoolwork, say to know what to study on final exam.\n\n1. I am an average to above average student but when I perform well in evaluation, I get grade A and A+. However, I am not an efficient learner so I have sacrificed my time in socializing with family and friends to attend the performance while numerous schoolmates don't. Among schoolmates who know me, I am either very hard working with schoolwork or obsessive with grades. The double edged sword of my faulty study habit is that I contemplate long for my learning. I learn and understand very well if I truly know a piece of knowledge but I truly struggle with something I cannot comprehend. My solution to the latter is deep thinking. So in essence I operate on the extreme ends of a spectrum, if you will.\n2. So I visited learning centre(s) frequently to make up my inefficiency. However, my questions to the tutors are often straightforward and a bit superficial because I have no idea where to start with my efficient learning. Slotting time for stick myself to the schedule by assignment calculator for essay often fails because of my family obligations. Most tutors whom I met shared blandly on how to study, such as, \"each person has its own learning style.\" Although the statement is correct, they did not share how to study efficiently. Technical details of tackling a particular assignment or report are more welcomed. However, there are few tutors --- 1 to 2 at most out of 10 plus I met ---   highlighting the practical wisdom of how to study. Tutors come and go each school year so meeting them are often random. I wanted to change this scenario so I have more time contributing to my life outside of the college and make more social connections.\n3. Few teachers and tutors pointed out that I think too much and too deeply on assignments. I often realize I do not fully comprehend the requirement of the assignment at the later time or last days of a big project. I am not particularly sportive but I realize I need to exercise as I get older. I find difficult to allot time to do so because of my faulty study habit.\n4. My past social and educational unpleasant experiences make me self aware of potential danger of compliance and relation with my schoolmate. In one occasion, another mature student when I had met him for the first few time realized that I am hard working (superficially). He later on wanted me to ask schoolmates so I think he would not appear unknowledgeable while I would. On the other hand, I do not have much to share on topic beyond academia so I am mostly a listener to non-academia topic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the moment, I felt I am caught in the middle of the web of deficiencies that I want to break out from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat can I do?

I loved the girl to death but it hurt to be with her about a month or so we broke up because she was texting a dude she was heavily flirting with when we weren\u2019t together. We were on and off but she talked to him again, I had blocked the kid so she unblocked him a week prior to us breaking up. So I leave the high school during when of my open periods(I\u2019m allowed to leave) and she flips shit on me and acts like she\u2019s done with me for a whole day so we don\u2019t talk to each other the rest of the day. The next day we got into a huge argument and then she said something about having a bunch of hoes then proceeded to show me a bunch of guys on Snapchat. Low and behold I saw the man I blocked on her Snapchat and freaked out. I got pissed and logged into her shit, it was a Wednesday when I found this out and it said they were taking and flirting since the last Thursday. Well I look at the messages to see they were talking extremely sexually that night and I broke up with her. A week went by and she had tried so many ways to talk to me since I had blocked her on everything. Slowly I got convinced to give her a chance and risk my mental health, which was the one of the main reasons I wouldn\u2019t go back. Then we get to the last week or so. She\u2019s acted weird, sheltered her phone constantly and never let me check her stuff. I had no trust in her at all and she only made it worse by not letting me see anything. So I forced her to give me her Snapchat password to get on her stuff and she acted dumb about it for 4 hours. When she let me get in she got rid of every persons messages I wanted to check and I flipped out. Well that night a dude who I use to be friends with (whom is a hoe) kept asking her to do shit knowing we were together. Well she shows me a screenshot of him messaging her and I see this kid in her messages again and I flipped shit. She changed the password again. I tried to see what was in their conversation. I have a panic attack and she admits everything I thought was right, but still wouldn\u2019t let me see what was said. The panic attack got worse and she gave me the password. We were on FaceTime while all this happened. I read about to about a week ago and see constant flirting. I told her upright I\u2019m done, I blocked her on everything and stared her down every time I\u2019ve seen her.\n\nTLDR:\nFreed myself from a toxic relationship which a girl who cheated on me multiple times, hid so much shit and lied to me constantly\n\nAbout me:\nI had friends the whole time we were together. I only had talked to her so I\u2019m lonely now. I\u2019m a huge nerd. I love Nintendo games, specifically smash bros(super hyped for joker tonight). I play a bunch on indie games as well(forager comes out tomorrow holy shit). If you want to talk DM me or Ask me to DM you. I\u2019m also an athlete, I run track and do hurtles. If you want to talk to me and get to know me more just DM me or something. I have no one anymore so I need friends.\n\nI live on the east cost of The US so I have EST time.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

{"post_id": "beda7l", "created_utc": 1555536489, "title": "Just tired of my job but where can I go?", "author": "TerrelAlucard", "self_text": "So from the title I just hate my job. I won't get too specific but it's retail and it's mostly spending most of the time in the back. I do a fair job, I always show up and mostly get my work down by the end of the day. I won't lie that I had days where I slacked off. I'm far from perfect but I feel guilt at the end of it when I don't do my best. I feel pretty old fashioned towards things even by internet standards which probably makes me the odd one of the bunch. I'm as much as a nerd and geek since I'm obsessed with gaming and personally it's the only thing I really do when I get home just to forget the day. I also love writing but can never commit to making an actual story. In a roleplay game, you'll see me make a lot of stories to whoever takes the time do so as well and really that's where I feel I'm at my element. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI say all of this because this next part is probably will turn most away in an instant. I'm African America, 30 and still living with my parents. Parents that both have medical problems that require me to watch over them from time to time. We have our good days and our bad but I know I'm on borrowed time. I dropped out of a community college because I just couldn't hold interest in my classes or one thing triggered me into a downward spiral I couldn't recover from or it was my addiction to gaming and procrastination that caused it.  Even one of my failures caused me to go for my first suicide attempt. It failed, with a friend I don't even know how to get into contact with today showing up before I could fully commit. I considered that day a miracle since I went a direction in the college most don't go and he just happened to see me and followed me all the way there. To this day I don't know if he knew I was about to try to jump or not but I went home that day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just trailed far too much in the past and well I feel it's necessary at the same time. I feel though a couple more pieces are needed to understand what I'm going through. I have bad anxiety issues, and when they happen I get clumsy like no tomorrow. The problem is I get anxiety due to crowds of people and since where I work is with crowds of people it can sometimes spike from time to time. Running into things, tripping, fumbling over words, the works. But I'm not telling the whole truth of how it spikes. Personally I think I'm intimidated by my own race or anyone bigger, stronger, or tougher looking then me. If you took one look at me though you probably think I'm a joke a bit too. A geeky 30 year old that least looks 25 year old wearing a plain long sleeve, jeans, and work boots even when not at work. I never found the appeal to flashy clothing or sneakers. I just choose what's comfortable to me and I'm just fine with that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently not everyone else is. Maybe it's paranoia but every time I walk by folks it always the awkward glances, three seconds passing and then laughter. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I tried to ignore it but when I had to move from the back to the front this usually happens. The awkward looks, them passing and then laughter. Maybe it's the way I'm walking. I always speed walk but that's because I just like to get to where I need to quickly. I may be walking a little feminine but I'm not sure whatever the case folks are laughing at it. I try to not let it get to me and my parents try to cheer me up and it works for a while. It never gotten too bad but lately with someone who was newer then me getting promoted and me staying the same it started to. The one that used to have the position was actually very good. He was questionable at times and a bit younger then me (23 I believe) but I could nerd out with him about games, anime, dungeons and dragons and memes. It was a great time and then he left for a better career.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I did not want the position he had. I did feel a twinge of jealousy when I wasn't even offered a chance towards it and it went to the other one. The one that often leaves for smoke breaks. It wasn't bad at first until I made little mistakes. Maybe I didn't open a box just right enough or mislead the label a few times (it's my third year working this job), and he tell me about it. I made note of it and moved on and then......my anxiety started kicking in slowly. Maybe I was nervous of making mistakes or well maybe since he was the boss of me now that I needed to do my best that it started, or maybe he was also my race but had none of the taste I had that made it an issue. Whatever the case, the laughter started maybe a month ago now. I can't even tell if he's laughing at something he's hearing on his phone or actually at me and my nervous glances every time he approaches. I trip up, drop something or fumble every time without fail. But soon after the laughter comes and it gotten so bad that he was avoiding glances at it but was on his knees laughing. I tried to get box on the line that day, failed and he laughed. I felt anger, rage, and hatred all at once. I wanted to tell him off but held my tongue by a razor wire. He laughed again, and I wanted to floor him that time and again I held back by just the razor wire. I switched my music over to gospel and calmed my down but I was shaking badly. I hated myself but knew I couldn't lose my job over this. Not again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I need to move on from retail but afraid to make a move. I know if I stay another day there though I'm going to do something I'm going to regret and I don't want it to get to that point. I'm considering education or at least training in a field but I'm afraid there's going to be a gap where I can't support my folks or even keep the internet running while I'm doing this. I know I need to grow up and be a man but it's hard. I feel emotions and feel I need to help everyone. I always try to be a gentleman as best as possible and really personally just only like the music of the 90's and back or purely anime pop. (Sorry but the music I hear today seems very lacking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI considered a career in computers even considered just being an author but have no clue where to even start with either of those. I love my parents but I know I need to move on but I'm unable to. I want to get past this anxiety this minor racism I have but I can't. It's difficult all of it. Maybe I'm overthinking it all but I just don't know anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never let myself get this vulnerable but I feel if something doesn't change today, things are only going to get worse. And I'm tired of things not getting better. So maybe this is why I'm reaching out for someone to hear my tale of woe. For just one person to listen and even if they don't comment at it at least give an understanding. And if they consider me garbage and a terrible person, that's fine too. All in all I don't know why I'm posting all of this at all. I just know I can't take another day of this job. The laughter, the feeling of not belonging, for another day. That's about all I have to get off my chest. And personally I thank you for taking the time to read it all the way to the end, and if you're a major pc player, roleplayer, or just like anime, feel free to talk. But once again, thank you. You could have read or been anything else but you choose it to read about a guy in a 1/3 of his life crisis. Thank you and bless you.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

C and I have been friends for a couple years and she\u2019s honestly really sweet buuuuut She\u2019s always been a bit \u201coff\u201d like decision making wise and has told me she\u2019s developmentally delayed (honestly not sure what that really means but she acts kind of like a very early teenager) Here\u2019s where this causes problems. My favorite game is cards against humanity and every now and then I\u2019ll invite a bunch of people over for a big game. C also likes cards against humanity so I normally invite her along. Here\u2019s the problem, she can be VERY hard to deal with (I\u2019m used to it and don\u2019t get bothered by her easily) and doesn\u2019t understand when she should stop talking. last time I threw a CAH party I had about 7 people over and we were having a great time until C asked my friend A a question regarding his ex girlfriend. Now A and his girlfriend had broken up shortly before this and he was a heart broken mess. C did not know this and after he told her she just kept pressing and asking questions even after I told her to shut the fuck up. eventually we paused the game and I went outside with my friend J because she wanted company while she smoked a cigarette. as J and I were heading inside I see A storming out visibly upset. He tells me he\u2019s leaving and says goodnight. I go back inside and we finish the game but there\u2019s a tension. Eventually everyone goes home and I take C home and ask her what happened and she gave me viable answers so I dropped it. the next day my best friend S who had also been at the party told me C had kept pressing A about the ex girlfriend and wouldn\u2019t stop asking him questions until he finally snapped. now because she caused this problem my other friends do not want to come to another CAH party if she comes because they don\u2019t want a repeat. C has been asking me when I\u2019m hosting another party and I just told her I didn\u2019t know. my question is, how do I approach this issue? I really don\u2019t want to sneak a party behind her back but at the same time I don\u2019t want her at another party after what she pulled last time especially if certain people won\u2019t come because of her. Do I tell her why she\u2019s not allowed at any of my other parties? I feel tremendously bad for her since she doesn\u2019t really have any true friends besides me. she doesn\u2019t understand the difference between friends and acquaintances and referred to all of the girls at my party her \u201cbesties\u201d when in fact she hardly knows them. I\u2019m perplexed because I do enjoy her company and don\u2019t want to hurt her feeling but I also don\u2019t want my other friends to be turned off of attending a party if C will be there. \n\nOh and for anyone who is wondering my friends and I are all between the ages of 19-22.

{"post_id": "benezk", "created_utc": 1555604020, "title": "Needy friend just won't let go", "author": "lesliebogart", "self_text": "A common friend introduced us and after just a few weeks we started to hang out regularly and text and call each other pretty much everyday. This is a common pattern that I've had with more people: it's kind of an infatuation at first and then it dies out into a regular friendship. I did notice that we were spending a lot of time together, but I was comfortable and also had a lot of free time at the time (was going through a rough patch and didn't really have any job/studies to occupy my time) so I'd hardly ever decline any offer to hang out from practically anyone. After a couple of months, the relationship began to wear me down. It became more and more obvious that we never really had that much in common and that she seemed to need me much more than I needed her. I began to try and put some distance between us as by spacing out texts, phonecalls and hangouts, but she never seemed to get it and would just keep calling and texting until I responded. I even had a bad depressive episode (unrelated to her, but the situation didn't help) and explicitly asked her for some time alone but not even that helped: she simply reduced her phonecalls/texts from three to one per day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's very open about having trust issues and a huge fear of abandonment and this is a pattern that I've observed in a lot of her other relationships. There are people she hasn't seen in months and that don't really pay that much attention to her and she will still text them every two or three days just to sort of \"keep them there\". All of this makes it even harder for me to be honest with her or confront her, because she will get angry or cry easily. Also she has told me that I'm the first \"real friend\" she has ever had, which doesn't help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll this tension exploded a month (or so) ago. She made some choices regarding her ex that I didn't agree with and, although I kept it for myself, it was obvious and she noticed. She flipped the fuck out. For three days straight, she had numerous arguments with me and other friends that shared my opinion of her ex and was extremely rude. I hate aggresive people, I have an abusive family and any sort of yelling or disrespect causes me great distress. This is something that she knows and that I have been open about for as long as we've been friends. I can take one angry day, we're all human, but she's always had this angry tendency and I had taken a lot of crap from her and had been patient with her mood swings for a long time and this was the last straw for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided to have a serious conversation to settle things and she continued to have the same attitude: she came as far as to mock me and state that she was proud of her mood swings because she was \"authenthic\" and heavily implied that I was not (she also knows I have issues opening out, which makes it harder for me to forgive her). Eventually, she calmed down and, although she didn't apologize, she seemed to understand a bit what was going on and we agreed that we couldn't go on seeing each other as often as we once did. I suggested keeping it down to one time per week and it ended there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said it as an example, I didn't *actually* mean \"let's talk only once a week\", but this is exactly what she seemed to understand. Ever since that conversation, I've only hung out with her twice and always with another friend, because I just can't take her alone. Once a week, on the clock, she will text me and ask me how I'm doing and suggest hanging out and I just can't take it. I haven't really forgiven her for what she did (nor has she properly apologized) and I don't really miss talking/hanging out with her. I make excuses and \"forget\" to text back (which is something I don't do and she knows this) but she doesn't seem to take the hint.

I'm gonna say I've known her for about 8 years now. We're both adults in our 20's and living our lives.  \nBut, I have been making realizations about this friend, and noticing that she's becoming the \"toxic person\" that she's always complained about.  \nWhenever we meet up, it's one-sided anymore. She'll talk about herself, her problems, and that's that. I rarely have the opportunity to get a word in, unless it's about her, and whatever questionable behaviour she's been engaging in lately that she needs advice on (but rarely ever takes said advice).  \nI'm a bit put off to have a serious conversation with her, about us, since she and my boyfriend (they've known each other maybe a year or two longer than she's known me) ended up having a less than pleasant talk which ended up in my friend drunkenly shouting. I don't know the full situation on their part, but I now know enough from both sides, with having run into her the other night.   \nI don't know if I should have a heartfelt, one-on-one talk with her or not. I don't know if she would listen, if she's too far deep to even listen. I want to, but I don't know if it would do any good. Maybe I should just leave a ticking time bomb be?\n\n  \nTLDR: Long-term friend is being a crappy friend/person, I feel awkward talking to her about it because my boyfriend already has and it turned out bad, and I feel it wouldn't be right to just drop her because she introduced me to my boyfriend. Just at a loss of what to do, if anything at all.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I am happiest when I'm exploring and taking in the sights of a brand new country or city I've never been before, and then chowing down on the local cuisine.

{"post_id": "beqrtt", "created_utc": 1555621745, "title": "Friend is just so negative and draining", "author": "tequilastars", "self_text": "OK, so backstory: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met this girl when I was 18, and we hit it off right away. We've been good friends for about 4 years, and I love her dearly. She's fun to be around, we both love anime and a lot of the same shows, and we go out to clubs a lot. We basically just have a lot in common. But, the issue is she's one of the most negative, always-turns-the-conversation-around-on-herself type of person I've ever met, and every time I walk away from having a conversation with her it's just so draining and not fun. I've started to dread hanging out with her. \n\nI'm not quite sure when this change happens, but I definitely started to notice it last year. She's had a rough year, let's just be clear. Her and her boyfriend, who was transphobic and sexist to boot, broke up, which was pretty upsetting for her. It was also partly my fault as me and him didn't get along very well. She doesn't have a great relationship with her family. I've never met her parents, that's how bad it is. She had to leave home when she was sixteen. \n\nTo be fair, we kind of didn't hang out as much when she had a boyfriend, but I noticed every time we did talk, it was always about how bad her life was and how she wanted to turn it around. If it wasn't the doctors, she and her boyfriend were fighting all the time. If it wasn't her boyfriend, her parents were being assholes. If it wasn't her parents, her other friends were being unsupportive. If it wasn't her friends, it was some medical issue that meant she couldn't do anything anymore. She just was always pointing out how bad her life was. It's only gotten worse since she and that boyfriend broke up. \n\nWhen they broke up, I did feel bad. He was a jerk, but she did like him a lot, and they were together for a year and a half. Again, it was kind of my fault. Long story short, I basically stated an opinion (in a conversation that had nothing to do with him), and he jumped on it and basically told me I was an idiot. This opened a whole can of worms, and before I knew it, they were screaming at each other. Then, two weeks later they were done. This happened about 6 months ago. \n\nHowever, since then, she's lost her job, has to live with her cousins on a couch, and spends all of her time moaning about how depressed and anxious she is all the time and complaining over the fact that her life sucks and nobody supports her. I've really tried to be supportive, but it's been 6 months and I'm starting to be impatient. \n\nNot only that, but it's just so draining to be around her, as it feels like she's not even helping herself a little bit. Yes, she got fired, but she's doing the bare minimum looking for a job. She has a goal of being a coast guard and complains all the time about how it's too hard to do it. She tried living with her grandparents for a few months, who are very nice and also very supportive, I've met them more than once, but complained the entire time while she was there that all they were doing was trying to get her to go to an employment agency. \n\nAgain, I love her. But more and more lately, I don't want to hang out with her or talk to her. Every time she complains about something new, I want to shake her and yell \"THAT'S LIFE! JUST DEAL WITH IT!\" I feel like I'm being a horrible friend. Not only that, but she just makes everything about herself. I'm at school right now, and I'm working hard, and I've definitely had some days where I just want to cry and vent. I can't go to her because I know that less than 20 minutes into it, she'll find a way to bring up herself. It'd be fine if this happened every once in a while, but it's happened every single time I have a problem and I go to her. Not only that, but once I'm done venting, I actually go out and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. \n\nAgain, I love her. She's a fun person to be around. We send memes back and forth and binge Attack on Titan together. She's just constantly accepting the bottom of the barrel. She has all of these goals, does nothing to accomplish them, and then complains all about how everyone is against her and nobody is supporting her, when most of her problems are very fixable. She just refuses to DO ANYTHING ABOUT THEM. I'm really trying to be supportive, but it's just really hard when all she does is complain. \n\nI have my own mental health issues. I need someone to talk to sometimes. But I'm also doing things to combat them and do my thing. Every time I walk away from spending time with her I feel like shit. Seriously. It's just so exhausting hanging out with her. I don't want to end the friendship, but I'm also not sure how to approach a conversation about this without coming off as a total bitch. Either way, I'm going to be the bad guy. \n\nTo sum it up; my friend complains a lot. It's all about her. I'm afraid I'm going to have to end the friendship, not because I don't love her. She's just constantly exhausting to be around. I don't know what to say to her or what to do. Help.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Thank you!* :) \n\n\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info (AKA full autobiography) about me:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate. In the process of joining CAF\u2019s reserves as, planning on Military Police role. \n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned careers, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics. At least, in regards to most topics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, although it had not surfaced for quite a while now; enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n- Chronically single, not that it is pertinent (After all, this is not r/r4r, ~~unless it is~~ - but *no* - I do not want your wiener and / or boob pictures, unless it is a wiener dog or you've a pair cuter than [these ones](https://galapagosconservation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Wildlife-BFB_1000x600.jpg)).\n\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am rather stigmatized against the latter by some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not, in fact, a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandise and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed.\nDespite that, I am in favor of marijuana's legalization so who knows \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\n- Gainfully *un*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work. Also trying to get a job as a security guard.\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Automata, WoW, Bioshock series, Prey, Metal Gear Solid, the &gt;Observer_, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. \nHonestly, for whatever reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nRight now I am playing the Cultist SImulator, a rather obscure and confusing game by the developer of one of my favourite games. 10/10 would summon a burning demon to kill cops again.. unless the fucking thing rebels and tries to kill me. \nAlso SOMA, which I am loving the hell out of. I also fucking hate it, because I don't like being scared ;~; But seriously, that game hits all the right buttons for me. \n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favourite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \nAlso just re-started Futurama after finishing season 7. Woo.\n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favourite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loathe cheap jumpscares they are so enamoured with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n\n- My sense of humour is possibly the worst, and I take pride in having offensive memes for every occasion ready. Needless to say, I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile stuff. \n\n- My main hobby right now is Airsoft. I spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together since I ordered most of my gear from companies in Russia, not wanting to settle for cheaper subsitutes. At least the quality is as good as it gets!  \nThe centrepiece of my collection is my plate carrier which came with full kevlar inserts and is of the model that is only issued to specific units of Russia's FSB. \n\nHad a game this weekend, and it was a riot. I dropped my pistol in the mud, my red dot died right before the game and I was reduced to using iron sights (I hate iron sights), but it was fantastic. \n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I suck at categorizing music that I like, and listen to most genres, so it is simpler to say what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord).\nSeriously though, I am big on modern and older metal, rock, punk, indie-esque stuff, EDM and so on. \n\n I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n\nSome of my favourite bands are Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Muse, Green Day, Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, NIN and many, many more - if it is not obvious by this point, I am so edgy that I (used to) cut myself :D\n\n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%, due to a certain affinity for slithering neck-ties and positive human qualities like ambition, narcissism and general douchebaggery. But hey, at least I am honest (?) :D \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. Stuf like lack o punctuatuion impropar gramar to short n generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit. \n\nAgain, rephrasing the last part for dozens of people who simply don't get it: *you now know a certain amount about myself. After reading your message, I should be able to know a certain amount about you - not asking for something as in depth as here, but the \"Hello my name is X I am from Y and I like Z\" is not good enough.*\n\nAlso, here are some pictures of [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0), because why not? \n\n *Please, PMs only*! I loath Reddit Chat UI. I would prefer to talk here for the first while as compared to going over to certain apps whose names trigger bots..\nThe odds are, if you ignore this, I will either not see your Chat or don\u2019t reply on principle :3 \n... If you did not understand it, I am on the picky side.\n\nFeel free to hit me with your favourite ice breaker / shower question!

Anyway, here it is. One of my most amazing friends just auditioned for a talent show that I judged as part of the school's club for the show. He danced to Lady Gaga and I was so happy to see him so expressive. I had no problem giving my criticism on the side as we are basically best friends, and he gladly accepted it. Here is the problem. \n\nThe school club said something along the lines of \"he's tried out twice before already, he has to get in this year\". I understood that as \"We feel bad for him, he's tried out twice already, it's his third, just let him in.\" I saw it as pitiful and destructive to my friend's dignity. I said absolutely nothing while the school club discussed this. Also, my friend is openly gay. They said something about diversity as well, which is I agree with, but I feel as though they didn't truly accept him based on what he came to show them; his talent. They focused on everything else. Also, a teacher said he would talk to him about outfit choices \"just in case\", which rubbed me the wrong way but that's just a stretch.\n\n I don't know if I should tell him what they said, he doesn't know he has been accepted yet, and I almost accidentally dropped the bomb while talking to him today. I feel like it would drop his confidence, but at the same time, he deserves to know the truth. What do I do? Do I tell him after the results come out, before, or not at all?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

All in due time. \n\nI know that politics is a strong taboo, but not really to me. It\u2019s a big part of who I am, so why should I hide it? I\u2019m politically very far to the left. In the German conception I should probably be Die Linke, but I have way too many complaints about that party, so I wind up pragmatically supporting the SPD, the social democrats. \n\nI\u2019m not going to dump my whole backstory here, but to be brief, my father is American, and my mother is german. The German side of my family comes from the former East, and so that paints a lot of how I see things! \n\nOn to more light hearted topics, I have serious interests in being a writer. I don\u2019t want to pursue it as a profession, but publishing literature is a dream come mind!

I seen a friend there and realized how drunk I was when I was trying to say hi. That\u2019s really all I remember , but I had a few friends say I was passed out with my head down at the table. My friend and her man walked me out to the truck. When they were driving apparently he tried reaching in the back seat and touching my leg. I don\u2019t remember much because I would wake up for a sec and pass back out. But she told me this happened. I guess he drove us to her house And they left me in the truck. They went inside to have sex and he told her he wanted a threesome she told him no and he left in the truck and took me with him. I was passed out this whole time and didn\u2019t even notice that we had went there to her house. When we left she was calling both of our phones. I didn\u2019t answer because i was still passed out. He didn\u2019t answer either and he was sober. I left her house at 3:15 and not sure when I got home but apparently it was around 4. She came to look for me but I wasn\u2019t home. I remember waking up and seeing we were on a street and then dozing back off, and we were in front of my house I was laying down in the back seat and I woke up not sure if he woke me up but he was standing by the truck door. I walked inside my house to my bed, and then around 4:30 I heard my phone vibrating and I woke up feeling sick. I seen a lot of missed calls and called my friend back and I can\u2019t really remember what I said. And then hung up and went back to sleep. The next day she was looking at me weird. I didn\u2019t think much because I was still feeling drunk the next morning when we went to eat. I didn\u2019t think much of it because I assumed nothing happened and then I started realizing the situation. Her man took me home and she left me alone w him. I was upset that she would do that. But I tried to ignore it. A few days later she said that he told her he had sex with me. And she told all my friends what he said. But made it seem like I wanted to have sex with him. I remember checking myself the next morning, I felt fine my clothes were on and everything but I did have bruises on my legs. I told her nothing happened because I don\u2019t remember anything happening. But he told her himself we had sex. Everyone that seen me that night knows how drunk i was but now she has told our mutual friend I had sex with him. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m hurt. I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s true if he did something to me. He constantly lies to her, about other things, she tells me about their relationship.  But I just don\u2019t know why he would lie about this. What should I do. She still tries to act like my friend, but I\u2019m just so torn as to why she would still talk to him.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

{"post_id": "bewcj5", "created_utc": 1555658199, "title": "Self doubt, worry, frustration and a not quite friend next door.", "author": "ninesisters", "self_text": "So my story is this. I'm 41 years old, and I never had many friends. The few I had moved away, and I miss people to hang out with. I've always been socially uncomfortable and awkward, and my persona has kind of developed around being a loner. I'm also occasionally battling bouts of depression. I recently had a lot of time to think about my life and needs, and decided that this isn't good for me. So I started trying to reach out to people and build some acquaintances, perhaps new friends. This is super hard for me to do.\n\nWhich brings me to a neighbor who lives next door. We used to go to the same school, but never knew each other. I like her company, and I think she enjoys mine. But she's dealing with a lot of issues of her own, including some depression she went trough last year. At the time I managed to say hello and invite her to dinner, she was pretty down, withdrawn. But I think it helped her a bit out of the hole, and we continued to hang out every now and then, and it was pretty nice to just have somebody to talk to, watch a movie with, etc. She would send me a text or knock on my door, or I would, things where going well. It felt like I had found somebody that could someday maybe a friend.\n\nNow the thing is, I thought I wasn't very lonely, or I didn't need much company. But this acquaintance made me realize, I'm fucking lonely, and I desperately want some company. I'm kinda tearing up as I write this.\n\nBut then things changed. She got out of her hole and resumed her social life. And boy does she have a social life. And like that hanging out together got less frequent, there would be no texts, or knocks on the door anymore. For a while there was a regular dinner with another neighbor that we did together, but that seems to be falling apart too.\n\nSo the last two times she was hanging out (which was pleasant otherwise) she was indicating she did it because she felt bad for me. Not as directly as that, but it was there. I didn't react to it then, but this hurt me on so many levels.\n\nI do understand she's dealing with a lot of her own issues, and that she's got plenty of social life to go around when she's not battling her own depression, and that somebody who you just knew a couple months may just not cut it (perhaps yet, if ever) for a closer friend circle (especially if you've got like a gazillion friends). I don't take any of that personally (or at least I try not to, and intellectually this goes pretty well).\n\nBut I do have so many feelings about what's going on like:\n\n- Did I do something wrong? (silly I know)\n- Did I expect too much out of that?\n- Was I just a means to claw herself out of depression and she got what she needed out of the acquaintance? I'm genuinely happy if that worked for her, but it would leave me feeling kinda used.\n- Am I burden now, and are invites to hang out making her feel guilty? I don't want that...\n- What am I supposed to do now? This was as close to finding a friend as I got in years, perhaps a decade. Forever alone? Fuuuu...\n- Will it seem too clingy when I occasionally invite her to an activity?\n- Did I do the typical thing socially desperate people do and try to hang on to an acquaintance like I'm about to drown?\n\nYou get the picture. So my problem, I think, isn't so much how this friendship goes, but more myself, how to deal with all the pent up issues that kind of come pouring out of me. This shit all makes me tense and confused, and leaves me kinda frustrated and sad. I'm well otherwise, but this adventure in socializing has me kinda drained.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Im walking around having a great time when I hear him just making comment after comment about me. Its not just paranoia believe me I have it confirmed w the other 2 friends. It legit drove me so depressed during my trip that I legit thought I might need therapy. I realized how sick I am being around him and shit and would have stopped talking to him a long time ago if it werent for him living with one of the other friends next year. This other guy is one of the coolest people ive ever met and dont really want to lose as a friend bc of brian. I would honestly tell brian to go fuck himself but I feel like the tension would be too high and awkward everytime I went to their house next year to hand out with the other friend.

I have nothing against harmless banter but it's annoying when its done 24/7 .As years went by I moved to England to study and we didn't speak much. One summer I caught up with him and he told me you've changed and it's not good. We've fought several times and patched up together.

One of these friends I didn't get along with as much as the others, let's call him Paul. The other two friends, John and Ringo I've known the longest and they consider me family. \n\nPaul and I are the type to spend long hours playing games together online - the kind of games our other friends don't like as much - and so over the years there have been plenty of moments where we got frustrated at each other.\n\nAs a disclaimer, in my younger years I was a bit of a douche and my humor was usually at others expense. Some people didn't mind that humor, but Paul silently hated it.\n\nthe group plays D&amp;D and over theast year I bowed out of the group because the year before Paul had essentially ruined the game for me and showing up for 4 hours of torture every week got to me. After that year without me, the group wanted to start the next campaign with me again...\n\nThough we hadn't hung out or even talked in a year, one day recently Paul reached out to John and Ringo and let out a lot of steam that had built up over the years, about me. He had a long list of complaints, most of which I'll never know as Paul isn't the confrontational type, and refuses to talk to me anymore. According to John and Ringo he said some pretty harsh things including that I \"didn't deserve to live\". \n\nThat last line upset them and has upset me too over the last few months. \n\nI should point out that atno point in our lives have I done some single misdeed worth wishing death on me for. In fact, I've always considered my friendship with Paul to be strong even though we get on each other's nerves now and then. The only time physical violence was ever threatened was by him, and that happened almost 10 years ago. \n\nSo John and Ringo pushed me to reach out to Paul and try to bridge that gap with him. I tried reaching out to him a few times and even laid out that I want to listen to him and hear everything he has to say. He has cold shouldered me, and we still have not spoken (3 months now). John and Ringo continue to be friends with him, and even play in a sideD&amp;D game with him during the week.\n\nNow that the set up is done, here's my issue:\n\nIt hurts to hear them talk about Paul and what they do with Paul still etc. On one hand I don't expect them to drop a friend just because they don't like me, but on the other hand, if someone wished DEATH upon John, Ringo, or anyone else that I consider family, I wouldn't be able to continue being their friend...\n\nAm I wrong to feel betrayed by John and Ringo? If so, what can I do to help myself not hurt so much?\nWhat advice would you give for Paul and is there any way to salvage the friendship or approach from another angle?\n\nPaul is far out of state so no way to show up at his door in the rain with flowers :(\n\nAny advice in general would be great.\n\nEdit: part of my frustrations (which becomes anger as I brew over it) is that he is going around to my closest friends that we share and telling THEM what he hates about me, and tries to get them on his side. But he won't tell ME what the issues are and it feels like bullying. Maybe that's not a good word, but I'm being attacked by something I can't see, and he won't let me make it better.

My best friend who was also my roommate at the time had a girlfriend and he would always talk shit on her, and just not treat her right. They eventually broke up and he didn't seem to phased by it. Her and I would talk though about their relationship and how he is and stuff, we hung out a couple of times and then one thing led to another, sadly they literally broke up a couple of days when this happened, we made out and, idk if you'd call it sex, but I got in and just stopped because I knew what I was doing was wrong. I can't justify it for not being sex because I knew what happening, I hate myself for what I did to my best friend. \n\nThe next day I confessed to him what I had done, he didn't seem mad or upset just disappointed in me, I'm also so so so stupid I gained feelings for her. I think it was mostly lust at the time. We still lived with each other for awhile and I thought we were friends still but it was never the same. \nHe eventually moved out with another group of friends, and I always asked if it was cause of what I did, but I always knew it was what I did. Once he moved out he stopped talking to me and stopped inviting me to do things, we all used to be a pretty tight group, we would all do things together, play games, hang out. I was pretty much exiled and went into a depression. I knew that I deserved it though. \n\nWere still friends today and I thought things had gotten better (it's been 6 years) but honestly I feel like I'm still paying for it, I try and think we can still be friends but I think that's never gonna happen. He supposed to be a groomsman in my wedding but he still hardly talks to me or tries to. I try and play online games with him to keep the friendship going but he chooses still to play with the other friends.\n\nSorry for the long post, just wondering if anyone else has done anything shitty and been left alone with no one to talk to.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I am a girl and I have many guy friends. This one guy friend of mine was one of my roommates for a couple of years and we were like family, we are really good friends. There has never been anything between us besides friendship.  \n\n\n A couple of years ago, he got a girlfriend. As their relationship has developed I have noticed some moments when his girlfriend seems to have felt uncomfortable/jealous or threatened by me and our friendship. It makes things awkward because I almost feel a wall being formed between this guy friend and I. I feel the need to be more reserved and less open with him, and likewise I feel like he might feel the same. I don't have anything against her, but sometimes I just want to hang out with my friend!   \n\n\n He and I have a pretty big mutual interest which is video games (she doesn't seem to share the same interest). Much of what we used to do when we were room mates was just sit around and play games.  Last time I was at his house and we started playing video games, she was sitting on the couch on her laptop, it felt like he felt rushed, like we had to hurry up and move on to an activity that we could all do together. Which is fine, but sometimes I really would just like to hang out with my friend and do what we like to do together without feeling like we have to do something else to cater to her too if she isn't interested in what we are doing. \n\nI can understand if she feels uncomfortable. I probably would too. It's hard not to feel jealous of a boyfriend's friends, especially if they are the opposite sex. I love her because he loves her and I do what I can to be a friend to her along with him, but she and I don't really have anything in common and she's not really someone I would be friends with in an outside situation. I think I am unintentionally dismissive of her sometimes because of it and that frustrates me. I really don't want her to feel like I don't like her or that I don't want to be around her or for her to be around. (even though I do feel that way sometimes)  \n\n\n Sometimes it's hard because I feel kind of pushed off to the side as a friend or like our friendship has to be interrupted or diluted just because I am a girl and he has a girlfriend.  I don't even dare to find out if he can hang out during the week because I'm worried about making things weird for him, like he could get in trouble, if she isn't there. \n\nSo I feel like I can't hang out with him alone, but we can't just do what we do when she's around, and she has shown signs of feeling threatened by my presence. I realize that this may just be a part of life. We are adults, and sometimes things like this just happen. I realize that this relationship is important to him. I want to be respectful of their relationship and I also realize that a lot of this is up to them as individuals and as a couple, but is there anything I can do? How can I get around these things? Is there a way for that to even happen? How can I help her to feel comfortable and like she doesn't have be concerned that he and I might something weird going on?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

This would normally not be a problem but 1. he is married and 2. his sister our old friend had a really bad falling out with J. \n\nNow because they are both my friends I want them to be happy especially J, I was in love with her in high school but I never told her back then because i didn't know  she was bi back then. I also may have had a very tiny cruch on D too in high school, but he was my friends brother so not is a big no no. \n\nAnyway now I'm in a loving monogamous relationship with my boyfriend who I have been with for almost 4 years and we love each other and live together. And I'm starting to have those old feelings for J and I have to stop because she has enough on her plate with a married friend being in love with her. D says he has been miserable with his wife who doesn't listen to him or understand who he really is, and that J does, that they are best friend. But J and I  don't want him to lose everything because of her, even if it means he will be happy. \n\nI guess I'm conflicted in a lot of ways, I tell him to just talk to his wife about his unhappiness and end it, or work on his marriage  before him and J do anything stupid.

I've tried meeting people from these friend making subreddits, mainly just this one, and I guess I'm just a little disappointed that none of them have ever really gone anywhere. It's kind of difficult to pinpoint a reason why, maybe the other person didn't engage enough and I sort of lost interest, or maybe I'm not as interesting to them as they had hoped. Idk. If you happen to be one of the people that this happened with, I just want to say that it's nothing personal. I'm just kind of an awkward dude and have trouble being the first to open up I suppose. Especially if I don't feel that it's coming back with the same level of enthusiasm that I attempt to put into these things.\n\nBut these experiences here have kind of given some teeth to the suspicion I've always had that perhaps meaningful friendships can't really be achieved through text. At least not for everyone. I don't know, I'm sure there are plenty of you that could chime in and share a story or two about a time when it did work for you. But I'm willing to bet that if you have formed long term friendships that way, you wouldn't be here looking for more friends. Maybe I'm just kind of cynical.\n\nThis is one of those things where I would very much like to be proven wrong. If I meet someone cool af because of this dumb rant, then that'll be fucking awesome. But somehow I don't think that will happen. As an introverted dude in his 30s, I was always kind of hoping for the internet to be a viable method to meet people so I wouldn't have to go out of my comfort zone and try to look for meetups, game nights, special events at bars or other shit like that. But maybe that's what it will take for me, idk. I know pen pals have been a thing for a very long time and people have maintained very close friendships that way, even through snail mail. But things like this sub and online dating and shit like that, they feel different somehow.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading this, those of you that did.

I also like watching Tik Tok cringe compilations just to make myself suffer. \n\nI just need a kind person, hopefully with the same sense of humor, to spend time with and have fun with. Message me the word teriyakititties if you\u2019ve read this whole post. I\u2019d totally be down to play some simple games together (my WiFi is too shitty to play any online games such as Overwatch/Apex Legends and it\u2019s so tragic), so things like Town of Salem, Legends, Cards against Humanity, and any other online game that doesn\u2019t require fast internet are all on the table! \n\nPlease be between the ages of 17-21. Don\u2019t care about anything else, just be nice. :)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

He comes to my house for a night out with no alcohol knowing that I will give him some because it\u2019s what I do he\u2019s my friend. I tell him a time and he comes an hour later on purpose to piss me off. He would rather stay at my house until later for no reason even though my parents want to go to bed. Then he wants to walk 10 minutes to a cash machine then get the taxi from there, when If we got the taxi into town first (me paying because he has no money) then they can drop us off at a cash machine. Then he doesn\u2019t understand when I am telling him all this it\u2019s like he thinks it\u2019s normal. I\u2019ve been really hurt recently over a breakup and he\u2019s not even helping me through it, again he just doesn\u2019t think, it\u2019s the way he has become. It\u2019s like he can\u2019t see my pain. \n\nThen now, he knew that I might of liked this girl and I told him I did, I\u2019ve been talking to her for a while now. She got his number last night when we were clubbing off her mate that he ghosted. He just stayed at the back of the club while I talked to her. Ok I\u2019m not that bothered about her but it\u2019s sort of the principle that friends don\u2019t do that. You don\u2019t start talking to somebody your friend likes it\u2019s a rule, if he liked somebody I would go after somebody else. But it\u2019s like I said I seriously don\u2019t think he actually thinks he is doing anything wrong, he thinks all this is normal, yet he is acting like a complete dickhead. He doesn\u2019t think he is doing anything wrong or that like walking all that way to a cash machine is normal. If I talk to him about it he will be so calm again wondering what the problem is.\n\nI\u2019m beginning to think it\u2019s me who\u2019s been a dickhead, am I? He can have the girl if he wants but again I\u2019m a bit hurt by him not at least asking me first. Just carrying on like everything is perfectly normal.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I work and go to school full-time. I have to study sometimes.\n\n**What I am looking for in a friend:**\n\n* Please be between ages 25-32. \n* M or F is fine, but I'm expecting 95% of replies to be male, so male it is!\n* I'm looking for people who prefer text chat.

Sometimes I get a hundred replies, only to find no one who wants the same sort of friendship that I want. \n\nIt can be unfortunate investing a lot of time and effort into building a friendship, only to find out each person wants something completely different out of the relationship or you are incompatible for the most basic of reasons...

Would be great to chat about it", "author": "PlaneSuggestion", "self_text": "Hello there :)\n\nThis is a bit of a weird situation. After about 4 months, I felt it was okay to reach out to my former partner. We dated for 6 years, which is a pretty long time, so needed more than a few weeks before I felt ready to.\n\nWe broke up on amicable terms, her wanting to find herself and her own interests and path in life etc.\n\nSo yesterday I reached out, wanting to see where she's at. Not to 'get back together' or out of desperation. But rather just to see what she's up to, tell her what I'm up to, and see how we both feel now. Of course there's an option for us to want more, and I'd be open to explore that, but also possible for us to just be friends or even less than that.\n\nSo we've sent a few messages back and forth, and it's been nice catching up and seeing where she's at. But her last few responses were somewhat short and not really asking much questions back. So I'm getting the vibe that she's not ready to talk yet either, but I have no idea what to do now: just stop talking without responding and essentially ghost her? Try to keep talking and see how she responds? Be open and honest and ask her what she wants?\n\nSo enough about that situation. A little more about me:\n\nI work with kids every day, I fricken' love it. They're the best; also the worst, but the scale balances in their favor. I've found that I make a lot of dad-jokes with them, without being a dad. So I suppose it's surrogate humor.\n\nI've picked up running for the past three months. So on most evenings (around 11:30 PM), you'll find my room vacated: A crumpled copy of The Time Traveler's Wife perched on my desk that has my chestnut guitar leaning against it and a bowl of pistachios I bought 3 weeks ago waiting to be consumed. I listen to videogame soundtracks while running, it's great. Particularly Mario :D\n\nI'm an avid fan of music. I just moved into a new place with a flatmate who enthusiastically gets into jam sessions with me :) I started on piano when I was 8, but picked up guitar at 14. I'm immersing myself in older artists right now, mainly Fleetwood Mac, Eric Clapton and Neil Young. I'm a big fan of acoustic stuff, but love all music! :D Sort of.\n\nMovies, I love deep thought provoking Sci-Fi movies, terrifying Horror, oscar-bait films on occasion, and most Marvel movies. Period-Drama is the only genre I consistently cannot get into. Bleugh.\n\nSo message me if any of this sounds interesting; give me a lil insight into your opinion on period dramas!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I sent a second text (26 Hours later) joking that it was a stupid question by me. The text was not rude. The friend never replied. I grew concerned. And, was convinced I was being ghosted. The following morning, Saturday, I asked \u201cCan you say something? This is not like you. Are you alright? Please do not play games \u2639\u201d To my horror, the friend replied with \u201cI am not playing games my grandma died the day you texted. I do not have time for this right now.\u201d I immediately apologized for my disgusting behavior. I also told her if she needed anything to contact me.\n\nI feel guilty. Awful. I am also worried I lost my friend. She hates when I demand attention. I know I made assumptions. I know I should have left her alone. My insecurity has been a recurring issue in the friendship. When I am ignored, I push for a response. This insecurity arose last year when she ghosted me. She recognized that was awful and reciprocated. Yet, the damage was done. So, this week I assumed she was ghosting again.\n\nRight now, she needs space. Yet, what should I say or do? In two weeks, I\u2019m thinking of sending her an apology/how are you going with the death text. I worry texting her soon will only aggravate her. I am conscious that she is going through a lot. My needs are secondary. Her needs should be first. I would still like advice as I feel guilty. Did I destroy the friendship? I feel reaching out is a bad idea.\n\nI\u2019m new to reddit.

I recently got broken up with (rough, but for the best - it was about to turn long-distance anyway and my partner had a lot of personal work/growing up to do) and my best friend from college just moved out of the apartment we shared (basically for logistical reasons since I'm moving soon anyway).\n\nMy college friend group was pretty rowdy and I think we all bonded over a lot of bad decisions and toxic behavior. My best friend and I were pretty emotionally dependent on each other (and basically attached at the hip) and having her move out has been a double-edged sword. She moved in with another mutual friend we share, and seeing them get closer and begin to leave me out of things has been hard, but I was stressing out right before she moved anyway because of her emotional involvement in my life and how judged I was feeling (making snide comments about my break up and decisions immediately following, giving bad advice, etc.). She also exhibits some pretty self-destructive behavior on a regular basis that has always stressed me out, but I never found the courage or honestly the point in saying anything because her tolerance for criticism is 0 and our whole friendship was kind of centered around \"not judging each other\" and \"understanding\". I also don't see her changing solely based on the fact I have an opinion (yes, even though we are \"best friends\"), so it doesn't seem worth the drama and bad-mouthing I know will happen.\n\nIt's also been rough during this gap year to go out with friends to the same old bars, watch everyone hook up with the same toxic people, gossip over the same boring bullshit, etc. I know that the next stage of my life is going to require a lot of independence and focus, and a lot is going to have to change with my old friend group (including staying away from some of the craziest ones). Yes, I'm moving to a different city, but a lot of them are from there and are either moving back or visit a lot. They are really the only close friends I have right now and the main source of my social life, which is a problem, but it's where I'm at.\n\nBasically, I'm looking for advice on how to feel okay with saying no to them/my best friend sometimes and successfully distance myself from this whole thing without totally cutting myself out of a group that I was pretty close with and did have good times with for five years. This would mean a lot more time alone and working on myself, which is what I need to do anyway to prep for school, but I don't want a whole bunch of drama to surface because it seems like I'm feeling \"better than them\" when I'm really just trying to be a better version of myself.\n\nTL;DR: I'm starting med school soon and my college friends (best friend in particular) are toxic. I need advice on how to feel ok about distancing myself from that even though it's the only social life I currently have.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

My best friend was this girl, let's call her Maddie. We were best friends since 6th grade (I am a 23 year old F btw). Then, we both happened to be going to the same out-of-district high school after middle school. We didn't know anyone there so we just stuck with each other. We spent every waking second together! \nThen college came, and we both went to the same small college too. We didn't hang out as much, although she would reach out to me more than I did. But we still were close, we talked all the time on the phone and relied on each other for emotional support. She helped me tremendously through a big breakup 2 years ago. And that was around when we drifted apart.\n\nShe broke up with her long time boyfriend and moved away from her controlling parents/abusive dad. She now lives in another state, and seems to be partying 24/7. Maddie is GORGEOUS. Like, model-status, Instagram baddie gorgeous. Guys flock to her and she's loving it. All of her social media show her at crazy parties on yachts and drinking champagne (her parents are extremely wealthy). \n\nAnd now she almost acts like I don't exist. She doesn't reach out to me anymore, and she's been to my town on multiple occasions without letting me know (I found out from social media). And one time I did see she was in town, so I reached out, but she bailed multiple times and we didn't see each other. \nBut she still \"likes\" all of my stuff on social media, and will even comment or message me and say stuff like \"you look so beautiful in that picture!\" But if I try to continue and turn it into a real conversation, she doesn't reply or keeps answers really short. I only see her hanging out with her \"party friends\" and she's seemed to cut out all of her older friends who know her best. \n\nI'm heartbroken and confused by our broken friendship. We had SO much fun together. I like to party too, but I also love deep conversation and spending genuine time with people. That's what I thought she was like too. We never had a dull moment and we've helped each other so much in our lives. I don't know what to make of all of this. What's her deal?

However, ultimately, I didn't really meet anyone  looking for the same thing. Either a) our timezones were incompatible or b) they weren't quite looking for voice chats. So I thought I'd try again and be a little more specific :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best times for me to speak are between 9pm - 12 am Mountain time (UTC -6), though occasionally I can do 9-12 am. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, why am I looking for voice chats? Well, put simply, texting just doesn't do it for me. For me, it's more about quality than it is about quantity. Sure I can have 5-10 simultaneous text conversations going but I'll be honest, it's hard for me to keep up with them all and really get to know any one person and remember them personally--it just really doesn't lead to me feeling like I'm really getting to know someone and thus, doesn't help very much in regards to not feeling lonely. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I'm looking for someone that would much prefer voice chats as well. I think I'm a pretty good conversationalist so if you'd prefer, you don't have to say much and I'll do all the talking/asking questions. Conversely, I'm an excellent listener if you just need someone to hear you out! So, if you're just looking for someone to actually decently get to know and be able to reliably contact and talk about your day with, I'm your dude!

I was friends with someone for 10 years. Yeah, a lot of it was during a time where we were immature and didn\u2019t take life so seriously but some of it also was during a time when life got hard. She dealt with an abusive relationship and I was the one constant in her life, and I was diagnosed with cancer younger and she was my rock, among other support friendships and family members. Regardless of the ups and downs we always found our ways back to each other. We lived together successfully, I\u2019ve heard some horror stories of friendships ruined due to living together and when it was just us things were fine. Unfortunately when we added an outside party when I introduced into our friendship that\u2019s when things began to become uncertain and rocky. This I introduced into the mix was someone I believed was a true friend,someone you instantly click with and share interests with. On top of that she clicked with my best friend. It was amazing, the outside friend, needed an out to her miserable living situation and my best friend and I needed a new lease/living situation. So all in all, the stars aligned and made way to us living together. The first few months were awesome. But then things began to crumble, my best friend began to distance herself from me, I also had started to seriously see someone, that someone is now my husband. I didn\u2019t know what I had done wrong but she had an automatic aversion to him. Outsider friend had shown approval to my boyfriend and I grew closer to her. A rift began to show between me and my best friend but I tried my best to include and integrate her into my new relationship but she wouldn\u2019t have it. \n\nI began to also distance myself as the outsider and my best friend began to bully me. I slowly started to move out of our living situation and even began to not include them into my life (I hesitated to tell them I got engaged). They had successfully made me feel miserable and sort of suck the joy out of me being excited to get married to the man of my dreams. I eventually attempted to reconcile our friendship because 10 years is a long time to be friends with someone, especially because I couldn\u2019t picture myself getting married without her beside me.  \n\nShit fell threw, she backed out a week before my wedding and I\u2019ve never been the same since. I feel like I\u2019ve been going through this perpetual break up with her. I attempt to reach out to her and show support from afar and she basically responds with one word or less. \n\nMy main question is, if you\u2019ve read all of this, how have you moved on with little to no closure from a friendship that\u2019s meant a lot but destroyed you at the same time? I say destroyed because I\u2019ve always been the friend who has cared more than she ever has.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We're all in our late 20s/early 30s now and about half are in serious relationships, nobody has children or is married yet, but a few have bought houses and live with their significant other. I feel like I'm back at college. My partner and I are living together, and are planning to get married and have children soon. \n\nIt makes me sad because I have known these people for so long and have some really amazing memories with them, but feel like I'm in danger of losing a significant number of my friends, but I have nothing in common with these people anymore and I don't enjoy spending time with them. \n\nI would like to make new friends but I feel like this becomes harder as you get older. The people I work with are mainly 20 years older than me and although we get in great at work I wouldn't socialise with them that much. \n\nTldr: longtime group of friends acting like college students, finding it hard to relate to them, but sad at the thought of losing them.

{"post_id": "bg6ptu", "created_utc": 1555963695, "title": "I feel left out from my friends, and I feel like they are lying to me. Do I care too much about this?", "author": "Felle885", "self_text": "So I can say that I am in a pretty weird situation. Everything began with a girl that I knew a while back ago, and we started to become friends and talk over snapchat lots of times. I became pretty interested in her, but I was pretty much trying to recover from a past relationship that broke up and she cared about me and gave me advice to move on from on, or how I should approach the situation. Anyway, so later we met a guy 2 years younger than us, (I will refer him as guy 1) and we decided to create discord group and I think we spoke like almost every day in that group chat since December. This guy, well he became interested in this girl too and I could see it in his actions and the way he flirted with her but he always had irony as excuse, and my crush's humor is almost reliant on irony so she flirted back. Anyway, I always thought that she was interested in him, but me and my crush became so close that she became open about lots of stuff in her life and it was quite emotional. So we both made sure that we had to talk to each other everytime we felt down and we did. \n\nLater on, the guy added his friend (guy 2) into the group that is the same age as me and my crush and thats when things went pretty south. Basically, later my crush and the guy 2 started flirting with each other, and guy 1 got jealous so he pertty much spoke to me in private about his feelings towards my crush, and that he regretted introducing guy 2 to our crush so I gave him advice to calm himself down because he has a tendency to go from happy to depressed and low self esteem very fast, and I also told him that I was in love with her too in the past, and that I also got sometimes uncomfortable when they flirted, and I told him that so he could understand that I can relate to him and that he should take my advice in order to avoid the awkward situation or being uncomfortable. Anyway, later he told her and she rejected him but still wanted to stay friends with him and she spoke to me about it because she always comes to me in private when she wants to talk about deep stuff, or wants advice or wants to be heard. In the end, I confessed to her that I liked her before because of a few reasons, and she told me that she was interested in me too very much but that she didn't want to go for it because I was still not over my past girlfriend. Pretty shocking, right? But anyway, she felt guilty for not having the same feelings towards guy 1 so I tried to talk her out and guy 1 moved on pretty fast from it, but became less social from the group than before which is understandable. I still think he is quite interested in her, but I don't know much anymore. Anyway, since I told my crush that I only liked her before, she still likes to talk about the guys she is interested in, or curious about and she mentioned guy 2 this time and she pretty much spoke to me about him and asked questions like \"Is he really interested in me?\", \"He has opened my snaps but hasnt responded in 5 minutes what should I do?\", and I helped her which I think was probably a bad idea. Months later, they spoke more in the group chat, they flirted and shit like that and even though I am friends with him, he became like my competition in a way. She did say that I was the most good looking out of all in the group which is a good thing, but I became more uncomfortable when they flirted and when she didn't quite take my compliments, so I left the group sometimes to get \"space\", and later I confessed to her that I still like her, and that I left because I know she is interested in him and that I got quite uncomfortable and she told me that she understood and If I wanted to talk about things, she would listen. I later joined back in the group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are all still very amazing friends, but I have noticed lots of times recently that my crush and guy 2 are talking privately more often now. He knows almost as much now about the deep stuff and private stuff as I do, and whenever she is down I always try to talk to her, and tell her that if she is down and wants to talk I am there for her but she is always saying that she is fine when she is not, and explains more to guy 2 now which kind of gives me a feeling of being replaced in that role. When I have no one to talk to I ask if they wanna talk, but instead of saying they want to be left alone they are lying that they can't right now because they are doing stuff with their family, or studying even though they are listening at spotify together which they always do when they talk, and they respond exactly the same time on snapchat and shit like that. When I wanna talk nowadays in the group chat, no one really responds or say that they cannot, but when they ask or call all in the group joins. Before when I was down, my crush would always ask me how things are, but she barely does it anymore even though I always ask her how things are, even the other guys when they are down. None of the guys want to talk to me alone, because they always make excuses when I am left alone in the call with one of them that they have to go or that they want to study or do something else. I never really end up left alone with my crush anymore in the same call, because everytime we talk in the group, guy 2 is always there till she goes and when he goes, she has to go. There have been times when I was supposed to play with my crush or watch something with her but she mostly pushes it back or forgets about it and talks to guy 2 in private without me knowing.. I don't know, I feel like a second priority and I feel like they are lying behind my backs to get alone time or don't wanna talk to me. I haven't confronted them about this even though they are my close friends, I don't wanna come off as insecure or that I complain too much, but I have told my crush that I feel like a second priority sometimes but she goes and says \"I always wanna talk to you, and I wanna talk to you as much as them\", but sometimes I find it hard to believe in this stage, and that she only says it to make me feel better. Do I care too much about this? What would you have done? I have heard that you should never just avoid your crush even though you know that they are not into you as much as someone else, and guy 2 is my friend too but it feels so weird sometimes to be in the same discord call with them, and for her to pay more attention to him, or have his webcam in full screen when we all have our webcams on and stuff like that. Pretty weird situation, and me and my crush are almost best friends, but she has told me that she feels more comfortable being around with me than anyone else because we know each other the longest. Is that something good? I don't know, tell me what you think. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading or atleast trying.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "bg859o", "created_utc": 1555971052, "title": "My dog died a couple days ago", "author": "Zmorrison2112", "self_text": "I was 15 and going into my sophomore year of high school when we adopted my beautiful golden retriever named Holly. We first met her at my dads coworkers house in which they run a golden retriever rescue out of. Holly was inside with a much older golden while all the others were out back playing. Holly didn\u2019t like all the rowdiness from the other dogs so she got to stay inside during the day with the older dog and that\u2019s how we met her. As soon as we walked in she would not leave my side. Constantly pawing at me for more pets, she was as sweet as could be. That\u2019s when we learned she was looking for a home and my dad and I looked at each other with the same thought, she is coming home with us. \n\nOver the next 6 years she would become the light of my world. I took her everywhere with me. The lake, fast food runs, coffee runs, any restaurant with a patio. Pretty much any where a dog could go, I would take her. She would sleep with me at night, and then claw at my door the following morning at 8:00 am telling me she wanted outside. Anytime there was a thunder storm she would come barreling into my room and jump right on top of me because she hated the thunder. Everyone who ever met her loved her like she was a real person. I used to hear the same joke anytime someone new would come over... \u201cwhen you\u2019re not looking I\u2019m gonna steal her and take her home!\u201d She was quite literally the best dog ever. She radiated with sweetness and love, and didn\u2019t have a single bad bone in her body. She never even had one accident in the house the whole time we had her!\n\nWell, one year ago I had some friends over and Holly was making her rounds to all the guests charging her very strict \u201cpet tax\u201d that all guests had to pay. Everyone was obviously very willing to pet her and after they did, she would move on  to the next person. During this one of my friends asked me if I had ever noticed these weird lumps on her throat he felt while petting her. I had not and the next day we took her to the vet. We feared the worst, and the worst it was. Lymphoma. My sweet girl has cancer. How could this of happened? She was only 7 years old at the time we discovered it. I felt like I was hit by boulder and couldn\u2019t believe this was happening so soon. We found the best vet in our area that could handle this and booked an appointment as soon as we could. She fought hard for a very long time, some days worse than others. She was in remission after 4 months of treatment and I couldn\u2019t have been happier, but I knew not to give my hopes up. Less than a month after remission, the cancer was back. We played this game for about 6 more months where she would be treated, the tumors would reduce, and then a week or two later they would pop back up. Then the treatments started becoming less and less effective. My little girl started to hurt. She couldn\u2019t run around like she used to, she wouldn\u2019t chase rabbits anymore, and her beautiful soft fur started to change color and became wirey. \n\nBy this point I had moved away from home for college and didn\u2019t get to see her as often. Every time I would come home she seemed a little bit worse. My heart hurt so much seeing her like that. Then I finally got the text from my dad saying she was at her end. I went home immediately and when I arrived I saw her laying on the porch with my family around her. She was still alive but too weak to stand, eat, she could barely drink water when we put it close to her. It was 12:30pm and my dad told me the vet would be there at 3:00 to put her down. I spent that entire time laying there with her, petting her in all her favorite spots, talking to her. She would occasionally look up at me if my hand stopped petting her. I wanted to make those two hours last as long as they could. When the vet arrived I knew I had to stay with her.\n\nShe passed away in my arms. \n\nI have never felt so sad in my entire life. I lost my best friend, my angel, my dog. The past few days have been so incredibly hard, I feel like my world has stopped turning. Seeing the life leave her eyes has scarred me in ways that will never heal. I\u2019m crying as I am writing this. She wasn\u2019t just any dog to me, she was my whole world. I loved her with all my heart and this world took her from me entirely too soon. She was only 8 years old when she passed. This pain is too hard to take. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m posting this here because I thought it would help to talk about it with others, and I know this was a long post but I felt I had to make it.

For a good two years, if not more it seemed like I was pretty close with her. The four of us hung out most weekends, and even when our boyfriends were busy, Erica and I would still hang out pretty regularly. We texted almost daily, and things seemed peachy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt some point, one of my boyfriend's other brothers also got a girlfriend. Let's call her Tiffany. For a while, all three of us girls got along well. It was a little shocking actually because we were all fairly different. Over time, Erica and Tiffany started hanging out more and more, but all 6 of us (the boyfriends and girlfriends) could all hang out and get along.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's when I started noticing Erica's behavior becoming more and more distant. She stopped responding to my texts. In group chats with friends, she would respond to texts from other people but not mine. She's always claimed she's not a big texter, so I just assumed she was busy with school or whatever else. No big deal. She did start going off on her own with Tiffany whenever the 6 of us hung out though - leaving me to come up with an explanation as to why I wasn't didn't go with them. All I could come up with was \"I don't know. They didn't ask me to come with them?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to a couple months ago, Erica and I took a weekend trip with our boyfriends. While the boys were off doing whatever boys do. We chatted away as we usually do. I brought up how she was always running off with Tiffany, and how I was worried Tiffany might have thought I didn't like her or something. Another topic randomly brought up for discussion was how fun it'd be to go somewhere like Australia someday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following weekend, I texted Erica asking if she wanted to hang out that night. It turns out she was in none other than AUSTRALIA. Jokingly, I responded asking where my invitation was assuming she was there for work. That's when Erica sent me two texts from months earlier, from TIFFANY, suggesting we go on vacation for her birthday. Those two texts were the only time the trip was ever mentioned to me, so I assumed it was like every other girls trip we've briefly mentioned without ever following through with. According to Erica, Tiffany assumed I didn't want to go. Erica then added that my boyfriend knew about the trip so it was his fault I didn't know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I got a little frustrated. It was Tiffany's birthday trip. Why would it be my boyfriend's job to invite me, and not Tiffany's?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the week earlier, I had discussed both wanting to hang out with Tiffany more and going to Australia with Erica. I don't know about anyone else, but I would have had a really hard time not mentioning such a big trip, especially when we were talking about that very place the week before the trip. In my opinion, the only plausible explanation for not mentioning it was that Erica didn't want me to know about the trip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater that night, I mentioned the trip to my boyfriend. He said he only found out about it a few days earlier when he found out his brothers were also going, at which point it was too late to go. His take was similar to mine - it seemed like they didn't want us to know about the trip because they didn't want us to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow if that is the case, Erica could have come out and just said that. I'd have been disappointed, but I'd have gotten over it. But after thinking about the months of distant behavior leading up to the situation, feeling like she threw my boyfriend under the bus, and then failing to mention the trip, it all seemed to paint a picture of someone who wasn't actually my friend at all - just pretending to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to believe it so at the end of the day, I decided it was just one big misunderstanding and figured it'd blow over. We're dating brothers, so it's not like she could stay mad at me forever... right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNearly two weeks went by without a word from Erica. Clearly it wasn't just a misunderstanding. She was actually mad, but I still wasn't sure why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next time we were all set to hang out at a restaurant. I came mentally prepared to be friendly, polite, and ready to finally figure out what was going on. Instead, she and her boyfriend kept to themselves. At some point, her boyfriend came over to talk to his brother and I before we left. Seeing us talking, she stormed out of the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay. Erica's really mad. But still...why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI apologized to her boyfriend in case I had done something wrong, and to my surprise, he responded as if I had in fact done something wrong. Not wanting to get him caught in the middle anymore than he already was, I suggested he let me work things out with her directly. Unfortunately, he didn't. He asked my boyfriend to get involved. Thankfully my boyfriend was on the same page as I was and told his brother the same thing - let the girls work it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother two weeks go by, and it seems like the brothers have agreed to not get involved anymore, but still no word from Erica. Okay. She's really really mad...But still why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point start I'm starting to get worried because I know we have a big family event coming up that would mean all three couples along with other relatives being in the same house for not just a dinner but almost two full days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, I arrived for the weekend mentally prepared to be friendly, polite, and ready to talk if she was. My boyfriend and I both said, \"Hi,\" to her and everyone else, and without even an ounce of acknowledgement, she walked away. Okay. Clearly she's still mad, but thankfully my boyfriend and I had made separate plans for the night so any further drama was spared that night. It was at this point my boyfriend started getting frustrated with her behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day was worse. At this point, all three couples had arrived and settled in, and it was clear alliances had been made. If I walked into a room to hang out with my boyfriend, she walked out, and so did her boyfriend and Tiffany and Tiffany's boyfriend, leaving my boyfriend and I alone. They actively avoided me (and by association with me, their own brother) for almost the entire day. Eventually, I was relieved to hear my boyfriend ask if I wanted to go home. The whole weekend left me feeling like I was back in middle school\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I don't know what to do. I'm at my wits end. With summer around the corner, we're only going to be attending more events together meaning this is only going to get worse if nothing changes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friends have suggested I stop going to family events until she comes around. My therapist suggested I talk to her, but she's made it clear she has no desire to do that. Now that she's avoiding my boyfriend, he's getting tired of it and wants to talk to his brother to put an end to it, but I really don't want them to get caught in the middle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice is appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Typo", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We used to play games on steam together during holidays and go watch movies and stuff. I kind of always had this underlying jealousy towards him because he was more socially liked and I didn't like it when he used to put me down for being lame or \"internet-backward\". As a result of these kinds of incidents, I grew really insecure of myself over the years. However, I always said to myself that if he really thought those things he wouldn't bother hanging out with me or even consider me a friend. This guy introduced me to reddit itself and used to show me memes and all, cause he was a pretty funny guy.\n\nBack in November 2018 I found his reddit account and (stupidly) decided to scroll through it, cause I figured due to his comedic nature his account would be filled with memeposts and sex jokes and the like. Well I was right about this, and there was some really funny stuff on there, so I thought i might subscribe to it (thinking reddit would notify him of it).\n\nFIRST MISTAKE: Assuming reddit would notify him that he had a subscriber, and since he knew what my account name was from months before, I never mentioned this to him over the phone or even in person.\n\nAfter a day or so I forgot all about the account and at the time I had to focus on university applications so I didn't use reddit as much as I used to anyway.\n\nMonths passed, we met up twice before the end of 2018 as I would soon leave my home country to further my studies elsewhere. \n\nAbout 2 weeks after settling in, I was bored one day and then I remembered that my friend had an account filled with memes and what not, so as I wanted to laugh a little I went back to his account.\n\nThen I saw a comment he wrote about someone who sounded a lot like me but in a negative light. \n\nAnd here's where my insecurities and jealousy rose up. I overreacted, and used my alternate account to fish for more information on who the person really was.\n\nHonestly speaking, it wasn't up until this point where I actually decided to go snoop around. But at the time I felt really disheartened that he saw me that way, so I decided to just do it.\n\nHe messaged me on my phone asking if the account belonged to me, to which I intially denied. I panicked and started deleting posts from my account which bore any resemblance to me in real life, as well as deleting a lot of (but not all) posts about my paranormal beliefs and my personal life which no one but me knew.\n\nThat night I decided I should come clean and tell him it really was me who replied to his comment. I also told him I found his account months ago and thought he knew I could see his posts after subscribing to them. I did apologize. He was angry, yes, but he said he forgave me and wouldn't look at the posts on my alternate account. I went to sleep at night feeling absolutely terrible but relieved at the same time that he was still my friend.\n\nSo imagine my shock and horror the next morning when he decided to post a snapshot of a remaining post from my alt account to a whatsapp group with another person in it. He also made fun of me for the posts and comments I had made on my account. \n\nLong story short, I then made a post about my feelings towards him since college, asking people if I was a jerk for feeling that way, on my original account, thinking he was done getting back at me and wouldn't check that account also. He later went to that account as well, saw the post and confronted me about being angry over \"petty insignificant things\" which he implied were never meant to offend me in the first place.\n\nNow everything had gone through the roof, and now he also thinks I'm a total weirdo for believing in the paranormal (he's atheist).\n\nMy dilemma is this: I really don't know if I want to be friends with a person who will never look at me the same way again because it looks to me like everything is beyond repair, but at the same time I miss having him as my friend because I've known him for yearsand we never had any big falling out up until now. I'm well aware I was wrong to do what I did and I wish I could take all of it back. It's something I'll never forgive myself for.\n\nIs there anything I can do to make this all better?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

All that time you spent with your friends and just discovering new things you enjoy about yourself all while hanging as person, do you not miss the old days when they are gone? When life was just simpler and any problem you had with any of your friends you could just see them at school and fix it. High school was simpler in both the curriculum and friends aspect. You come home from school do homework for a little while and then go out and see your friends. then there was the realization that once you got to high school you had more freedom than before so at first you respected the privilege and then later started to abuse it by sneaking out of the house and other normal teenage activities. In college it seems that making friends is very difficult compared to before, and the aspect of being in the real world makes you question what you want to do with your life. Do you want to go to college for four years and come out with a degree than find a simple 9 to 5 job for the rest of your life or do you want to capitalize on a dream you have a try to find opportunity their? After high school the possibilities are truly endless but you see the reality in this world. You really start to miss your friends from high school because now everyone is going on with their life and you feel as if you keep hitting a glass wall with the end in sight yet a obstacle blocking your way.

Now keep in mind I\u2019m an extremely shy kid at first because of past issues. I ended up staying in the bathroom alone until a older girl asked me why I was alone and I explained to her why, they (now with her friend) talked a bit of common sense to Sofia and Emily and they ended saying sorry and continued to hang out with me (and it was the most forced sorry ever). In October my best friend switched schools to mine and I introduced her to them (I\u2019ll call my best friend Rose) and everything was fine for a few months until a month ago, we (as in Sofia,Emily, Me and Rose) had this huge fight where S and E started to LITTERALLY bully me and call me a slut,liar,ugly, and a ton of horrible things. Why? Because I was apparently lying about being Spanish and English (I live in France, moved to France when I was 7, born in Spain, my mom is Canadian and my dad is Peruvian so I just say I\u2019m English and Spanish, I have a French and English last name, even though I\u2019m not French at all) and about being multilingual too, this was on a Friday before a two week break so like that I could relax a bit, they would follow us and taunt us that by the end of the day I gtfo of the school as fast I could and ignored the girls when they tried to talk to me, Emily had my phone number so she sent me NUMEROUS text messages saying \u201cplease I\u2019m sorry \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\u201d to me and Rose, we ignored all the texts until I snapped and told her as politely as I could that the next message she sends me I\u2019ll block her. (You can DM me to see the messages of you want to) she sent me a few messages from Sofia\u2019s part.\nWe never ended up forgiving them.., I mean NEVER, in any of these events, so explain to me why they started slowly hanging out with us when we came back from school?? Ugh. Anyways, last Thursday, they bullied us again, why? Well we where all eating at lunch and me and Rose where just talking, then I hear Emily say something mean about us, (keep in mind I we had just about had enough with those two) and I muster all of the courage I have even If I have that sick feeling in my stomach and said:\n\n \u201cC\u2019mon Rose, let\u2019s find somewhere else to sit\u201d \n\u201cWha..? Why-\u201c\n\nWe ended up eating somewhere else.\nThey taunted is for the whooolllee day, Rose was defending us while I just stayed there., silent. Until I eventually said \u201c can you PLEASE just leave us alone?!\u201d Then one shouted \u201cOH SHE SPEAKS!\u201d (Ill call her Mary, she hangs out with them sometimes\u201d I just got up and ran to the bathrooms while I also started crying, Mary tried to stop me and said \u201cWh-wait! I didn\u2019t me-mean that!\u201d But I just pushed her off me and screamed at her to \u201cFUCK OFF!\u201d (In English, I didn\u2019t mean to say it in English but when I\u2019m triggered like that I speak in English) and I guess she just stopped cause I had locked myself in one of the bathroom stalls. (I got triggered because I\u2019ve had very toxic friendships in the past and it just gave me memories I had suppressed) then they left me alone but gave me THOSE glances from time to time.\nOn Friday, I couldn\u2019t come because of stupid wedding I had to go to, so I was worried for Rose but she told me not to worry and that she would bring a book. I texted her the next day (at the wedding party) and asked her what happened and I swear to gosh I almost lost it when she told me that they started bullying her and annoying her non-stop for the whole day. And now I have my 2 week Easter break so I don\u2019t have to worry about them.. i thought. Well, Sofia started sending messages to Rose. I have blocked all the numbers I know are connected to them but Rose can\u2019t figure out how to block someone so I\u2019ll try and help her. I have no idea what to do so.. help please..?\n \nPS: We have had at least 2 other times I have not mentioned where they did almost the exact same thing, but I don\u2019t see it\u2019s necessary to put it in as it almost the same thing.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Just wanted to get this out there somewhere.If you are ghosted by a best friend - it will be ok and it is ok.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe met in June 2011 \u2013almost 8 years ago. I was in a pretty bad place in my emotional life but was finally coming out of it. I was hanging out frequently with this girl who for lack of a better word was fucking psychotic.  Excusing that fact, we would have fun together because she would drive around everywhere and introduce me to new people (and some cute guys) all the time. She was very outgoing compared to my shyness so this helped me meet people without actually having to put the work in. One day I got into her car and her friend was in the front seat. She introduced me to her, and I was a little skeptical. The girl was 2 years younger then me \u2013 and sure acted that way. I was a judgmental asshole to most people I met, so of course I immediately judged. I thought ugh this girl keeps saying \u201ccute\u201d to everything \u2013 how fucking annoying. She also kept talking about a guy she liked in a group of guys I had not met yet and knew nothing about. We ended up hanging out with them that day- and god was it boring. The three of us soon began hanging out a lot so I figured im going to have to talk to this person some more considering were seeing each other multiple times a week. One day Out friend was sick, parked up at fort Totten, she fell asleep and I was left to talk to her. We got into a deep conversation about friendship, and I felt somewhat bad that I at first judged and thought she was just another annoying girly girl that I looked down on. On another day, our friend spilled the beans and in front of her told me she liked me the best out of all her friends. I felt even worse about my initial opinion and decided to open up more. We became closer and even talked on the phone sometimes. I found out her real opinion on our crazy friend and felt like I could trust her on something that I had been hiding, and could not keep in any more. I told her I had hooked up with a guy our crazy friend liked. Not my finest moment and I wanted her to know I would never do that to a real friend. \n\n We hung out the whole summer, into fall and finally parted ways from our crazy friend after lots of drama. We still hung out with those guys, but it became the two of us going, and sometimes some of my other friends. My other friends became friends with her as well. She was funny and we would get drunk and just laugh and be idiots. I looked forward to every single weekend partying on \u201cThe block\u201d with the guys. We would get food, we would talk on the phone for hours, and had inside jokes. Some of my friends weren\u2019t fond of her and thought she was immature, but I assured them that there was another side that maybe not everyone got to see. The years went by, and we went through a lot together; Heartbreaks, crying to each other in person and on the phone, hangovers, just everything you could think of. We went through a period where we didn\u2019t talk for a whole summer, I was sad, but had my boyfriend to keep me occupied, but would look at the pictures of everyone hanging out, and I wasn\u2019t allowed to be there because we weren\u2019t friends. She would tell people not to invite me. I was hurt. By September she was told my friend she wanted to talk to me again. I was at my friends house, and conveniently she was at one of the guys house who lived in the house right next door. We became friends again and stayed friends for 4 more years ad talked basically every single day.\n\n During those 4 yeas, had more experiences. Partying \u2013 even making out once while extremely drunk. Birthday parties. Being there when we go through horrible shit; my anxiety phases where I couldn\u2019t leave the house. Late night walks in the city, or just in our neighborhoods. Just drinking a beer talking and walking around, going on last minute adventures. One night in particular id like to mention was in 2014 going into the village just wandering drinking and randomly seeing them film the movie Trainwreck. We were out till 4 am in the city when I had work the next day. I miss those times so much. We went to music festivals twice to see my favorite band, and I came to see your favorite band. I told you things that I never told anyone \u2013 not even my own therapist. I shared so much with one person \u2013 as did you to me. We talked about our families and the verbal abuse we faced from our parents. We talked about so many private things and had countless of 4 hour straight phone sessions. You were one of my best friends. In mid 2018, you went through something that would basically change- and end our friendship. You were going through a tough breakup that you did not want to go through. During this time, I was going through a hard time as well with my anxiety and developing agoraphobia. I tried to be there for you as much as I could. I stayed on the phone with you for hours while you cried, I gave you advice. But I unfortunately could not be there physically due to the shit I was going through. You started becoming close with someone else, and that was ok. I knew that you needed someone that was more available, and she was there. I could feel our selves distancing at this time. Whose fault it was \u2013 I am not sure. Maybe it was mine for not being able to leave my house and do the fun things we used to do. But you had new people for that now. We talked about your nights out and dates on the phone. You came to my house a few times when I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. Your defense mechanism for dealing with the breakup, was to begin working out and becoming \u201cThe hottest person\u201d. I thought it was great to workout if it helped you feel better, but all the talk about being so hot, looking for attention online, posting pictures of your ass on instagram \u2013 and calling other people ugly (my real issue) to make yourself feel better rubbed me the wrong way. I could feel myself rolling my eyes and getting annoyed when you kept speaking about how hot you are. I understood that this was a way of you making yourself feel better due to the breakup and tried to understand that, but I think you could see that I was maybe getting annoyed. You began just doing things without sharing it with me anymore, which maybe I could understand now with the way I was acting. We hung out on Valentines Day (I was starting to get myself back to normal) and went to your house. I made brownies and you made penne ala vodka. This might have been the last time we saw each other, possible once more after this.\n\n In April 2018, I went out one day with another friend of mine. We just hung out in the neighborhood took some pics got some ice cream nothing special. You texted me that day and we talked a little. I posted the pictures of myself hanging out on intagram. You didn\u2019t like the pictures and I could just feel something was off. The next day I decided to text in a group text with you and our friend. You did not answer. I was confused but also somewhat angry that you were doing this over some instagram pictures. I wasn\u2019t looking at the big picture, the way we were already distancing and maybe your notice of my annoyance. Maybe for you this was the breaing point of our friendship. We did not talk for about a month- although you sure would look at my instagram stories. Your birthday was coming up and I was debating for days if I should say happy birthday. We hadn\u2019t talked in almost a mnth but it didn\u2019t seem long enough for me not to say it. You were in California with your new friend and I decided to say it. I anxiously waited for a thank you. You answered my other friends when they said it so I was sure you would answer me. You didn\u2019t. And that told me that our friendship was done. I waited about another month, and told myself that I would remove you from social media once you delete the birthday post you made for me a few years back. You deleted it, and I was sad and anxious but I made me decision. I deleted you, and once you noticed, you blocked me on everything. That was it. That was the end of our 7 year friendship. I had some trouble with it, but it wasn\u2019t as hard as I thought. I had lost long term friendship before so I knew what I was in for. This time I was 10 years older. And although I had the way things ended, I learned that it had to happen, as we were becoming two completely different people who valued completely different things. You told my friends brother that you dropped me because I was too \u201cnegative\u201d and you were trying to grow as a person. I was upset with this because I was going through a hard time in my life and didn\u2019t think it was fair to call me negative when I have mental health issues. You also posted a picture on your story (I did not see it, but was told) that I was in with another one of your friends, and you colored all over me to block me out. I again was confused, because I still to this day do not know what I did wrong. I understand that we grew apart, but to be so petty and post something like that really solidified that I was happy with this decision, even though I did not make it. You ghosted me and then continued being petty probably because I did the deleting. Even though this all went down I still think about the good times. I am able to look back and laugh and smile at the many times we had in the past, and acknowledge that you changed and put up a hard shell because of your breakup. That is how you dealt with it and even though I want to be petty myself I have to understand that. I was not the only one you ditched. You ditched basically everyone that is associated with me. You moved on and made new friends and seem happy. I have moved on as well and I am living my life, not feeling as I am missing something. This was something that had to happen, and even though I HATE the way it did, I have accepted it. Could I have sent you a long paragraph telling you all of this, absolutely. But I decided against it, maybe because of pride, maybe because of the fear you would not answer anyway and id be rejected again. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel about the situation. It crosses my mind a lot and I will probably always think about it. All things come to an end, and this is one of them. I do wish that we could have a discussion and end on better terms, and maybe that day will come. But as of now, you are living your life and I am mine. Its scary as hell knowing someone out there knows so much about my life. There is someone out there who is no longer in my life that knows almost every detail of my life, knows my fears, pains, and happiness. It\u2019s a strange feeling. But I guess that\u2019s life, and we all move on.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

She left without saying any word. And it hurt like hell. \n\nComing to the male friends, they always make a  huge fun of me. And today did everything which went far beyond the line. And it took all of my senses and willpower to not give up on myself and get done with my life. \n\nAnd I think that's the clear sign. I'm done with all this friend stuff. I won't ever try to initiate a friendship. And although I may live alone for next few years or god knows how long, I would wait for my partner to spend my life with (if I'm fortunate enough) but even if that's the case, I won't ever initiate because in the end it's me who's gonna cry and get hurt.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

In public I sadly don't have many friends and most are on here from Reddit. I've met some great people on here and I hoped I can meet some more interesting people to become friends with. Don't worry about those I'm already talking with I will still talk with you. Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nI just recently graduated from college with a degree in film. I suffer from both anxiety and depression. It effects me a lot on day to day basis mostly depression. Some days I'm fine Some I'm not. So if I complain about being depressed please understand I can't control it and at least be sympathetic towards it. Also it takes me time to open up to other so be considering of that. \n\nI'm a very shy, lonely and boring person. I have a hard time making conversation so I might be boring to talk to. I will try my best. I don't have much in life as I'm searching for work at the moment. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Game of Thrones, The Handmaid's Tale, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions \n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog obut would love one in the future. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03. If you going to message me I recommend you being around my age at least 18-26. Nobody younger or older to chat with cause I feel it would be awkward lol. I can make some exceptions. \n\nImportant please don't message me and then ghost me soon after it hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Also don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again. It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have kik, discord, and Snapchat but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now. Until we get to know each other more. I prefer the pm message box and not the chat but whatever works for you. So yeah just msg me your age, gender, and a little bit about yourself so I know you read all this lol.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I don't post on this sub a lot, but I tend to post on some other sub reddits and i've noticed a few things that get results. I hope you read this and it assists you.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1) Put your age. I get that you just want a friend, and you're not thinking about who they are, but it matters. I'm a 38 year old dude. I will never message ANYONE without an age on their post. \nWhat if you are 14? What if you are 60? Its so hard to relate to someone with that much of a difference. Also there is the creep factor people don't want to risk.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2) Put something you're interested in. Life can be hard, we all know this. Particularly if you feel you are in it alone. Even if you can't think of something you're happy about, people want to know you are more than just going to complain about how hard life is. \nDon't just put \"I like netflix\". Think about what what you like on netflix. Do you like Fantasy shows? Do you imagine what its like to live in that world? What show are you watching and WHY do you love it. It will give people insight into who you are as a person\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3) Don't complain about people on this sub. Being ghosted sucks. But honestly, sometimes its not ghosting but you just run out of things to talk about. Often friendships are intense and great for the first one to two weeks as you get to know each other. Sometimes things don't last past that. Sometimes they do. But if you just complain that everyone ghosts you, it sends the message that you are not interesting to talk to beyond that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n4) Tell people what you're looking for. Are you looking for someone to snapchat daily and send memes? are you looking for someone to hang out with IRL? Do you want someone to play 20 questions with? Do you love playing switch games and want buddies to play with. What are your favourite things in life and why do you want ot share them with people.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMake your posts stand out from the rest.

I see meta posts regularly on this sub and similar and frankly the meta posts are the best/only interesting thing about this sub. I've been on this sub for years and what I noticed is that a lot of posts are almost exactly the same as the ones before it. Mostly uninspired posts, like 1 to 3 lines, very little details and it's like \"Well gee stranger, you mind telling me about yourself in your personal ad?\" Quite a bit of posts are like \"I'm lonely/ kinda bored. If you're the same HMU.\" And good lord do I hate seeing HMU but that's only because I've been on subs like this for too long. \n\nSubs like this are a good idea but this isn't the first time people ruined good things. Like most of the time when you message someone they don't respond or they put in so little work you just ghost the person because you can't justify using more of your time with a conversation that's dead on arrival or the person isn't trying much or at all. I try not to ghost people but when talking becomes \"work\" I kinda don't have a choice and sometimes letting the person know you're not interested in talking to them upsets them more than being ghosted. I know a lot of people are like \"Let me know you're not interested before you ghost me.\" But do you really want someone to tell you they're not interested in talking anymore because you're boring or they don't think you're trying hard enough? That's a potential shot to your self esteem. Can't stand the reposts either because sometimes you actually start to recognize the title and the user so the only choice you have is to block the person so you don't see their posts anymore.\n\nI know people get on guys about preferring to talk to girls because they're easier to talk or relate to or some other excuse and even if they're not lying I just don't believe it. And guys get upset that ladies get more responses than them even though a lot of the responses are junk like \"I'm interested in video games, sports and working out, here's my snapchat\" or some copy-paste response that shows they haven't read anything. I don't see why someone would have the desire to have someone else's junk mail but okay.\n\nI know people are gonna be like \"Ugh, another meta post.\" and perhaps you feel that way because you don't understand how frustrating it is to be on a sub for over a year and encountering the same things over and over again. Like if you do something in hopes of getting an ideal result and it doesn't happen you have the right to be upset and dissatisfied.\n\nReddit is great for a lot of things but not for any type of relationship and there's nothing that can be done about that because it would require a lot of people that use subs like this to change and how likely is that?\n\nFrankly if you already have friends and they're not a problem, stick with them and try to improve your relationship somehow instead of looking for more people and if you have no friends maybe try some type of online game on your console or pc or something. It's not a guarantee that you'll make friends that way but there will at least be more enjoyment than doing so vs no responses to messages, boring conversations or something else unpleasant that you've become accustomed to.\n\nAfter this post. I'm not gonna use reddit for the purposes of finding friends anymore because it's just not worth it. For those that do stick around, good luck to you but don't expect much to happen.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

When you join you will have limited access to the server but everything you need to know to view the rest of it is *in the rules*. If you can't work it out, you clearly didn't read the rules well enough.\n\n* Hopefully once you've worked that out you have a good understanding of the rules. By gaining access to the entire server that means that you have essentially agreed to follow said rules. This means that any rule breaking could lead to a permanent ban. You can't say you didn't know.\n\n* Remember that like this subreddit; the server is for *platonic friendships only*. We will go above and beyond to maintain that, but if you see or encounter anyone breaking that golden rule, please send screenshots to any moderator asap!\n\n* There are two \"moderator\" like equivalent roles in the server. First and foremost are Admins, people with this role are the genuine mods of this subreddit. The second role is \"Mods\". They have just as much rights as we Admins do, however they do not mod this subreddit. These Mods are people who have gone above and beyond to earn the ability to run the server alongside us. Their voice and judgement is just as powerful as ours. Listen to them as you would listen to us.\n\n* The Admins/Mods are here for you and to help you, but please remember that we are people too and we are *volunteers*. The only payment we get from doing what we do is the satisfaction of creating a long lasting and wonderful community. We will always treat you with respect and like a valued member of our community; but we do expect the same in return. \n\n# Why join?\n\nWell why not!? With almost 3k members (and growing larger every day) that means that there's is almost 3k people seeking friendships just like you! We have endeavored to create a friendly community where you can chat to other members about anything you like! ^^within ^^reason ^^of ^^course\n\nBy joining our server it ensures that you can find like-minded people faster and receive responses far quicker than just waiting on your post on this subreddit to catch someones eye. It also ensures that you can get to know people somewhat publically before you take your friendship privately. It's much easier to make friends with people if you know a little about them to begin with, and this server helps serve that purpose exactly!\n\nWe offer a multitude of text channels to cater to your needs as well! Do you like sending and receiving pics of pets? Then #pets-and-people is for you! Maybe you want to have just a casual conversation? Try #general or #general2! Perhaps you're wanting to chat about some serious topics? #serious-subjects is the place to be! Are you a gamer seeking friends to game with? Try #lfg!\n\n##The server offers all of the above *and so much more!* So what are you waiting for?

We always joked about being the perpetually single ones in the group and talked about how we don't need men which is true; we're both very independent but that doesn't mean I wanted to be single forever and I know she doesn't because she's on loads of dating sites and has been on numerous dates. Anyway, in past relationships i've never been the sort to ditch my friends for guys, I try to find time for everyone because friendships are important, but since I started seeing this guy, my friend has grown distant and barely speaks to me. I always initiate conversations and when I do she shuts them down and doesn't even try to engage. I invite her to do stuff at the weekends, and try to talk to her about what's going on in her life, her hobbies etc to try and get her to talk but even then, I might get a few words out of her and that's it.\n\nIn the past she had a best friend who got with a guy and they fell out, with her claiming that the friend had dumped her for her bf but now I'm not so sure that's the case. She seems fine with our friends who have had partners since she met them but both myself and this other girl were always her single partners in crime and then when we were no longer single, suddenly we're persona non grata in her life.\n\nI'm really not sure what to do or say to her. I've spoken to my other friends to see if maybe it was me, if i had changed, or become more distant, but they all said that they hadn't noticed any change in my relationship with them, or my general demeanour except that I'm happier. So I'm really struggling to figure out what, if anything, I've done wrong.

We have gone weeks - even months - without speaking over the years, and we can almost always just pick up where we left off with no hard feelings either way. Life happens, and we both embrace that. We are also geographically very far away, and sometimes it is just hard to coordinate a friendship around opposite time zones.\n\nWith that said, however, sometimes I feel like I am there for her more than she is there for me, and it gets me down sometimes. \n\nI always know when she is going through something difficult in her life - a rocky relationship, a fight with her family, a hard time at work or school - and I try to be flexible and give her space when she needs it, and an ear to listen when she needs that. For what it's worth, she'd an ENFP, and tends to prefer to talk through her problems.\n\nI am an INFP and I process things internally, with very little outside influence. This mostly works for me, but there have been a handful of times in our friendship when I have actually genuinely needed her, and needed to talk to her, and needed to unload my problems a little, and almost every time, she buckles and peaces out. For example, she told me helping me plan my wedding was just too stressful, and she backed out after agreeing to be my MOH (she was miles away - all I really needed was her opinion on Pinterest once in a while. Absolutely zero 'planning' involved).\n\nAnyway, now we are both in very different life situations, and I know she is under a lot of stress, but I am also under a lot of stress recently, and I could really use my best friend to talk to. \n\nBut I'm struggling to know what my boundaries are. I don't want to push her (we are going through one of our lulls, which I know means she is stressed out), but sometimes I also resent the fact that I feel like over the years, even when I have had stuff on my plate, if she comes to me, I am quick to listen and make myself available for her. \n\nSometimes I wish she would do the same for me. Sometimes I wish she would just come up out of the blue and say, \"Hey, how are you really doing? You can talk to me about it.\"\n\nI am afraid that since I have always been such an 'internal processor' that maybe it is unfair to want that, and that maybe I am hoping that she'll read my mind. But at the same time, after my wedding, we did have it out, because I was hurt that I felt like she wasn't there for me, and I expressed some of these same desires, and she acknowledged them and things got a lot better and more balanced.\n\nLong post.

For everyone's sake, I'll try to make this (somewhat) brief.  \n\n\nI've recently found myself lacking in people to talk to, and with a *lot* of free time and I'm willing to try just about anything to help with the boredom. Unfortunately I have a pretty difficult time keeping in touch with the online friends I make doing the various hobbies I enjoy doing, so I'm trying to branch out, and hopefully meet someone new here of all places.   \n\n\nAll that said, if you're a chill person that has Discord I'd love to chat and get to know you. As for myself I play an almost unhealthy amount of video-games like just about everyone these days, I enjoy writing, I love just about all genre of music, I'm a very big fan of the SCP community, I watch a lot of Netflix and just media in general, along with being a wannabe Youtuber. With all that I also like to consider myself pretty open-minded with new hobbies or new things in general, I've been surprised by a ton of things I thought i'd hate before so I try my best to dip my toes into anything.  \n\n\nAs for any sort of \"requirements\" i have in a friend or however you'd phrase that I'm not too picky, I don't care if you're black, white, guy, girl, gay, straight. I would prefer if you were around the same age as myself of course but it's not really a requirement. Oh, also, my timezone is EST, which again, isn't particularly a requirement either for your timezone to line up with mine but for obvious reasons it would be preferable.   \n\n\nWell that's about the gist of myself, if you're interested in getting to know one-another please feel free to send a msg my way.

My cats are good boys but they are still cats, and scratch occasionally.\nMy roomie brought it up a while back and. I offered to move, she refused, partially because she wanted me to help pay for the rent.\n\nAnyways, now she is claiming that my cats have scratched up her chairs (I see almost no marks-maybe a tiny scratch mark on the leg) and that they have peed on her chairs and couch. I have offered to clean up any areas she thinks they peed and she refused saying that's jot good enough-she wants new furniture. I talked with her husband yesterday and found out that even if they didnt spray it doesn't matter, its the fact that she is disgusted by the thought of the cats being on the furniture. Also it might be important to note that my roommate is messy, leaves food around so her couch and chairs already smelled disgusting when she moved in. Now her and her husband want me to buy them new furniture. She screamed at me about this (she has a short temper).\n\nI said I am not opposed to talking about it. I am willing to pay for some of the damages (like the scratched chair), but things that can be cleaned I will try to clean and not pay for a new one. I am also not going to let them exaggerate how much the stuff costs or 'estimate' it, as these two have a long history of finding ways to make me pay more than my share (lots of issues with rent and such) .\n\n I also mentioned to her husband that if we are going to consider their furniture than we are also going to consider the damage she has done to my car. She was angry with me about the cats, wanted me to leave for a few hours to get a break from me (her husband paid me but I don't think she knew that). Screamed at me for being outside the house for too long trying to decide where to go, and picked up a big rock and threw it at me. It made a small dent on the hood of my car. Her husband is saying its small and vlbarely visible which is true, but if I am buying them new furniture I feel that its only fair that I get to have someone give an estimate of the cost of that dent and subtract that from whatever we decide on the furniture. I think this is more than fair since I am not even considering the fact that she could have seriously injured me if she didnt have such bad aim.

I\u2019ve lost friends overtime of course but they were due to us just growing apart, no real hard feelings and we weren\u2019t too close to begin with. But with this ex friend of mine, we can call her J, she was my best friend. I trusted her with absolutely everything and I never foresaw our friendship breaking. We were thick as thieves, J and I. She became a sister to me. But we broke. I still love her, but she did teach me that friendships, no matter how close and strong they seem, will break and fade. \n\nFast forwarding to today, I have a new friend. Let\u2019s call her L. L and I talk daily, we have interesting debates and conversations and are really equal with one another. It\u2019s refreshing and invigorating. However, she does have a tendency of being upset with me and I at her. Neither of us is the good nor the bad side I would say. But because of our constant arguing I\u2019m afraid that our friendship will soon cease. \n\nL and I tell everything to each other. We know each other\u2019s secrets and ideas, and I\u2019m beginning to regret telling her mine. When she gets mad at me she will tell other people things I\u2019ve told her in confidence and it is quite upsetting to me. I\u2019m scared that if we stop being friends she will tell people about what she knows about me.

I am a M[16] and she is a F[16]. Maybe we\u2019re to young who knows. But I don\u2019t date to fill a void or for sexual activity\u2019s. I believe that I\u2019m very respectful towards women. I also only date people because I like them enough as a person to see a legitimate future with that person. That being said let\u2019s talk about this girl. For now I\u2019m going to call her \u201cT\u201d.\n\nSo me and T meet while working together at a fast food joint. We still work together and I have a lot of fun usually when working with her. Maybe a month ago I was told that she was interested in me. Everyone exchanges phone numbers incase we can\u2019t come in for a shift or something. So I text her and we start talking. At this point I had recently ended a toxic relationship with a friend that doesn\u2019t talk to me much anymore because of it.\n\nAfter talking for a little bit by the same person she wants to go to prom. So I muster up the courage to ask. We\u2019ve been talking and we have had a lot of fun. Up till 2 days ago. I struggle with my mother we fight a lot I also have a hard time hiding my emotions. I also struggle with depression (though I haven\u2019t been properly diagnosed) and self-esteem. The past week or two I\u2019ve been struggling with my mom and it\u2019s been showing at work and school. It better now. But again 2 days ago something changed. \n\nFirst of all I would like to say I\u2019m a pale skinny white boy. While T is a beautiful Samoan Girl(She\u2019s brown) so we have different cultures that we\u2019re still figuring out. So I was just about to message a friend to play some video games when I get a Text from T. It read out \u201cSo wassup? U gotta problem with me or sum shit?\u201d\n\nI was immediately confused I didn\u2019t understand what she meant. In all reality she seemed to have a problem with me. A couple minutes after the text she called me saying that I\u2019m a great person but I don\u2019t think this is going to work out (Were not dating btw) now I\u2019m not really the guy to fight back. I responded with something along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t really agree with you. I think that we can we just need to figure out what the real problem is, but if this is how you feel and your not wanting to budge then I respect that\u201d\n\nWe continue talking and it ends up being a list of things I need to change myself for the better. Which I agree a lot of these things I could work on. Here\u2019s the list\nLeave problems at home, Put in more effort, Be the man I need and T needs,  Grow up, Think before you take action, Give yourself some credit, Be more considerate, No more complaining just to complain, Be more positive, Be a Leader, You only get what you want only if you put in the effort, Learn from the past and more forward.\n\nA lot of these are reasonable\n\nBut then I was browsing Pinterest yesterday (Lol I know) and saw this quote image about Eeyore from Whinny the Pooh. It says this \n\u201cOne awesome thing about eeyore is that even though he\u2019s basically clinically depressed, he still gets invited to participate in adventures and shenanigans with all his friends. They never expect him to pretend to be happy, they never leave him behind or ask him to change. THE JUST SHOW HIM LOVE!\u201d Now I\u2019m thinking I get she wants me to be better and stuff be should she really be trying to change me. Maybe I\u2019m just confusing myself. \n\nAgain I do except working on and will be working on those things. \nBut what I need to know is this something I should be excepting as Ok for someone to do in a relationship. \nThanks to anyone who is able to put in input \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude0a\n\nTD;LR\n\nGirl who likes me is telling me to change in a good way but I\u2019m not sure if this is a bad sign or not", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Its just that this guy is really nice and I feel like he is something I created out of a laboratory lol. Hes showing me new ways to express myself and figure out who i am in life considering my parents health. They're not always going to be here and im starting to realize how to adult more properly. Hes even taking the time to teach me how to drive. That's not something previous partners have taken the time to do for me. That small gesture says alot and its not just me he looks after. He even went the extra mile and helps out my parents. He teaches me on how not to be afraid of things and I feel like I can grow as a person and I haven't ever felt like that in my life. It's why I don't like when some people are like \"already that was fast\" I mean I am not hurt over my ex anymore and I shouldn't care what others think it's my life I saw this opportunity of this guy right in front of me and I took it before anyone else does am I really wrong for moving on so quickly when I took the time to think about moving forward with this guy. My parents absoulty loves this guy my dad never talked to my previous ex bf's like he does with this new boyfriend of mine. Heck my mom was so happy for him that I said yes on being his gf and she gave him a big hug cause my boyfriend was happy that I said yes.  Seriously am I wrong for moving onto a relationship so quickly? I feel bad cause my friend is mad at me I would of thought that a friend would at least think \"if it makes her happy go for it\" instead my friend is just really pissed off at me for it and I can't make my friend understand but now I just feel bad for being happy with this new boyfriend when my friend is mad at me for moving on so fast instead of focusing on myself apparently.

She is currently going through a divorce with her husband of 13 years. So when she came to me, I felt sorry for her and I became her friend. Then I made an even bigger mistake, the company where I work was hiring at the time, and my boss will let us be flexible (it's just a small business in a small town and there's only 4 employees here altogether), so I thought it would be good for her to work here because she has 3 kids all different ages and in different schools so she could work around her kid's schedules. I was only trying to help her out, then all of a sudden she decides we're best friends. I thought maybe she was just feeling lonely since she and her husband broke up, so I tolerated it, but I never agreed with her that we were anything like best friends. She still assumes I'm her best friend and that's what she goes around telling everyone. Like I said, I tolerated it for a while, but now my patience has run out and I'm not sure how to get her to leave me alone, especially since I see her every day at work, and she currently lives literally around the corner from me. She has told me so many lies about her husband, which I pushed aside for a while because I assumed she was just angry, but it's been a year and the lies still haven't stopped. I tried to gently call her out on her lies, like telling her that I think she's upset and is exaggerating a bit, but to no end. She is always asking me for my opinion on very sensitive things, like what I think about this man or that woman, but I don't tell her anything because she has done the same thing to other people, only to go tell this man or that woman what they said about them. She is also often playing the victim. I understand that life happens and sometimes life sucks, but she plays out every situation to make it look like everyone on Earth is against her. Everything that ever happens to her is always everyone else's fault. I've started to just ignore her remarks but it's hard to ignore her when she's literally shadowing me all day. And since this is a small business that I work at, it's hard to ask my boss to move her, because there's really no where else she can go. The other side of the building maybe? And when I'm not at work she's always either coming to my house and bringing her kids (I have a dog that is not good with kids, by the way, which I warned her many times but she still ignores), or she is texting me constantly. I have already blocked her number twice, only for her to change her number to text me again. She has been referred to therapy because of pathological lying among other things, but she refuses to go. I tried to convince her to go, but she argues that therapy is for mentally unstable people, which she is not one of. She is a huge drama queen, and she is always wondering why people are always blocking her number and stopping talking to her, but she doesn't realize even when people tell her to her face that they can't stand her lies anymore, that they must be the ones lying because she thinks that she cannot tell a lie. I'm just really stuck in a very stressful situation and I'm not sure what to do from here. Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I've always had a small but nice group of friends who I could spend time with, and I always have. It's kept me from experiencing loneliness. However, we've never talked about anything \"real\". I guess guy's don't really talk about feelings and emotions. So when shit hit the fan a few times last year, I reached out the these friends, and to my horror none of them responded the way I thought they would: with sympathy, understanding, advice. Not one of them called me and said \"hey man that's rough, let's grab a drink later tonight to talk it out\". I was mortified and furious. These were people I'd known for 10+ years. The best advice I was given was \"here's a suicide hotline\". \n\n\nSince then I've kind of shunned my \"friends\". Even when they message now it's never \"hey you feeling better?\", it's just about the newest video game or movie. I've isolated myself from them on purpose. And as a result, I'm experiencing what true loneliness is. It's devastating. BUT, at the end of day if I really do what companionship I know I can get together with them and hang out. \n\n\nMoving forward, I've been doing all kinds of searching across the internet for resources, reading articles, watching videos, books, etc. about mental health. One of the things I've noticed is that a lot of people going through rough times don't have any friends to talk to, or even people they can go out for a dinner or drinks with. This makes me incredibly sad. What the hell is wrong with society that friendship, or even companionship, is so hard to come by? \n\n\nI feel so guilty for having a group of friends that I can talk to and spend time with. I wish that I could be a real, live friend to all those lonely people, but I'm just one person. I'm convinced so much mental suffering can be extinguished if people just had ONE friend they could talk to or spend time with.

I\u2019m not really much of a gamer or an anime fan or anything like that, but I\u2019d love to try out some of your recommendations. I\u2019m a very emotionally intense person, and everything that I feel is cranked up to 11 - happiness, sadness, love, insecurity, etc... I\u2019d say that my outlet, my therapy, is in art (poetry and music, specifically). I love writing, and I love being able to express my emotions in a way that\u2019s tangible and enjoyable to other people.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that I have nobody to enjoy it with, though.\n\nThe last thing I want is pity, but to be honest, I literally have no friends. Nobody talks to me at school, I eat lunch alone, and I can\u2019t remember the last time I got a text from someone outside of family. It\u2019s not that I haven\u2019t tried to make friends, either, but they always leave; they tell me I\u2019m too sad, too clingy, too... whatever else. I\u2019m completely isolated from the world at this point, and even though I\u2019m used to things being this way, all I want is somebody I can depend on.\n\nThis might sound selfish of me, but my perfect friend would be somebody just like myself; isolated, sad, and friendless (and preferably 18 and under, please). I\u2019ve given pieces of myself to people before, and it always seems like there\u2019s somebody they\u2019d rather be talking to than me. I would love somebody with whom I could give my complete and undivided love and attention, and who could do the same for me - where I have you, you have me, and that\u2019s all that we really need. You and I might be alone, but at least we can be alone together, right? I would text you every day, and always make sure you feel wanted, and most importantly, I would never leave you, ever. \n\nMost people aren\u2019t into something that intense, and I absolutely understand that - and really, I don\u2019t blame you. I really don\u2019t expect much response to this, honestly. But if you\u2019re someone like me - protective, clingy, and maybe even a little obsessive, then congratulations - you just met your new best friend.

The friend I'm talking about is in my hometown, where he's the only friend I have (not because I'm a loner, but because most of the friendships just weren't interesting for both sides). I'm currently in school in another city and have multiple friends here, and only come to my hometown for summer break.\n\nThe story is, I always had a good time with that friend, however recently I caught him telling a lie to me. I do stuff in FL Studio and I'm guessing that he became jealous of it since after that he started telling me that he's making song lyrics. The ones he sent me first few times were weird, centered around topics he wasn't really connected with, so I decided to google them and ofc, they were actual songs. I kept going with the lie and he sent me more fake lyrics.\n\nAfter that I thought about some previous stuff and realized he lied more to me. For example, I had a channel with \\~500 subs (not much, but I also had a vid with 80,000 views) centered around one topic. He decided to make one too but his vids were trash. So he decided to tell me he made a new channel about a new topic, and when asked to show it, he always said no, despite how much I asked. I'm not a judgy person, I would just watch and enjoy and politely critisize. Now I realize there is no channel.\n\nHe told me his friends' music was used in eurovision. I don't know how I let that slide, but that lie is really stupid.\n\nHe also showed me and another previous friend videos that \"he\" made, which I researched and found out weren't his at all (he showed us 3), but that was long ago so I thought he wouldn't do it anymore.\n\nAlso long ago he told me he was buried in a grave and he had to escape. \n\nI'm fairly sure I'm missing a lot, but the other info he told me I don't know whether it's true or not (but I'm leaning towards them being lies, for example, he told me he was a part of a game pirate club, and a pretty big one)\n\nSo the conflict is, if I stop communication with him, my summer holidays will be boring af. He also knows where I live, so that may lead to something awkward. If I keep going, I will have NO motivation to speak to him first. What do I do?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I was a loner kid my whole life really and my only friends were my cousins (which I have 8 that are all close to my age). Anyways one of my male cousin (we\u2019ll call him Jacob) who was a sophomore at the same high school started dating a girl (we\u2019ll call her Madison) who was also a freshman and at our school. Since I hung out with my cousin all the time, me and Madison became friends. Less than a month later, Jacob and Madison broke up. This is where Madison and I became really close, we were always hanging out at her house after school and having sleepovers. We partied all throughout high school and were very best friends. We made some of my favorite memories and fun times I\u2019ve ever had. We were literally inseparable, just best friends. The kind of best friends everyone in school knew were best friends. Anyways she dated a few other people briefly through high school and would even talk to Jacob on and off. They started dating again around the time we graduated (and idk if I made this clear I absolutely do not care about them dating at all). While we did party a lot and go out with boys all the time together, it\u2019s not like I ever forced her to, she did everything at her own will. In fact she was even crazier than I ever was with boys. Anyways my cousin Jacob thought that I was the reason Madison was always being \u201cbad\u201d and drinking and smoking and going out all the time (Jacob is very weird and judgmental about \u201cpartying\u201d). So he wanted Madison to stop the partying. Which was fine with me, that\u2019s not even all we did we did things together sober all the time like shopping, or just watching tv, going out to eat, literally just chilling, etc. Jacob for some reason had it in his head that i was the bad influence on Madison and told her not to see me anymore, which she did. Since Jacob and Madison were so on and off again with their relationship, she would come and be friends with me for a month or two, always swearing that she would never get back together with Jacob and hated how he treated her, and then would turn around and go right back and completely cut me off and block my number for a couple of months. I know most people wouldn\u2019t put up with this, but at this time in my life I had lots of other friends so when she wouldn\u2019t talk to me it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, and I really do love Madison she\u2019ll always be my best friend, so whenever she needed me and wanted to be friends, I just didn\u2019t care. About a year after that of back and forth with her I did get tired of it though and eventually cut her off and blocked her. It\u2019s been about a year since I\u2019ve talked to her now and we\u2019re both 21. She broke up with Jacob, \u201cfor good\u201d, about 5 or 6 months ago. She\u2019s tried to contact me through Facebook wanting to be friends again (which I didn\u2019t reply). Recently I\u2019ve been thinking about her a lot and miss her and our friendship. I\u2019m thinking about messaging her and trying to mend the relationship. Is this a good idea? Should I go back to the person that has shown me that she is not a loyal friend over and over again? Can we even fix it and be friends again after all this time and after how many times she fucked me over?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Someone with an ideal they were willing to strive for; a part of themself they held-firm for someone special. Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of option, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

He has a horrible past history of abuse with her, and isn't the best parent either with what she's told me. She's somehow moved past this with him, but I've always kept my mouth shut that it's a huge mistake in my mind, and others minds, for her and her kid. But it's her relationship, her life, and her bad choice to make so I've respected it.\n\nWe were talking a lot about everything yesterday and once she offered, I tried to brush it off, and she pushed it again. I said \"I'd really rather not, unless I have to\" at first.\n\nI felt bad so I elaborated more and said \"I already don't trust new people or allow them into my home with my address.\" I still felt that wasn't enough because it was only a part truth.\n\nI eventually said \"I don't want to sound like a dick, because our friendship is important, but I don't know any other way to say this: (I wasn't sure if she remembers telling me) I don't know if you remember some of the things you've told me about, but with everything you've told me he's done, I don't have a good impression of him, and it would be very uncomfortable for me, especially having offered to help get you out. I'd rather pay a shitty friend. It's not that I would never be around him, I'm just very uncomfortable with the idea.\"\n\nShe hasn't really talked to me since, and tomorrow's supposed to be my birthday with her stopping by. We have a really tight friendship, where we've both helped eachother a lot over the last couple of years, and I feel she read the messages and simply went to sleep because it was late, but I'm worried I screwed the pooch saying that, because it's a line that once crossed, isn't uncrossed.\n\nI am a guy, she is a girl, at once point there was definitely mutual interest and to a point, still is but nobody ever acts on it. Me, out of respect for her current... Relationship, and her for her own reasons, some of which I can assume are fear. \n\n- Tl;dr: Told my best friend I'm uncomfortable with having her boyfriend help me move because of things she's told me about his poor parenting and abuse of her. She never responded (may have fallen asleep or not wanted to deal with it, it was late) and was supposed to see me Sunday for my birthday. Did I do the right thing being honest about my opinion and feelings about being around him, or should I have kept my mouth shut and not crossed the \"I'm not comfortable with him\" line and lied or told a half truth? How do I fix it if this upset her?\n\nEdits: For formatting and grammar. #mobileproblems", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I mean if you\u2019re bored then strap in. I know I should be trying to be short and that I should be sleeping or studying, but that basically translates to: I have all the time in the world, right? :)\n\n\nJust to get the basics out of the way :) am a girl, identify as one, have survived 22 trips around the sun, live somewhere with free healthcare, so yeah, not in the US, also free uni education (this probably narrows it down even more - go have a guess) but I function in all time zones. I just sleep too little. \nI suck at introducing myself. I never know the answer to the question \u201cwhat\u2019s an interesting fact about me\u201d. I sometimes like sleep more than anything and I tend to take a really long time to open up to people. Those are probably the biggest contributing factors to me not having close friends...or even just A close friend. (I also moved a lot in my life and that didn\u2019t really have a good impact on close friendships either.)\n\n\nI\u2019ve never met someone I\u2019d consider a friend online, but I thought if people can find their soulmates online then I might as well try to find a friend. \n\n\nI can\u2019t really say I don\u2019t have some nice people in my life who I consider acquaintances, but I\u2019m not that close to them. I\u2019m ok with them, I go to uni with them, get the occasional coffee with them, borrow notes or whatever. \nBut I haven\u2019t had a real friend in a long time. You know, the, sending-you-funny-memes, bitching-about-the-people-we-dont-like, talking-each-other-out-of-drunk-texts, talking-about-stupid-and-deep-stuff-sometimes-at-once type of friends. And I would really really really like to find someone who\u2019d be that. :)\n\n\nI am well aware that friendships don\u2019t happen just instantly. It takes time, and effort and compatibility. But I\u2019m open to try it. Also I\u2019m pretty much (my mum would say - sadly) always on my phone so I\u2019d say I\u2019m pretty decent at texting back :)\n\n\nI really hope to hear from you, dear soon-to-not-be-a-stranger-anymore who made it all the way through my impromptu novella. \n\n\nAlso if you need a talking point even after this long ramble: I love GoT :)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I used to have friends I could hang many days out of the week and feel close to them and have interesting conversations with them. That all changed when we all had to transfer schools after 8th grade to go to a college preparatory school. I attended Berkshire School, a boarding school in Massachusetts the following year where a shy part of my personality became dominant and my confidence in myself as a person and my social skills completely devolved. I had one friend who was a total dick to me and when I hung out with him and his friends they all made fun of me. During my time at this school from September to mid December the extent of my depression and anxiety increased dramatically, ultimately leading me to self harm and making preparation plans for suicide. Upon returning back from this shcool to home I have felt a drift, as if the world is not right. I dont feel happiness, pain, or presence with the world around me. After last year being a cluster fuck I repeated 9th grade at day school just outside of NYC where I live where the kids have less of a hype beast culture. I think a certain group of people in my school did not appreciate my ironically anarchistic personality and spread there dislike of me to other classmates, ultimately leaving me alone. My friends from middle school never hit me up, and I became socially isolated to the point where I no longer talked to chicks because my school is all boys and while I like many of the kids in the sophmore class kids who are my age I do not like many of the freshmen. Life feels like a drag and weekends are the worst. I sit alone in my bedroom trying to find some seth rogen movie to watch or follow hockey just to distract myself from how I feel about who I am. Now writing this reddit on 12:17 am alone with 4.5 mg of clonazepam in my system combined with light thc and alcohol. This is the only way I feel somewhat happy in life. On top of this I have never had the confidence to hook up with a girl despite various moderately beutifal expressing interst in me, It just feels as if the more I try to fix these problems with therapy and medication they only get worsel Honestly I just want my friends from middle school back because at this point I am done suffering from the loneliness and just whish for one chill dude to connect with me", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I have done a lot of thinking about how 2019 played out so far. My first ever post in r/needafriend caused me a world of pain. In february I met a girl (among others) on here who replied to that stupid post. I was in a terrible place back then, pretty close to finally giving up, thats why i made the post in the first place. (I got diabetes added to my list of problems and things seemed way too overwhelming)\n\nWell anyway, I was chatting with the people who responded and she stuck around, the conversation was great, we had lots to talk about. I think our chemistry was very good. Maybe I came on too strong with my problems, I don\u2019t know, but she asked and I responded honestly. But she didn\u2019t say a thing at the time and things continued as usual. I vented about a lot of things, stuff I never talk about to anyone, I thought I could be totally honest with her at that point. We did the voice chat, watched movies together, we spent a few hours on each other everyday. At the start I didn\u2019t want anything out of this, it was just an outlet for my pain, but I was happy with the friendship. I never had a girl friend I was this close to. So naturally I started falling for her hard, I knew it wasn\u2019t mutual and that it\u2019s not a wise move. I really didn\u2019t want to be heartbroken about a girl I have never seen irl, lives a few hundred kilometres away, so I started some soul searching and racionalising things in myself.\u00a0\n\nThis was about 2 weeks ago. I was extremely busy with school work, we had to finish our plans for an international architecture competition. From a 3 \"men\" group, a guy was MIA a week before the deadline. We had to redo everything in 5 days. So with all this shitshow going on, I told her I wont be able to talk, it has happened before when she was busy with exams. I told her about my feelings and that I know they are stupid but I value what we built together and I don\u2019t want to throw it away either. I will get over it and continue with being friends.\n\nThis is where things went south, I will try to condense things down. She told me doesn\u2019t reciprocate my feelings (not a surprise). But then she dropped the nukes, she said she doesn\u2019t even consider me a friend \"yet\" and that if I needed time for myself we should just stop talking period. It seemed like a huge overreaction from her part, it fucked me up, but i had no time to think about things. I still tried to be as nice as possible and let her go. Never spoken since then.\n\nNow mind you I was an emotional/psychical wreck from my new life style. Turns out not eating carbs at all is also bad for you. I was feeling super stressed and depressed, I wear a coat and a jumper in 25 celsius outside, I am still getting used to things.\n\nI wrote this shitty post because I wanted to tell her how much she hurt me. I felt like literal garbage at the time, like my friendship wasn\u2019t even worth waiting for a week to get my self together. I felt absolutely worthless, I was okay with being rejected romantically (I kinda rejected it too), but I was rejected as a friend too. We said we would be there for each other and all that nonsense. I still have all her contact information and stuff, I am thinking about deleting them and everything I have of her. I really don\u2019t want to do anything stupid like try and talk to her again.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Maybe I was too much for her/ i shouldnt have overshared?

At somepoint, L and T's relationship started getting bad. I took the side of L, and lost T as a friend. Throughout the next couple years we hung out constantly. We met each others families went to holidays together, helped each other through some toxic relationships with others. There was also this group of friends we'd hang out with from time to time who I also became close with and felt a strong belonging. It was the first friendgroup I felt welcomed to and a part of for probably the first time in my life.\n\nThen L starts dating someone in the group, let's call him B. B and I were pretty close, we had a little bit of a past (hooked up once or twice) but were genuinely good friends.\n\nI was so excited that my friend B and L were dating. I thought they were great, I thought B was going to be the best boyfriend ever to L.\n\nWell, repeat the last time L had a boyfriend. The exact same thing happened, their relationship went very badly, I loyally took the side of my female friend and ultimately cut off the entire group of friends by cutting out one of them. \nSometime after I wanted to talk to B because he was my friend before they'd started dating and I wanted to clear the air with him and also confront him about being a dick to L while they were dating. I asked L if that was okay, she said it was fine.\n\nNow fast forward to a month after: I've reached out multiple times to hang out and she's ghosted. She finally texted me once saying what I did by talking to him was extremely hurtful and she's sick of her friends taking the side of the abuser.\nI apologized sincerely and she has ghosted me completely.\n\nSo now, a year later, I have lost a total of 6 friends ultimately to for THIS ONE FRIEND and then she cut me out of her life.\n\nTL;DR: I cut out 6 friends from my life for supporting my friends abuser and was promptly ghosted by my friend on the grounds of supporting her abuser.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

You can call me Alex, and I'm seeking genuine long-term friendships.\n\nI have a rather classical interpretation of what defines friendship, being more invested in the friends I keep than is typical for most people today. I'm much more content with a few genuine friendships rather than a score of fairweather ones. So if you share a similar mindset stick around :)\n\nAbout me:\n\n\nI am an INTP/J type personality. I'm pretty pensive, reserved and soft-spoken; introverted but it doesn't always show. I light up when I'm engaging in discussions or activities about things I'm passionate about \u2013 that's a good way to see the more verbose side of me. As for other personal qualities, I am intelligent (gifted too), I have a well-rounded sense of humor, I'm very open-minded, I look before I leap, I used to sing and I loved it, I'm a night owl, I can be quite the wordsmith, and I might come off as a bit formal (though I can be more laid back when I'm less anxious.) I also love debating; the most satisfying part of it being when I end up changing my opinion, perspective or even worldview.\n\n\nInterests... For starters, I enjoy studying, pc gaming, pc building, listening to hi-fi music, meditation, aromatherapy, watching all kind of stuff on YouTube, Twitch and Netflix, and spending time with friends, family or pets. I also like reading, but I haven't been doing that as much as I used to (I'd appreciate help getting back in the groove of that.) I have cats now, but wouldn't mind taking care of a dog one day! Some topics that interest me include science, philosophy, politics, technology, space and documentaries.\n\n\nWhen it comes to what I look for in a friend I value a lot of things, but nothing that I wouldn't live up to myself. Honesty, reliability, compassion, authenticity, respect and some levity are all important to me; being thoughtful, supportive, and helping me out of my occasional funk. I surely wouldn't find it a bother to return the favor. I truly believe friends should help bring out the best in each other, and if a friend makes you feel worse then that's not friendship. I've had better luck making friends with women than men, but am open to friendship with either. \n\n\nI'm not at my best. I've got depression and anxiety, maybe PTSD (\u2026 child abuse) and I have a few physical issues that affect my ability to function at my best. The important thing is that I'm doing my best to get to where every one of those issues is well-managed \u2013 I am determined to become the dynamo I know I can be.\n\n\nAs for what I'm hoping to find here, I aim to make at least one solid friendship. One where we can communicate regularly, probably through IM, and maybe eventually voice chat. I connect best with people when I can get a sense of how it would sound be to converse with them in person. I'll chalk it up to my appreciation for all things auditory, as well as having a somewhat limited imagination. I would want to start messaging here but would like to switch to another platform for messaging later if that's more convenient, likely discord.\n\n\nI hope this all wasn't too formal or off-putting. But if you've made it this far (well, its almost an essay isn't it? :/ ) I'm almost done.\n\n\nIf you're interested in being friends, tell me a bit about yourself! (not 1-2 sentences) Please include enough to give me an basic idea of your personality/interests, why we might make good friends, and provide some interesting fact (or two) to keep the conversation going.\n\n\nI look forward to some delightful orange envelopes c:\n\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n~Alex~", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

No \"do I look good\" or \"is this okay?\" just random, uncalled for videos and photos. I humor her and say \"noice\" or \"you look good :) \" and she just airs my messages, and if I ignore them she gets mad. She also never stops talking about herself, and I'm too scared to ask her to stop sending me random photos and videos because she gets really angry over little things, and I'm not even that close to her! She does send the exact same thing to multiple people too, for example. My male friend \"James\" will receive these photos and videos and he just ignores them, which angers her. And before people say \"maybe she's trying to attract him\" James is gay and my friend knows this, so that is not a possibility. \n\nIt's just getting out of hand that I have to stop what I am doing just because she expects me to reply too her.

I've noticed that she is very frugal which isn't a bad thing, however I'm starting to feel taken advantage of and I'm not sure how to deal with it. \n\nI think I'm a quite generous person, I'll offer what I have in food wise or drink wise. I always offer some of what I'm having if I'm with a friend and if they've gone out of their way I try to compensate my end as I think most people do? More obvious things I've noticed before now: \n\n\\-She wanted to go somewhere and was going to go by train, she asked if I would go and I drive so I said I could drive us - this was several hours away. She did not offer me any petrol there or back, I was feeling a bit taken advantage of and asked her to get some snacks for us when I stopped. She went in and got dinner for herself, did not get any snacks to share or offer anything of hers. I didn't know what to say so I let it go. This was the first bigger one I noticed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- We went out for a dinner, I got out money to pay for my half but it ended up being $10 more than she had. She said  \"oh that will do\" and ended up underpaying, and didn't leave a tip. I didn't really think much about it until after and realised by how much I'd overpaid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Christmas. I got her a thoughtful gift, we agreed on a budget. She still hasn't given me my Christmas gift. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway:\n\nJust from a recent meet where we spent a good bit of time together, I took notice of her manners and how she is with money. \n\nShe came over, asked what I wanted - this is unusual - I asked for some wine from the store (We usually drink mine). She didn't bring any, said she didn't know what one I wanted. I wanted some wine so I got some out and she ended up having some. \n\nWe bought some tickets, I put the money on the counter with hers- she pocketed the change - including mine. This was only about 80 cents. I later reminded her about this when she asked me to pay $5 back for part of lunch. She rolled her eyes and said \"Come onn\". I got petty and gave her $4.50. I hate feeling so petty. \n\nAnother day she suggested we buy a wine each to share. She immediately picked the cheapest wine there and paid for that, I got a more expensive one. Again, not something I'd usually take notice of but it seems to be a pattern. She drank most of hers, I had a glass - then she drank half of mine. \n\nI bought some snacks, offered her some. She had some, she later took some of her own snacks out and started eating them. She did not offer me any. I ended up asking her if I could have some, I thought I'd try and speak up and she said sure then tipped 3 nuts in my hand xD \n\nShe said we are getting each other birthday gifts this year - I reminded her of that I still don't have my Christmas gift and she laughed and said Oh yeah!. We went shopping and I saw her near the fridge magnet section of the store. I got a bit suspicious that she was going to get me a fridge magnet for my birthday - I went over and said oh yeah I don't bother with fridge magnets, not my kind of thing and she said oh okay, I was going to get you this one. Literally the cheapest thing in the store lol.  \n\nIt's important to say she is frugal in general. She will order water instead of drinks to save, she will walk instead of taking a bus even for longer journeys, she will buy herself cheap stuff etc. \n\nThe issue now - how do I handle this? We have a birthday dinner next week with her and her boyfriend - going to a restaurant. She said we are getting birthday gifts for each other this year (our birthdays are fairly close together but hers is first). Any ideas on ways I can make sure the above scenarios don't happen again? I've already decided to have enough change to pay for our half of the meal, still not sure what to do on a birthday gift. \n\nI need general advice on how to manage this without getting a pooh pooh response and feeling petty and mean i.e. if I don't offer her some of what I have or whatever. I do enjoy her company otherwise - I just find it difficult to confront her over such small things, I feel petty and when I did say something she clearly thought I was being petty. Right now all the small things probably add up to a lot -  I have only listed some. \n\nI've never had to worry about this before so it's completely new territory for me. My other friends are generous and we'll give and take pretty equally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Extremely frugal friend takes advantage of me in monetary situations and I need advice on how to deal with it and maintain a friendship.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nI just recently graduated from college with a degree in film. I suffer from both anxiety and depression. It effects me a lot on day to day basis mostly depression. Some days I'm fine Some I'm not. So if I complain about being depressed please understand I can't control it and at least be sympathetic towards it.\n\nI'm also somewhere on the spectrum. Its not as severe as other people probably, like you wouldn't think I am because I'm smart.

I have a hard time making conversation so I might be boring to talk to. I will try my best. I don't have much in life as I'm searching for work at the moment. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Game of Thrones, The Handmaid's Tale, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions \n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog obut would love one in the future. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006.

Also don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again. It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have kik, discord, and Snapchat but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now.

{"post_id": "bikgta", "created_utc": 1556510918, "title": "I just don\u2019t know what to do", "author": "kool_kat23", "self_text": "So back in December me and my boyfriend made the decision to move out to Connecticut in hopes to find a better life with his new job he started. I have these two friends that I basically consider family because we literally knew each other since diapers. (Our mothers have been life long friends since) When I broke the news to them that I was moving they didn\u2019t really seem too supportive of it but still wished me luck. When I personally made the decision that I wanted to move out there I didn\u2019t really tell anyone about it until I felt I was ready. Even my family. Only because I didn\u2019t want anyone\u2019s opinions to affect the decision I had already made. The two friends I have live across the street from each other and they consider each other best friends rather than they consider me their best friend. But I never let that phase me. Because I don\u2019t consider them friends, I consider them more like family, or sisters. All our schedules are so opposite it was always difficult for some of us to make time for each other because one of us was either busy or working. But we tried when we could. When it was finally time for me to move to Connecticut, the only people I really said goodbye to was my family. When they found out I had already moved to Connecticut through a snapchat post, one of them messaged me saying I didn\u2019t hang out with them before I left and felt mad about it. It really surprised me when she said that because I honestly didn\u2019t think they were supportive of the decision I made cus they didn\u2019t really show emotion after I personally made the time to go over their house and talk to them about it seriously. Which made me kinda upset. So it surprised me when she messaged me saying that because I would think that if it made you this upset, why didn\u2019t you even try to make time to hang out with me or message me knowing that I was leaving!? I remember telling her my reasons and after I did she even screen shotted the conversation. (On snapchat you can see that) &amp; in my head I started thinking it was to show the other girl that lives across the street from her. And the crazy part is that she is actually my cousin. Anyways. Fast forward 3 months later, I decided to move back to my hometown because I felt that Connecticut was not working out for me income wise. The only people that knew of this decision was my boyfriend and my family. I haven\u2019t spoken with the girls ever since. I recently saw on snapchat that one of the girls, that I have known FOREVER (mind you again we grew up together since diapers) got married. I didn\u2019t know about it I only saw it social media. I even congratulated her. (Something she didn\u2019t do to me) Her family attended the wedding, my mother was even invited and attended. But I wasn\u2019t invited. She got married in court. Two of her friends were her witnesses, and I actually hung out with one of the witnesses this past weekend on a poconos trip (we have a mutual friend) I have no problem with her and the conversation about the wedding didn\u2019t come up. And I am glad cus I didn\u2019t want to start problems. It has nothing to do with her anyways. I started hanging out with these new group of girls and part of me wished they would\u2019ve been there to experience the poconos trip with them. My mom even told me about the wedding and she told me that her mother was angry with the bride (my friend) and told her that the witness should\u2019ve been me there for her!! Not the other girl that isn\u2019t even considered family to her. I also heard that they were saying how the reason they don\u2019t speak to me anymore because I left to Connecticut without saying bye to them or hanging out with them (mind you again I personally went over their house to have a serious conversation with them that honestly I don\u2019t think they took serious). And I told all that to my mom. She told me to just move on. So thats what I did. But it just gets me angry cus everyone\u2019s feelings are all over the place and no one wants to own up to them. They never say what they feel to me but they go off and say it to other people. And that makes me so angry. But after this poconos trip I can\u2019t help but feel like something should be done to mend these broken feelings. We are all so young (in our 20\u2019s) and I feel like this is the time we should experiencing fun times together! Just last year we went to Paris for my cousins21st birthday. And it was magical. I miss those times and I miss them, but I\u2019m also afraid that if I try to squash this, I\u2019m only gonna end up looking like an idiot, they\u2019ll probably act like they have no feelings and probably just go off and talk about it amongst each other. I feel like its 2 against 1. Sorry this is really long but it\u2019s been on my mind for a while and I hope some of you can understand where I am coming from. My boyfriend thinks I should be the bigger person and squash it, but part of me feels like they are just going to reject it and be against me.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

My name is Exelios(is not my real name, I don't go by it on the internet due to wanting to keep things light and a bit anonymous due to being paranoid maybe overtime i'll tell you), but people usually call me Ralzy due to my Discord name and the communities i've been around which are the Deltarune/Undertale communities, but I guess this is where I can start talking about myself a bit more.  \nSo for starters I really enjoy gaming, I have all platforms so if you want to play anything i'll most likely have the game you're looking to play. I am a very shy and sometimes reclusive person but if we were to keep trading conversations then i'm sure I can open up to you and be a lot more expressive, some people see me as cold, selfish, or that I just flat out don't care due to the fact I never message first or even greet, i've just had too much happen to me in the past.  \nAside from all that, if you were to message me first I will try and respond back asap since I am still free doing nothing, i've been trying to help people in my past time and being there for others so as i've said before you can vent if you need to towards me, i've been helping people since I was little so it's honestly alright with me! uwu\n\nI really, really love Deltarune and Undertale so if you're into that then that's awesome! I like to use my internet persona as Asriel or Ralsei, (basically 2 best goat bois) so if you were to hear me calling myself a goat that's just who I am, I really feel like I have the personality of those two characters, if you're also wondering what personality I classify as I am a INFJ there's a fun fact right there I suppose, another thing I want to talk about is when it comes to vc'ing, so i'm extremely shy when it comes to vc'ing new people and that's because my voice is just extremely weird to me, idk why but it changes pitches and sometimes i'll sound higher pitched or just really low pitched and I just don't like it lol but i'll definitely open up when I start getting comfy, only problem is sometimes I get dead silent and can't really start a conversation (i'm terrible at conversating ree)  \n\n\nWell I hope this gives you an idea of who I am and hope to see some people that are interested, hope to see you around hopefully!

The straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was that she asked if she could come over and make pizza and chill. So she gave a f*cking grocery list for HER toppings for HER pizza I though ok fine and it I did it. Then suddenly she cancels on me and she\u2019s rude about when I ask why she canceled \u201cI have my own life that doesn\u2019t revolve you\u201d she says and I lose it and flat out tell her that because she\u2019s been rude, I need a break from this friendship and I tell her that I\u2019m temporarily gonna block her on all social media and spend some time apart so that I don\u2019t say anything I might regret.

Flashback to a week ago I bought her food because she didn\u2019t have money, she promised to pay me back. I also gave her a custom Lana Del Rey popsocket that was kinda like a friendship bracelet. I text her after she texts me in the morning \u201cok, can you at least pay me my money and give me my popsocket back please, since you don\u2019t wanna be friends anymore\u201d she tells me \u201cno\u201d.

I don't even know what I like anymore. I am also having a hard time writing this as no words come to my head to describe this feeling I'm about to explain.\n\nMy friends like a game called \"Super Smash Bros Ultimate\". And I personally have no problem with it.But it was released last year on December, I don't know why, but I have become obsessed with the idea \"to have a variety of games.\" Like for example, they are STILL playing Smash Bros, and for some reason I treat games like Memes (internet jokes), i get bored quickly of them and pass on to the next. And I don't know why I have developed that mentality for games. A reason for it could be the way they treat Fortnite (another game that I like this time). They treat it like it's dead and no one's playing it. Like an anonymous user said in a comment of my posts: \"A game is dead when nobody plays it.\"  Since they treat Fortnite that way, I treat Smash Bros the same way (probably idk).\n\n\n I've also developed a weird mentality where my brain and self thinks everyone should like the same things. Example:\nMy friend, let's call him Aaron, constantly says phrases like \"I wanna go home\" or \"school sucks\" and I was offended by the last one because I really like school and I was/am offended. When I tell him my opinions, he always reacts the same way. \"You crazy man, school was made to suffer.\"\nI don't know who's wrong here, me or my friend. But that is what I want to find out, because I want to make myself a better person. \n\nNow if you made it all the way down here (please don't leave), I know what you're probably thinking. That everyone has the right to have the opinion they want to or like the game they want to. I know this, but my friends also need to respect that! Remember how I said I had the Memes-Games mentality on the Smash Bros? I probably have it because they treat my preferences the same way! And IDK if inside I'm offended or not, but I want to find out if I'm on a right side or not. If not, I want to find out and fix my mistakes. I know that I should respect everyone's opinion and I do, but my reactions are inevitable. I need tips, please.\n\n-MrP4nc4k35", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019ve always wanted to make long term friends but it\u2019s difficult as it takes time and a lot of effort. I\u2019ve made a post here before and reached out to several people but I didn\u2019t have much luck. Sometimes you don\u2019t click and that\u2019s totally okay. Right now I\u2019m talking to one person after a bit more than a month and hope to find more people to talk to. \n\nMy hobbies are : Playing the piano(working at Here with me &amp; Arcade from Duncan, listening to music (mostly Japanese/Korean artists), watching youtube vids mostly related to something Asian, gaming (PC paladins &amp; switch Zelda botw/lets go eevee), watching Anime(violet evergarden/parasyte/the world in colors) and right now fate/zero, Aviation, mindfulness, Mandarin language.\n\nSome more info about me what turned me into me today:\n\nWhen I was in elementary school my parents wanted me to follow Chinese lessons to keep my speaking and writing skills at a basic level. I wasn\u2019t really interested back then because it took the whole day away from me and I hated school. Fast forward to college and I realized after the first year I wanted to learn something which was not related to my major Mathematical engineering. I slowly began taking interest in the Mandarin language. In the first time in my life I was actually excited to follow lessons, I never had this weird feeling before but I looked forward to these classes. It didn\u2019t take long before I also began to watch more anime and things related to japan/korea. \n\nIn July I will be taking summer school in Taipei because I want to learn more about Mandarin and the culture in Taiwan. There is only a week and a half left before I have to book my flight and I\u2019m still not sure If I want to solo travel to another Asian country afterwards. It\u2019s not much more expensive If I travel to another Asian country from Taipei. I\u2019m less scared going to Taipei because there are other students who are also new to Taiwan and I haven\u2019t solo traveled before.\n\nMusic(&amp; the piano) is very important to me because it\u2019s one of the ways to express my emotions. There are a lot of different ways you can play a song and compose a song. Right now I\u2019m working at the song Arcade from Duncan Laurence on the piano. \n\nIf you decide to message then please mention your age! I don\u2019t care about what gender or anything you are! A friendship will take effort so if you only reply with a few words every time I\u2019ll automatically assume that you\u2019re not interested in me. I won\u2019t ghost but I will say this to you. You also don\u2019t have to reply immediately. Most of the time I will reply within a few hours but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to. I will appreciate it If you answer once a day though!

Who Reads Books", "author": "iamhereiguess", "self_text": "So I've tried this before, but never with a great deal of success. People often seem to like the idea of this more than the execution, but I am ever optimistic and trying again.\n\nWhat I am essentially proposing is a two-person virtual book club.\n\nI'm in two 'real-life' book clubs and love it, but as someone who reads at least a couple of books per week, it doesn't quite give me a chance to talk about everything I read with someone.\n\nI've tried online book clubs, but they seem to never work really well. People are always at different stages in the book, and conversation can spin away when it comes from that many directions, making it difficult to get more in depth than 'did you like the book?'\n\nSo I imagine that a smaller one-on-one sharing as we go would work a lot better. Now granted, this doesn't have to be all we talk about, I would still like to make a friend out of it ... but I figure it's at least a great place to start and would certainly always give us things to talk about.\n\nAs far as who I am ... I'm a 40-year-old married guy from Massachusetts. I know, much older than most on here, so just making sure it's out there and known.\n\nAs far as who you are ... someone who actually read all this, was able to make some sense of it, wants to read other things, and thinks it's a good idea. I don't think there need to be any guidelines beyond that. :)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Let's skip  the \"so what are you into\" messages, and get straight into the \"my boss  sucks\" messages. :)\n\nThe older I get,  the more I notice that the people I consider friends are drifting away.  People have families, kids, careers, etc.  All I want is someone who is  willing to share funny memes, or talk about their day, or listen to each  other when they need to complain. I\u2019m hoping that there\u2019s someone out  there that wants a casual text buddy or something.\n\nThe person I\u2019m looking for:\n\n* Not looking for a hookup or any sort of romantic relationship\n* Thinks memes are funny and has a favorite one\n* Is into things that make them happy and want to talk about those things\n* Any  age, but close to mine would be nice. At 31, it feels weird to talk to  anyone who is in their late teens or early twenties. I'm not picky  though\n* Male or female or whatever, I don\u2019t care tbh. I get along more with guys, but I\u2019m in desperate need of female friends too!\n\nThings you can expect me not to do/be:\n\n* Your therapist \u2013 sorry, but I have my own problems too, and I want us to be able to BOTH talk about what we have going on.\n* Your  long distance/internet girlfriend. I have a boyfriend. He\u2019s not going  anywhere. I\u2019m genuinely not interested in flirting with you \u2013 sorry!\n* Your  one-day-friend. I\u2019m honestly looking for someone for longer than one  conversation. Sure, if we don\u2019t click, let\u2019s part ways. But I\u2019m looking  for something longer than that. If you\u2019re not interested in that, I\u2019m  not your girl!\n* I\u2019m not into voice calls. Sorry, but it\u2019s just probably not going to happen.\n\nThings I WILL be:\n\n* Someone you can text during the work day to complain about your awful coworker/boss\n* Someone to share memes with and laugh at YouTube videos\n* Someone to maybe play games with on Steam? I kinda suck, but anything\u2019s possible\n* Someone who will genuinely give a shit about you\n\nThings that I\u2019m into, that would be cool if you were into, but no pressure:\n\n* Music  \u2013 I know that\u2019s general, but I love all aspects of music. Pop,  classical, country, you name it, I\u2019ll give it a shot. I\u2019m getting into  Kpop right now, so a recommendation would be nice! \n* Work  \u2013 I work a lot, and I love what I do. I do corporate training and  development, so if you\u2019re a teacher, we may have some stuff in common!\n* Crafty things \u2013 I cross stitch and I\u2019m trying to learn to crochet but I stink\n* TV/Movies  \u2013 I\u2019m open to anything. My favorite movie is any of the Lord of the  Rings movies. I also like to binge watch Netflix shows, so I\u2019d love  recommendations!\n* Other random tidbits you'll have to get to know me to find out!\n\nIf  you read this whole thing, you\u2019re awesome, and hit me up.

Thank you!* :) \n\n\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info (AKA full autobiography) about me:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate. In the process of joining CAF\u2019s reserves as, planning on Military Police role. \n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned careers, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics. At least, in regards to most topics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, although it had not surfaced for quite a while now; enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n- Chronically single, not that it is pertinent (After all, this is not r/r4r, ~~unless it is~~ - but *no* - I do not want your wiener and / or boob pictures, unless it is a wiener dog or you've a pair cuter than [these ones](https://galapagosconservation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Wildlife-BFB_1000x600.jpg)).\n\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am rather stigmatized against the latter by some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not, in fact, a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandise and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed.\nDespite that, I am in favor of marijuana's legalization so who knows \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\n- Gainfully *un*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work. Also trying to get a job as a security guard.\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Automata, WoW, Bioshock series, Prey, Metal Gear Solid, the &gt;Observer_, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. \nHonestly, for whatever reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nBeen playing some GTA V to kill time. It is alright. I like the pupper! Also about to start Sekiro, because I caved in and bought a disc. Pretty pumped!\n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favourite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \nAlso just re-started Futurama after finishing season 7. Woo.\n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favourite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loathe cheap jumpscares they are so enamoured with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n\n- My sense of humour is possibly the worst, and I take pride in having offensive memes for every occasion ready. Needless to say, I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile stuff. \n\n- My main hobby right now is Airsoft. I spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together since I ordered most of my gear from companies in Russia, not wanting to settle for cheaper subsitutes. At least the quality is as good as it gets!  \nThe centrepiece of my collection is my plate carrier which came with full kevlar inserts and is of the model that is only issued to specific units of Russia's FSB. \n\nHad a game this weekend, and it was a riot. I dropped my pistol in the mud, my red dot died right before the game and I was reduced to using iron sights (I hate iron sights), but it was fantastic. \n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I suck at categorizing music that I like, and listen to most genres, so it is simpler to say what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord).\nSeriously though, I am big on modern and older metal, rock, punk, indie-esque stuff, EDM and so on. \n\n I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n\nSome of my favourite bands are Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Muse, Green Day, Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, NIN and many, many more - if it is not obvious by this point, I am so edgy that I (used to) cut myself :D\n\n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%, due to a certain affinity for slithering neck-ties and positive human qualities like ambition, narcissism and general douchebaggery. But hey, at least I am honest (?) :D \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. Stuf like lack o punctuatuion impropar gramar to short n generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit. \n\nAgain, rephrasing the last part for dozens of people who simply don't get it: *you now know a certain amount about myself. After reading your message, I should be able to know a certain amount about you - not asking for something as in depth as here, but the \"Hello my name is X I am from Y and I like Z\" is not good enough.*\n\nAlso, here are some pictures of [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0), because why not? \n\n *Please, PMs only*! I loath Reddit Chat UI. I would prefer to talk here for the first while as compared to going over to certain apps whose names trigger bots..\nThe odds are, if you ignore this, I will either not see your Chat or don\u2019t reply on principle :3 \n... If you did not understand it, I am on the picky side.\n\nFeel free to hit me with your favourite ice breaker / shower question!

I\u2019d love to keep meeting new people like I have been, this subreddit has genuinely never worked once for me, but hey maybe that\u2019ll change! I\u2019m going to break it down into categories, if nothing appeals to you, you don\u2019t have to message me, but you still can if you want. I doubt I will get many replies because you know, I\u2019m a Male lmao. But anyways... \n\nMUSIC: I love music, like a lot, I\u2019d love to find someone to talk to about it, I can\u2019t make it, I just listen to it, it\u2019s my dream to make it, but I doubt i will, if you\u2019d like to know what I listen to, here\u2019s a playlist I made, https://open.spotify.com/user/bowerham67/playlist/65G0kKoxo4YbaR3H8RZScI?si=qJv8xr-dSq2PwtNwr47ODQ there are a lot more bands I love, just a few examples are: the 1975, the Slaves, super organism, oasis and more, but I didn\u2019t think they fit into the playlist that well, I wanted something that flows well, take a listen to it if you want! There\u2019s a lot of Damon Albarn stuff, as he\u2019s my favourite musician ever, so bonus points if you like anything like gorillaz or blur haha. \n\nGAMES: to be honest, I don\u2019t play a lot of games! I play PC and Nintendo switch, pc I only play things like black ops 3 modded zombies, VR CHAT and any other free thing lmao, but on Nintendo switch I play a lot more, I used to be super into dragon ball XV2 but I lost my save and basically lost everything, it pretty much unmotivated me and I can\u2019t get into like I was in the past now, I really fuckin loved that game though, usually you\u2019ll catch me playing either smash bros or Narultimate ninja storm 3, it\u2019s funny because I don\u2019t really like anime,  I\u2019m just a SUCKER for dragon ball and naruto, (like seriously, **if you like naruto SHIPPUDEN as much as I do, we are going to get along** )i also have: doom, crash bandicoot, splatoon 2, breath of the wild, rocket league, minecraft, and there\u2019s probably one that\u2019s escaping my brain right Now, wow, for someone who doesn\u2019t play games much I did go on... \n\nCLOTHING/STREETWEAR: so, I\u2019m going to be honest, I don\u2019t have any sense of fashion, like, AT ALL, I usually will wear, some band t shirt, cheap tracksuit pants, and a pair of yeezys, like it really doesn\u2019t go well together, before you ask, I wouldn\u2019t call myself a hype beast, I just genuinely love the YEEZY line, the clothing, the shoes, everything, I\u2019m a big fan of Kanye in general, but I\u2019ve just been trying to understand clothing and I\u2019d love someone to help with with it lmao, I\u2019m very excited for the new Yeezy black 350s and I\u2019d love to share this excitement with someone haha, I\u2019m not sure what my style is, actually I\u2019m not too sure what that even means, I\u2019d just like to start looking better when I go out. \n\n\nVOICE CHAT: not too sure what to say about this bit! Just, I like to voice chat, I personally feel like, you can\u2019t really be genuine friends with someone until you talk on voice, maybe I\u2019m alone on that thought, but I feel like it really humanises the person to you, also I know a lot people like British accents, so maybe I can help with that haha. If you don\u2019t want to voice chat, that\u2019s fine. \n\nCONCERTS: I\u2019m aware this is a bit of a yikesy thing to say, I don\u2019t know anyone on here of course, but I\u2019ll say it anyway, going to concerts is a BIG hobby of mine, this year I\u2019m hoping to go to a lot, I\u2019ll list them all, \nKero Kero bonito, all points east festival, the good, the bad, and the queen, reading festival (Friday only probably) Liam Gallagher,and the happy Monday\u2019s, there\u2019s lots more I\u2019d like to go see, my dream is to see Kanye, but I doubt he\u2019ll ever play the UK so that\u2019s that lmao, but yeah, if you\u2019re interested In that do tell me, I really do want to go to reading festival, but If there\u2019s one thing I know it\u2019s that going to a concert alone is the WORST, trust me, I\u2019m hoping to see the 1975 there, joji would be quite good too, the chats, pale waves, I\u2019d also really like to go on Saturday too, but it all depends if resale prices are insanely high. \n\nCONCLUSION: Im very sorry, I\u2019ve now only just realised how long I spend writing this, I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ve never really written much about myself, when people ask I just say \u201coh, I\u2019m quite boring\u201d and that usually isn\u2019t a very good introduction is it? So I thought I\u2019d go all out for once, if you are interested in me as a person through this, do message me, I usually don\u2019t mind people just saying \u201chey\u201d, but I have found most interactions that way haven\u2019t lead to much, so I\u2019ll ask for this, just tell me your age, gender, and what about my post interested you, and then tell me a bit about yourself if you want, not to sound narcissistic, but I\u2019m overly polite, I\u2019m one of those people where if you hit me I\u2019d say sorry for getting in your way, so if you say hey I\u2019ll probably still reply, but please do introduce yourself, final thing is, Age limit, please be around 10 years of my age, that\u2019s all, thanks everyone, I hope someone does come through :) \n\nI talk on discord mainly, but I do have pretty much everything", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

My name (cookieXL) is just a name I picked when I was young for when I made my first accounts on games and some sites, it has no particular meaning. Some of my favorite anime's are: 'Made in Abyss, Konosuba, That Time I Got Reincarnated As a Slime and all of that Idol stuff'. I have a pretty big game library so I play a lot of games randomly, I mainly play Overwatch and Osu! (Mania). I like many types of music, most of the time I listen to Lo-Fi beats or Future Bass. I also collect anime related merchandise (Figures, Wall-Scrolls, etc..), I also read manga, most of the manga I read is online since it's easier to acces.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Occasional sarcasm is okay as long as it's somewhat obvious.\n\nI'm just looking for a friend. Maybe someone I could cuddle with (through roleplays and stuff, of course). I'd prefer someone kind and affectionate, who won't ghost me, and who will tell me when I've made them uncomfortable, without being mean about it. In addition to my autism, I have anxiety and PTSD, and I recently got out of a bad living situation with my verbally and emotionally abusive stepmother. Overall, I just would like someone I know I can trust, talk to, and care for, and someone who can do the same for me.\n\nDM for my Discord username; I will talk primarily on Discord.\n\n(If you're transphobic, please don't message me at all.

I created a new account because some of my friends who use Reddit follow my main account, and I just don't want them to know this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have three siblings, all older. One brother and two sisters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of my sisters told me she broke up with her boyfriends after a 5-year long relationship while being on a trip through South America. She met someone while traveling and now she won't come back home. She said she loves him and she loves her and now she's going to Peru with him. And the worst thing is I am the only one together with my mom who knows this and every time anyone asks: \"Oh I wonder what she is doing all that time\" or \"Oh what does she want to do in Peru again?\" (She already visited on her stay).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months ago I found out that my mom is cheating on my dad. It's been eating me up since then but now it's really f\\*cking with me. Sometimes when I get home early I kind of \"surprise\" them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI build up a friendship with a 12-year-old boy from Sweden and he told me he was depressed when I met him. He said stuff like he want to kill himself because he is always unlucky in life but I always cheered him up. Now I'm thinking he just said that to make me spend time with him. I literally am just a straight up nice person so I wanted to comfort him at first but by now he really grew close to my heart. I just feel like I'm his older brother. And he just told me about something really stupid he plans on doing what probably was the straw that broke the camel's back. He said he really likes a girl, she has to move somewhere else with a foster family because she smokes and stuff and he wants to help her \"escape\" (?) or basically run away. I tried talking him out of it but he is really committed to it. He got a plan to hide her in a summer house his family owns but I told him several times even if they manage to get there it won't work out for long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm just sick of being everyone's secret keeper even though I don't want to keep their shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do. I'm lost I think about just giving up on all of them.\n\nOne thing that makes me keep contact with my friend from Sweden is that I just really do care a lot about him.
