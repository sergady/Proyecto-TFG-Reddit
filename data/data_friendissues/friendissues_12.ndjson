I knew since a very young age that I liked guys (pretty much had a crush on a guy in preschool) but kept it a secret since in my home town gay people are shunned from society. \nI don\u2019t care what people have to say about gay people, I mean everyone is entitled to have their own opinion right? But since he was my best friend in the world everything he said really hurt. I tried to be tolerant because of our friendship but everything took a turn when another guy in my class came out as bisexual (he was kinda close to my friend circle). My best friend started to talk sh*t about him to me and we would often laugh at everything he did. \nNeedles to say I felt terrible since it was pretty obvious that we were making fun of him but I couldn\u2019t defend him either or my bestie would know that I was also gay (maybe not so but I didn\u2019t wanted to take any risks at that time).\n\nAfter a while I just couldn\u2019t handle more of the homophobic remarks and decided that I had to end our friendship. \nBut at that point I couldn\u2019t just stop talking to him randomly I had to have an excuse so I came up with this plan to make something up and make us fight to finish off our friendship. I knew it would hurt both of us so I decided to also stop talking to everyone on our circle of friends so that he ended up with all of our friends and they could console him at least (I just didn\u2019t wanted to make our friends feel like they had to pick a side). It ended up not working, he came begging for me to forgive him and take him back haha and I just couldn\u2019t do that to him he was still my best friend and I couldn\u2019t bare to see him like that. \nHe continued being a homophobic *sshole and I continued to start fights over nothing, essentially toxifying our friendship. Finally we had a pretty bad fight over the most ridiculous thing and I took the opportunity to end things...\nWe literally stopped talking for 4 months (mind you we where in the same class together). It became a pretty big deal, we were known for being inseparable and now we didn\u2019t even glance at each other. The teachers and classmates got involved and tried to talk to us individually but I knew I couldnt go back to that friendship it just hurt so bad... \nI felt miserable knowing that I was hurting him and even worse because I couldn\u2019t even tell him why I was doing everything. At least knowing that he had all our friends supporting him gave me some peace but one day he came up to me and ask to me if we could talk in private (took me completely off guard we hadn\u2019t spoken in months). He tried to mend things up and then just started bawling. I couldn\u2019t do that to him anymore, I had to take him back so I did. It felt rea having him back but at the same time I wonder \u201cso was this all for nothing?\u201d. \nHe was still very homophobic and eventually we went to college and drifted apart. \nIt has been 2 years since we last spoke and I still miss him. I never meant to hurt him but I just couldn\u2019t see any other way out...\nSo now I ask you, what would have you done in my place? \n\nTLDR, I was gay, had an homophobic best friend and had to end our friendship", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I didn\u2019t like her anyways because she was always mean to me and now that she was gone we were even closer.

Then eventually they started hanging out with the kids from the track group (which I\u2019m not a part of). I felt really isolated.

Was super weird for me to continue to hang out with them since we weren't together anymore and he was the one that introduced me to them all. Plus I didn't benefit much from them except for fun times going out drinking and going to festivals with them.\n\nNow, I mainly hang out with my close friends 1 on 1 since they're all pretty different from each other and have different interests and stuff. It kinda sucks because say if I were to host an event (e.g birthday) I struggle to know who to invite because it would be a weird af mix, like I could not picture them all together.\n\nI think there are pros and cons to having a friend group vs individual friends that you just vibe with 1 on 1.\n\nImho, pros of friend group:\n\nyou all kinda merge same interests, slang, inside jokes, you always have a group to do stuff with (more the merrier right) and you overall just feel like you have a secure identity when you have a group.\n\ncons of friend group:\n\nbitching? + you're not SUPER close with each one of them vs having one best friend and there might be someone you don't really like but have to hang out with\n\npros of individual friends:\n\nrealest closest friends that truly care for you, can dnm the fuck out with all of them, they're all different from each other so its always a different vibe hanging out with one of them vs the other and learn more stuff have a taste from each one of them so ya more variety\n\ncons of individual friends:\n\nlooks like you have no friends lol, can't really invite them all together because the vibe would be weird af, don't have a solid group for group events like festivals and sheit\n\nSO do you guys have/prefer a group of friends or different indivual friends that you see 1 on 1?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

This December my boyfriend and I make 1 year. For a little bit of background info, I\u2019m in my 4th year of college and I\u2019ve been friends with 3 other girls for nearly a decade. Since I got into a relationship, my best friends have been slowly becoming more distant. I went from going to 2-3 sleepovers at someone\u2019s house every week to not being invited at all\u2014 even to things outside of sleepovers. My friends have disclosed that they absolutely hated my boyfriends guts even though they\u2019ve never spent time around him. When I tried to get them to hang out with him and me at a festival, they refused and all the sudden told me they planned on having a \u201cgirls day.\u201d We tried resolving the conflict and I apologized for over stepping boundaries, however, I never received an apology for the harsh words they used against me when I told them that they really hurt my feelings. That day my boyfriend saw me breakdown complexly for the first time. Words cannot explain how broken I felt after asking one of my friends in particular to try and understand how hurtful they were. Eventually I brushed it off and they were still distant. \n\nI understand that they might be upset that I don\u2019t spend as much time with them anymore because of my relationship + school + my job. I truly never feel wanted though. At this point if I talked to them about how I feel rejected from the group, I feel as if they\u2019d place the blame on me and pretend they\u2019re willing to work on our friendship, but still would talk shit about me behind my back when they hang out with out me. \n\nFast forward to more recently, it was one of our friends birthdays and she lives a couple hours away now. So me and my 2 other friends all drove to her house to go to her party and they were going to be my ride back home the next day. I was unaware that they made plans to go to a $70 haunted house the next day (i thought we\u2019d just spend the next morning hungover and drive home in our pjs when we felt like it) until they told me half way through the night. They said \u201cyou\u2019re invited, but we know it\u2019s expensive so we figured you wouldn\u2019t wanna go.\u201d I was completely unprepared: i didn\u2019t pack clothes or makeup to go, and i didn\u2019t have enough money to spend $70 on a haunted house. So i panicked and had to desperately ask other people i knew at the party if they\u2019d be okay bringing me home. It was a really shitty feeling that they kept a major detail out of our weekend plans and almost left me stranded 2 hours away from home.\n\nEver since then, I\u2019ve barely spoken a word to them and our group message is dead (they have one w/o me).I feel so hopeless and that they wouldn\u2019t see anything wrong. Did I do something wrong to deserve this behavior? Did my friends become toxic to me? Should I confront them about this situation even though it\u2019s been a month? It\u2019s been eating away at me  since and i\u2019ve been having bad dreams where they\u2019re ignoring me/being extremely rude to me. \nIf you read to the end bless your heart, and PLEASE i\u2019m begging for advice.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm not the one calling YOU when you tell me the timing is bad. That's understandable. But YOU called ME.\n\nSo then they will preface the conversation by saying \"I wanna hear all about what's going on with you but only have a couple of minutes (in other words talk fast). This always makes me roll my eyes and think what is your problem???? \n\nRecently I just got another call like this. First they called and I answered the phone and as soon as I answered said oh hey actually I need.to call you right back. I said fine. Then they did. As we were talking they said what's all that noise in the background??? I can barely hear you. I said oh I'm in a store. In my opinion it was not really loud at all but my friend seemed so irritated by this fact. So I tried to be courteous and stepped outside where t would be more quiet. My friend then reminded me they only had a couple minutes to talk but would call me again later. Again I thought are you calling to tell me something important or tine sensitive??? If not then why not simply call when you actually have time rather than make ME feel like I'm inconveniencing you when you're the one who called to speak to me???\n\nSo we spoke for just a minute or so and I was told she had to go but would call me back becusse she has a 30 minute drive to an event she's going to (apparently needing someone to keep her company as she drove). I hate when people do or tell me this. Call me sensitive but it makes me feel used. Cal me when you wanna talk not when you need to kill time. \n\nI was in transit myself and although she was navigating when she was free for this call she did not bother to ask if I could talk or if or when I could talk she instead was just telling ME when I should be available for her call. As it turned out I was getting on a train to head back home so the timing was not great for me but I figured I'd grab the call if I could. When I arrived back home I texted to say I'm home now if she can talk now. She tells me shes now at her event so we can talk after. \n\nSorry for long boring sttory. Point is I cannot stand when someone who seemingly is trying to reach ME acts like its super inconvenient for them . Now I'm in the position of having to chase them down. This happens all the time with this person. Yes I have said stuff to her but it does not sink in.  I cannot even imagine having the balls to call someone to say hey I'm calling to let you know I don't have time to talk and am very busy. Why did this at all???? So ridiculous.

I'm (35M) in search of someone (preferably another man) who is interested in a deeper friendship. When I say \"deeper,\" I mean someone who is looking for contact more often than every 3 weeks, or just a casual acquaintance. My life can get pretty busy at times, as happens with most people, but I still would like a friend that wants to stay in touch. I would love to meet someone who is down-to-earth and an introvert. As a friend, I tend to like to ask questions and really get to know a person. I try to be supportive and open-minded.\n\nAbout Me:\n\nI'm happily married and work in physics education, but am trying to break into some kind of computer science/programming field (probably web development). Coding/programming is my favorite hobby, along with building spaceship models...did I mention I'm a total nerd?\n\nI really like science fiction, and am totally obsessed with Star Trek. My favorite book series is Dune, although I only really like the first 3 books. I tried to read the 4th one, and I was pretty much totally lost the whole time (maybe it was too smart for me?). I love playing video games to unwind.\n\nI'm pretty liberal and agnostic, but I don't try to impose my beliefs/ideologies on others. I probably wouldn't get along with someone who (whom? sorry, really bad at grammar) is on the total opposite spectrum as me in terms of politics. I'm not really spiritual, but don't mind if someone is (my wife is very spiritual).\n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n\nSomeone who is open-minded, loves to learn, humble, and is a good listener. Someone who is actually interested in getting to know me, as well as me getting to know them. I think I have a pretty good sense of humor, and would love someone to laugh with. \n\nIf any of this resonates with you, feel free to send me a message.\n\nThanks!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I felt really bad for him, and thought he could use a friend.\n\nBut then, I developed feelings for him without warning - it just happened one time we were talking. Fast forward to June, and I found out he liked my best friend (like, that fact came out of nowhere), and admittedly, I was broken apart by it.\n\nI realised a lot of things about myself, because it made me realise that (unlike my best friend that he liked) I barely had any self-confidence and was very much a complainer. So, I took time away from everyone (bar my family) in my social life (including him) to figure myself out up until the summer. I came back to school, and tried to incorporate this new me into my social life.\n\nHowever, I realised, that I still had feelings for this guy, and it was really preventing me from focusing on things that matter, like my family, other friends and studying - the majority of my time was taken up by thoughts and fantasy\u2019s about him. That\u2019s when I knew I should stop talking to him. Not to mention he said things to me that made me confused on where he stood In our friendship (like he would make pretty flirtatious suggestions and statements to me).\n\nMy only problem was is that, during my time with him before he told me that he liked my best friend, we became best friends really quick. Like we told each other personal stuff that we told nobody else for example. And honestly, I\u2019ve always wanted a best friend like that, but never had the courage to get one - we get each other.\n\nThen, in October, I finally told him that we needed to separate for a while because, I\u2019m not going to lie, I was going through a really bad time from September - October, and these feelings on top of everything, made me really ill. It got so bad that, when my best friend told me he got a girlfriend, I felt like I was going to vomit, and I genuinely hated myself for it because I felt like I was being a really shitty friend for not being happy for him and being selfish. \n\nHe understood, but I could tell he felt guilty and ashamed of it all. We parted ways, but then that night, he sent me a text saying that he hopes to still retain the friendship in the future and hopes I get better soon. We haven\u2019t spoken since\n\nThe first few weeks after this were hell for me - I was breaking down, not eating and vomiting, but I don\u2019t know whether that was because I lost my best friend, or the unrequited love was getting to me. I\u2019m not thinking about him 24/7, but I do think about him at least once a day... I now really miss him. But, I\u2019m really conflicted with where I should stand with whole situation. Should I reconnect when I\u2019m in a better state of mind, or should I stay clear of him because of how crazy my feelings drive me?\n\nTL:DR - can\u2019t figure out if I should reconnect with my best friend because how my physical reactions make me feel", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I have a friend who has gotten popular in the music world. He often has over 1million monthly listeners on spotify and has hit 2.5 mil monthly in the last year. His biggest album is one of my images that he and I collabed on 4yrs ago back in college. He sent me an image to crop him out of and use. Then I created a whole new image using a photo I shot, that I photoshopped him into and stylized. At the time, he was popular but not this popular. We never discussed payment and at the time I thought it was cool he was using it. Never explicitly said \"it is yours,\" just sent him the image I made.  \n\nWe're now roommates. He tours and makes music for a living, I'm a full time web dev so very different daily lifestyles. Before this job, I was helping him on the side with graphics/videos and was a tour manager for a few small US tours. For the graphics/videos, he gave $400 per month. It was give or take 20hrs of work a month, so okay. Also for 3 shows I think I made $3000. That was 4 all-day work days. \n\nOn tour I helped sell merch since we were a team of 2. We did over $700 of album sales each night. The album that my cover is on selling the best (the music on it is the most liked by fans). I shot another cover for his newest album but since he was giving me $400 a month to be on retainer at the time, I think he owns it. The other artwork I did 4yrs ago which is best selling one, I think I still own the image. He just re-released this album and is selling this one again with my art. I feel like I'm entitled to some profit sharing or a sum fee. Also my name isn't on the album anywhere, so no real credit either. This may lean towards a music business question but lmk if you think there is room for discussion or if I just need to move on... I could see how a talk like this would put some serious damage onto a friendship and it is his music that is selling, my art is just an accompaniment. \n\nSide note, he has taken a few of my personal video clips and used them on his ig and used a still from a short I made with him and another friend (they acted) for fun as a single cover - all of which was unasked.

Unbeknownst to me, she had doubts about our friendship, and grudges she had been holding. I still thought of her as my best friend and one of the few reasons I never felt lonely in the world. One day I reached out to her for advice and she responded with all these doubts and feelings about our friendship, stating she\u2019s unsure if we can still be friends. I was heartbroken and shocked. It all came out of no where. Things were never the same after that. We attempted to talk things out and remain friends, but we both changed so much. We have different interests and hobbies. The last year and half was really tough for me and I dealt with a lot of my past demons for the first time and she was mostly unavailable during the time. She always seems to be \u201cbusy\u201d yet I knows she makes time for other people. Ever since I got engaged, she\u2019s been dropping hints to know if she\u2019s a bridemaid. She even mistakenly texted me \u201cI\u2019m so excited to be your bridesmaid\u201d to which I responded, I haven\u2019t asked people yet. She has also been texting me recently with small talk, which feels weird bc she hasn\u2019t done that in many years. It makes me a little annoyed bc I feel like she\u2019s only doing it bc she wants to be a bridesmaid so badly. She\u2019s only met my fianc\u00e9 twice  in the 3+ years we\u2019ve been dating. I feel like she\u2019s been MIA for all the important things happening in my life(my bdays, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s bdays, house warmings) but how she wants to be involved because she wants to be a bridesmaid. Am I wrong for not wanting her to be a BM? She will likely not be friends with me and not come to the wedding if she\u2019s not a BM, and I\u2019m okay with that but I do feel bad that she will feel hurt. I also know it looks bad to the group of ppl who have known us to be BFFs for so many years and it looks bad on me to not have her as a BM when they don\u2019t know the details (and I don\u2019t plan on airing our laundry).

Considering I'm posting on r/Needafriend, I'm looking for some new friends. Had met some nice people on here before but things didn't quite pan out the way I hoped. However! Mama didn't raise no quitters so I'm back on the saddle, looking to make new friends. First things first, a bit about myself, since no good relationship of any kind starts without knowing a bit about me to paint a picture.\n\n**About Me**\n\nI'm an 19 year old living in Australia. Outside of studying IT at university, my interests and hobbies are primarily around gaming and anime. I feel like I have a pretty sound knowledge of games and anime of all kinds, and love talking to people about it. I'm currently playing Rainbow Six Siege, Ace Combat 7, and Death Stranding on PS4. I would  consider My Hero Academia and RWBY to be my all-time favorite anime (RWBY is an anime and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise). Video games aren't the only types of games I play. I play a lot of boardgames and tabletop games. I am living for D&amp;D right now, I love playing social deduction games (Like Mafia, Town of Salem, Werewolves, Two Room and a Boom), and other board games like Love Letter and Unstable Unicorn, as well as party games like the Jackbox Packs. In summary, I'm a massive nerd and weeb, and I'm proud.\n\nMore recently I've also started developing an interest in cosplay, voice acting, and digital art. I'm certainly no professional  cosplayer or voice actor, nor do I have the artistic talent of Leonardo da Vinci, but I'm certainly trying to improve myself while learning  more about each craft and having fun in the process.\n\nOn top of that, I do have an interest in exercising and being healthy.  At times I struggle to find time or motivation to exercise and keep a  routine, but maybe I just need to find a gym buddy to hit the gyms with.  Perhaps you could help me out with that? \n\n I would like to think of myself as very open-minded and accepting of a  lot of things, and I'm happy with meeting new people and trying out a lot of new things. After all, I see every new opportunity as a learning experience, and this is no exception. \n\n**What I'm Looking For**\n\nIf you're living in Australia, and around my age (17 - 22) that would be a huge plus. I'm of the belief that its easier to form a genuine connection to someone who is close to you in age and location. However I am flexible and more than happy to chat if you're a little older or if you're from a different country. \n\nI would like to try talking to other girls, and build up my confidence further, although I'm not opposed to meeting more dudes. Having at least one similar interest would also help a lot. I want someone I can meme around with, while also occasionally not being afraid to get into some deep conversations about stuff that;s on our mind. I'm also just looking for people who put in effort to make friendships work, and for people who want to meet me half way. Not being ghosted is a huge plus too. Above all else, I just want there to be clear communication between the two of us. I place communication in high regard.\n\nAlright, if you've made it to the end of this post, congrats! Hopefully I piqued your interest. If I did, shoot me a **message**, **do not** send me a chat. In your message, tell me about yourself, and write a response to the following question so I know you've read through the post: \"If you are left leaning, what is your most right leaning political view. Conversely if you are right leaning, what is your most left leaning political view.\"\n\nI hope to hear from you soon!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

She also stated that she felt alone because she was showing her whole face and her friend wasn\u2019t.\n\nSo then after that they continued to talk and Emily wasn\u2019t seeming to understand. I was agreeing with Cheyenne and I said it was hypocritical and then she got defensive.\nSo then Emily said \u201cthis is exactly why I don\u2019t have girl friends\u201d and she said just to \u201cget over it\u201d and she said \u201cthis is so little why are you even starting this\u201d but it\u2019s like we\u2019re able to express however we feel.

We\u2019ve been friends for about 7 years. I feel myself distancing from her because she tends to be very overwhelming. Before I get into examples, I just wanted to point out that a coworker pointed this out to me. She said the way my best friend treats me isn\u2019t so great. and NOW, I can\u2019t stop noticing every single thing she does and I\u2019m scared that at some point, I\u2019m going to blow up at her and look like the bad guy. \n\nFirst off, she makes comments regarding the way I choose to dress. One time on the phone, she said that I\u2019m very put together and would prefer if I was more casual, wore no make-up and sweats. Personally, I haven\u2019t reached that point where I\u2019m confident with my skin. I kindly told her that it\u2019s my decision whether or not I wear make up and I can wear whatever I want. She got defensive and said that wasn\u2019t what she meant, she said she admired the fact that I had the time to do it. Mind you, I take like an hour to get ready at most.\n\nOne time, we were getting a ride from my parents very late at night from the airport. I had an emergency and had to make stop to the hospital. I had a really rough experience and she stayed with me and my parents the entire night. After everything happened, she made a point that almost made me feel guilty. She looked at me and said \u201cwow, you have to admit, I\u2019m such a good friend for staying with you all night\u201d and laughed it off, like she did something so outrageous? I would expect any friend to do that. \n\nI started to notice her behaviour bother me more and more. They were small comments that could really get under someone\u2019s skin. \n\nBut here\u2019s the part that really got me - I also feel like she\u2019s in constant competition with me when it comes to guys. I was talking to this guy and she looked over at who I was talking to and told me that he was trying to talk to her at the club a month ago but that she ditched him for someone else... that was it. Based on this one single experience, she told me to stay away from him because he\u2019s a \u201cfuckboy\u201d. I personally didn\u2019t really care that he hit on my friend in the past, especially if she doesn\u2019t even know him. I wanted to give him a chance because he was actually a genuinely nice guy. She brought up the story of them talking that one time at a club, countless amount of times. \n\nI noticed after she found out about us texting, she followed him on IG. She wasn\u2019t a mutual follower when I was on his profile before, so it was right after she found out about us. I don\u2019t care if she follows his social media, I\u2019m more concerned about her motives or intentions that come with her actions. The last time she told me the story of them talking once, she mentioned that she may have kissed him but she wasn\u2019t sure. One time, that guy and I were talking at a bar and she came up and was discreetly telling me to stay away from him, that he\u2019s a fuckboy, whatever. Me and the guy left the club to get food and she was sending me texts telling me the same thing. To stay away. I got really fed up and never brought him up around her anymore.\n\nI really liked this guy, he showed me no red flags, and I chose to stay away from him because she told me it was a bad idea.

For essentially my whole entire middle school career, I never left my home to go to a friends house nor had anyone come over to mine to hang out. \n\nThen, in 9th grade, everything got mixed up. The way the district works is that there were 2 middle schools, and one building for 9th graders, before they went to the high school. There, I met a lot of new people that were cool and talked with me. But throughout the year it became clear that these people were just, superficial and like everyone else. But there was this one kid, we\u2019ll call him Pat, who I was too scared to talk to but really wanted to talk to. He was really cool, talked to a lot of people that I talked to and never really gave off any hostile vibes or ones of disdain towards me. I spent 10th grade the same way, too scared to really talk but I did try a couple times but never really got anywhere. \n\nThen junior year hit. A lot of shit happened between the the end of 10th grade and the beginning of 11th grade... for one I actually somewhat settled into a friend group that Pat was close with. We dicked around on the computer, played Terraria or CS:GO or Minecraft, even Borderlands. Slowly, I talked to Pat more and more. The more I talked with him the more that I really enjoyed him. He wasn\u2019t like the other people in the group, he was super intelligent and actually didn\u2019t devolve into calling me slurs (because I\u2019m gay) and he always sorta protected me from them. A year passes, the friend group dissolved. The other person in the group I was close with turned on me, started spewing out my personal shit and my personal problems and trying to blackmail me. I contacted the police, his parents, and school administration and it no longer was an issue (and yes the police were necessary because he threatened to come to my house and rob me/shoot my family). \n\nBut Pat and I slowly became closer and closer. But through the whole time we\u2019d only ever hung out once, which was to go get dinner. The other times we interacted outside of school and not on the computer was with the rest of the group. Slowly we became closer, and I actually got him laid. That\u2019s a story by itself and it\u2019s waaaay too long, but the gist is that this one girl hit me up and said she had a crush on him and he had one on her and I just pushed them together. \n\nEverything may seem ok, right? Well here\u2019s the thing, I do have many social issues, along with mental health issues, because of my younger years. He has always been so patient with me and although he didn\u2019t understand, he was there for me and offered his advice. He helped me through so much, he even talked me out of taking my own life. \n\nHere\u2019s issue #1: he says he\u2019s always busy. Now don\u2019t get me wrong he is, he\u2019s got baseball, soccer, and football along with a bunch of AP classes to worry about, but he takes forever to respond. Issue being that in school I always see him on his phone and whenever my ex-friend would text him or Snapchat him, he\u2019d always respond quickly. \n\nIssue #2: he has, as a consequence of all those sports that he had been a part of for so long, many other friends that he was closer with\n\nI understand that people won\u2019t always respond quickly, and I understand that I\u2019ve only talked to him for ~1.5 years, but my ex friend only talked to him for about 2 years but had such a more meaningful relationship. \n\nAt this point in my life, he, and one other girl, are the only people I really talk to and consider my best friends. I\u2019ve brought up these things before with him, and some things have changed, but not anything in a really meaningful way to make a difference of make it seem like he understands/cares. I\u2019m always free to do anything, like my free time is from after school till I go to sleep because no one else ever makes plans with me or wants to do anything. He always says he\u2019ll let me know, but then dosent say anything and essentially ghosts me and it really messes with me. For example, we made plans a week before to go out for lunch, and I actually got him on board and he said yeah let\u2019s do it, but then Saturday rolls around and I go out to the place and wait and he never shows. I call him and he doesn\u2019t respond, and I sent a couple texts and nothing. 7 hours later, after I get off of work, he texts me and says, \u201cwait oops mb\u201d. That\u2019s it, dosent explain himself or anything. I felt like an absolute clown for waiting for him and for thinking that I would finally catch a break. \n\nNow this cause some issues in my head, as it really made my social anxiety flare and my depression and nihilistic thoughts to spike. This also strikes me as off because he\u2019s always going out with other people, even last minute plans. My ex friend, once again, made a last minute plan with me in the car to go get food and he called him and he said sure. I witnessed this happen multiple times, and I know it\u2019s happened more because of other people telling me about parties and whatnot. \n\nHere\u2019s my question: what do I do? How do I go about resolving this issue with him? Do I give up trying to be friends with him? Do I just accept it? I\u2019m honestly at a loss and any suggestions would be so helpful, thank you so much.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Also I did this on my phone so sorry for errors.\n\nI\u2019ve been friends with this girl for about 3 years - let\u2019s call her Vaseline (fucking christ). Before I met Vaseline, she had a best friend who disappeared off the planet (I\u2019m not fucking joking we haven\u2019t seen her for months) and they were very close. Until shit happened and she didn\u2019t like her that much anymore. Then I became her best friend. It was fun - we\u2019d joke about stuff, went to town together and stuff. When we got to secondary school, I made a new friend who we will call Carmex (i\u2019m very creative with names). We became good friends and soon she was in our little circle. \n\nFlash forward two years now I feel left out. When Vaseline would come over, we\u2019d be waiting for the next track on Mario Kart and she\u2019d be laughing at her phone. I\u2019d ask and she\u2019d respond saying it was Carmex. I didn\u2019t think of it as much until the last term when Vaseline told me she liked Carmex. I had no problem with that and supported her. The two grew close together and over the summer they started to date. That\u2019s when it all felt off. They would hang out without me (it would be on Vaseline\u2019s instagram story) and I felt lost - I didn\u2019t ask why I wasn\u2019t invited to anything but I didn\u2019t care really.\n\nThen school started back up. Sometimes Carmex would be pissed off and would go off so I\u2019d have to look after Vaseline and say they did nothing wrong. Then they\u2019d both be upset but by lunch everything was alright except I wasn\u2019t. I felt like I was third-wheeling. If I showed Vaseline something on my phone, she wouldn\u2019t even look but just go straight back to her conversation. I felt really awkward. \n\nThen we get to today at lunch. Carmex went to the bathroom and Vaseline went with her. Then, I didn\u2019t see them for the whole lunch. I felt like I was being left out, again. There are other people who hang out in the same place as us but I\u2019m not that close to them as I am to Vaseline and Carmex. I don\u2019t want to leave and be seen as an asshole but I don\u2019t want to feel left out anymore except that I don\u2019t know what to say as there has been incidents in the past with what I say even thought when they say something nothing happens. \n\nCarmex and Vaseline have started to ignore my texts - they get read but no responses (even when they\u2019re not together). I probably sound like an asshole but it would be nice to have a message back so I don\u2019t feel completely ignored. I\u2019ve also been ignored in school and other shit. \n\nThey joke about how my voice goes high when I\u2019m mad, how I pronounce certain words and calling me a snake then saying tHeRE iSnT a ReASoN (even when there clearly is). \n\nOverall, I just feel like an asshole because I feel like it\u2019s my fault and idk what to do. I just want to go and hang out with other people who actually care (kinda) but I feel trapped. \n\nCurrently sat outside on cold-ass concrete writing this. They left and came back (20 minutes later) but didn\u2019t speak to me or say anything about leaving me behind.

Also, I'm on mobile,  yada, yada. \n\nWell... Something about me. Im an artist,  ilustrator,  concept artist. I love playing games,  I grew up with them and I love in-depth discussion about gaming. Currently working as a game tester and I also study Art in New Media on weekends. I also voice act,  sing, play few instruments  and study japanese as a hobby (was able to pass N5 level proficiency test). I sometimes stream too.  I like horror and fantasy books and movies. Snakes and foxes are my favourite animals.  I own a pet corn snake and three pet rats.  There is a lot of other things I like and do too I guess... I like to call myself a renaissance person. \n\nI'm not very good with people though...  I never understood them very much and I feel like I'm a burden to few friends I actually have...  I suffer from diagnosed depression and anxiety,  I was medicated in the past... I'm trying to push forward but sometimes there are days like today where I promised myself I'll work but I'm laying in bed since I came back from my job... \n\nAbout half a year ago things were different... Though  I suffered basically my whole life,  I was bullied at every school I went to,  was harassed and hated,  and I hurt myself a lot... I found someone that made me feel different. Someone thanks to whom I was able to give up on my medication. I was able to actually live a happy life, without constant panic attacks. I loved this person and cared for them more than I cared for myself... We sung together,  we wrote poems... It was great... \n\nThen one day,  suddenly this person told me that \"He does not love me anymore. \" He broke up with me while showering me with compliments.  \"You were great,  you helped me and pulled me out of the water.  But I woke up one day,  and stopped loving you. It's my fault. Not yours. \" ...I think this is when I broke...  For the longest time I couldn't eat or sleep...  I wasn't running back to him, and crying or stalking him...  I didn't want to be that clingy ex that brings him down with me. So I suffered by my own. It's going to be soon half a year since that happened.  And... I still love him. I did not talk to him since then. We didn't have any sort of contact. I tried my very best to just move on... But I can't. I feel like something holds my heart with it's claw... Like the time stopped that day. People are telling me that it will pass... That I need to try to love someone else... But I keep rejecting anyone that confesses,  simply because I know I won't be able to love them. And I don't want to hurt anyone... \n\nI did not come to this sub looking for a date... I guess I just wanted to talk to someone... My friends are getting tired of it... No-one knows how to help me. I'm scared...  Scared of being lonely... \nIf anyone has any idea what can I do...

I got like, 200 upvotes and what felt like 1000 messages. Everyone was so kind to me, whether they were searching for friendship or just wanted to stop by and keep me company for a few minutes. Stuff like that really restores my faith in humanity, which I lose way more than I would like to admit. I added a bunch of people and still have a few I talk to semi-regularly whom I would consider good friends. However, I still feel lonely, and I've been having some rough days and nobody had been around to talk on a consistent basis. I need someone to talk to today. I need a friend.\n\nI do feel bad posting again after the amount of interest I got on my last one. It feels greedy of me. I know there are others out there that have no one (or feel like they have no one) and they deserve friendship too, and I feel like posting again is in a way taking attention away from others. I responded to various others posts the last few days and haven't gotten a message back so I hope those people found what they were looking for. I'm not really sure why I'm mentioning that here, but this whole thing feels like a giant useless ramble and I wouldn't blame anyone for not reading it.\n\nOne of my problems is that I'm actually a pretty shitty friend. I fluctuate between clingy, excited and nosy, to disinterested, unmotivated and disassociated. I always either go too far, or not far enough, and there seems to be no in-between. I'm boring, I like to come off like I love trying new things, but more often than not I stick to the same few things I enjoy doing and never find the motivation to branch out. I struggle with boundaries. I get overwhelmed easily. I'm pretty sure I have some trauma I haven't fully gotten a hold of. I don't mean to sound like I'm putting myself down, but at times I'm not very easy to be friends with. In general I think the good outweighs the bad.\n\nI understand my loneliness doesn't have as much to do with who my friends are as much as it does my own insecurity/inner turmoil/issues. I don't expect anyone to fix that except myself, and I'm working on it. I just...don't want to be alone. Honestly, everything in me is telling me to delete all of this, but I'll just leave it all here and hope someone else can relate to it enough to reach out. My other post is still up if anyone would like more about myself.\n\nAlso, please, I don't really want \"advice.\" I'm starting up therapy soon and I don't want to be psychoanalyzed or told whats \"wrong\" with me or anything.

Its mostly because I told myself during my anxiety therapy that I will try to embrace the more emotional side of myself rather than pushing it away. It happens to be that I find it a lot easier to open up and be real about my emotions around women.\n\nNow lets get into it, so hey, I'm Bas. I'll just tell you some things about me real quick.\n\n* As stated above, I'm a medical student from The Netherlands, however, I'm in a gap year right now trying to improve as a person as well as make the right decisions in my carreer/life. As of now, I work two days a week at a pharmacy and 1 day voluntarily at a nursing home.\n* I love playing games, honestly, it's been this way all my life, since I was 12 I started speaking english with people all over the world. It fascinated me, it was my way out from reality and it still feels that way. Currently I mostly play league of legends, yet I would LOVE to try out new things.\n* I'm a sucker for pets and other cute things, as any man might have, I have an insane weak spot for pets. I have a dog, two kittens, a few chickens and Koi (and no I don't live on a barn). Theyre just amazing, animals are so innocent.\n* I'm a very deep person. I think a lot, hence why I might overthink a lot too ( I think lmfao). I love any topics going from current problems in society to medical problems, psychology, phylosophy and even more. Once something triggers my interest I tend to get very passionate about it.\n* I have social anxiety and I'm currently in treatment for it. To most people I don't seem like the person to be socially anxious. Yet I do suffer from it in my head. I'm a very spontanious and funny guy people usually say, yet we all know what is seen from the outside is not always what goes on in the inside. I also tend to be caring as it kind of makes me focus on other peoples problems rather than my own (my double edged sword).\n\nAnyways, I hope that kind of painted the picture to what I am like.

I prefer communicating on Discord over anything since I'm mostly looking for people to keep company whilst playing games, watching movies, or just talking to eachother over call!

Academically I'm doing fairly well, but it's getting harder and harder to keep my grades from slipping because of how I've been feeling.\n\nSocially though it's just been terrible. I'm a sophomore, and still haven't made any friends. I've tried to meet people, but it's just so tough for me. I can be really shy sometimes.\n\nI know it's not true but lately I've just been feeling like everybody hates me. Like everyone is hoping that I fail. My family is very supportive but sometimes I just can't help but feel like I'm an outsider and always will be.\n\nI just feel like... Incompatible. Like I don't have as much of a spark as everyone else. I'm a kind and genuine person I like to think, but it's just so hard to feel a connection with... Anyone!\n\nThe only thing that really gave me hope recently was that I was able to ask out this girl I worked with. We've gone on two dates now....over the span of like 3 months. She's the first girl I've ever asked out or been on a date with.\n\nShe is incredibly busy, but sometimes I just can't help but feel like she's ignoring me. I don't want to get too in detail because I'll feel bad haha.\n\nI've been asking for advice about stuff on a dating subreddit and every time they tell me that I should give up on her and that I'm doing everything wrong. It hurts so much to hear that.\n\nI've accepted that this might not work out with us, I get it.\n\nBut to hear that I need to change how I am if I ever want any success dating really stings to hear.\n\nI get that I have to be confident, I like to think that I am. But I don't do any mind games or anything like that.

He\u2019s always had anxiety and depression issues but now he\u2019s getting into drugs (beyond just cannabis) to cope with his problems. (I\u2019ll call him N)\n\nAt the start of our friendship a few years ago, he was dating a slightly overweight girl. However, me and some of my other friends started giving him shit about it. Looking back on it now I really regret it because it went too far and even though I thought it was all in good fun and we were joking, he didn\u2019t take it lightly and we almost ended up ending our friendship over this. However, nobody really apologized or said anything about it and we all moved on from it. \n\nLast year, my friends and I begin to notice that N was becoming increasingly distant and less outgoing and productive as he usually was. I was away at college at the time but my other two friends were attending a local community college at home with N. This is when I found out that N was blowing off class to stay home and get high. \n\nShortly after we made this discovery, he ended up failing out of that community college and has since worked a variety of dead end minimum wage pizza delivery jobs with no ambitions or passion to do anything else or to have a career or at least a good paying job. \n\nFast forward to April of this year, one of my other friends happened to stumble upon N\u2019s reddit account (that he has since deleted). It basically went into how he abused drugs before and during our friendship such as cannabis, his previous addiction to robitussin and other cough syrups, microdosing on LSD, xanax, and even some opiates (which also led to him losing his girlfriend who ended up cheating on him because of how distant and high he was becoming), how he went to various psych wards due to anxiety and depression issues, how he\u2019s considered taking his own life, and how he just drives around getting high in the woods because he\u2019s so lonely and unmotivated. \n\nHe told my friends and I (essentially the only support system he has) NONE OF THIS\n\nHowever, over time I have noticed that he always puts me down, picks on me, disrespects me, and never pays me back for anything I buy for him. He very rarely does this to our other friends and I believe he holds resentment against me for my friends and I (but especially me) \u201croasting\u201d his GF in our group chat. I totally understand I was in the wrong and it was a shitty thing to do in retrospect but I just think he never really forgave me for it and holds resentment towards me. \n\nAs it is, I almost ended my friendship with him over the summer because we got into a slightly drunken physical altercation over him being unwilling to share his vape with me after I bought him an 18 pack of beer and dinner that night and he again refused to pay me back. However, for the sake of our friend group I decided to forgive him and eventually moved on. \n\nCurrently, he spends all of his money on cannabis and smokes about 7-10 grams a week, only works 20 hours a week at a mediocre local pizza place with no sign of wanting to move on or get an actual job since he\u2019s not attending college. When he isn\u2019t working, N goes to various scenic places around the area and gets high all day and still lives at home with his parents, who he has a dysfunctional and negative relationship with because he has a history of stealing and lying from them. When I do ask him about what he wants to do after moving on from the pizzeria he\u2019s currently working at (which is at most 20-25 hours a week), he literally said to me \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter I\u2019ll be gone soon anyway\u201d and when I asked N what he meant by this he just said \u201cprobably dead I guess\u201d. This actually scares the shit out of me. \n\nN also engages in drag races a lot and has been driving increasingly recklessly lately. This sort of makes me uncomfortable to be around him as I\u2019m worried he\u2019s just living off adrenaline at this point with no consideration for his future or well-being. \n\nI really care about N and love him as if he was my brother. I want to help him but he is stubborn and in denial and unwilling to accept or deal with his problems. I was planning on finally confronting him about his disturbing reddit account when I get back home from college for break in a couple weeks but a part of me is just considering ending our friendship because I think it\u2019s just becoming too toxic and revolving around getting high and occasionally drunk together. In a way that\u2019s all we do anymore and while it\u2019s fun, I want our friendship to be more than that but it\u2019s being restricted by N\u2019s toxic habits. \n\nI also just feel like we\u2019re going down separate roads anyway as I\u2019m graduating college in May with my bachelors degree and most likely a solid career ahead of me, while he\u2019s still living with his parents and working menial jobs making money that just goes to weed. \n\nTL;DR: My relationship with my friend has gone downhill over time because of his destructive drug use and his resentment towards me for past events and I\u2019m currently considering if I should move on from him as a result. \n\nThank you to anybody who read this far.

I have a hard time making friends. I have never had a super close group of friends like most people my age have, so when this all began I was pretty excited. My parents are pretty strict about night time rules and curfew. I have to be home at 10 PM, Have to let them know where I am when, and can't go too far from the area our house is. This is because we have recently had a lot of nighttime drunk driving crashes in our area and my parents don't want me to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Most of these rules go out the window when the sun is up. I can go wherever I want, for as long as I want under the condition that I update them. Four of us are 17, one was 16. We all could drive and arrived individually. \n\nAt the company I work at, there is a group of teenage girls (I am the same age as these girls. And I am also a girl.) that I spent a lot of time talking to during our shifts. We all decided one night to make a big group chat so we could talk outside of work and make plans. (5 people in the group chat total). I was pretty excited to be included in this group chat becuase I hadn't had girls invite me into something like that. Everything was great at the beginning. We were all talking about work and school and boys and typical girl stuff. We decided to all go out to a local arcade/event place the next night (24 hours after the group chat was created). We texted the whole day long, basically nonstop (Important for later). I got permission from my parents, under the conditions that we didn't leave the building and that I was home by 10. I told the girls my parents rules, and they even agreed to meet up earlier so I could participate for more. Yay. \n\nWe all meet up in front of the building and it's packed. We didn't think that a Friday night might be super busy. We decided to go sit in one girls car and talk while waiting for one last friend to show up. When she came we moved to her car and listened to music and talked. After a while we were bored of talking but didn't want to go into the arcade because it was still packed. They wanted to go to one of the girls houses, but my parents didn't want me there without her parents there (I was texting for permission since I said I wouldn't leave the arcade until I came home). It definitely put a damper on the mood because I was that one person who couldn't do what everyone else wanted to do. There was more of them suggesting things and me having to say I couldn't do that because of my parents. (Keep in mind they knew my rules beforehand and I had no intention of breaking them.) We ended up running to a McDonald's that was next door and eating in the arcade parking lot. After that we went inside. \nWe all bought passes and decided to go on a high ropes course the place had that went over the arcade machines. I was wearing wedge heels that were not suited for a high ropes course, so I didn't exactly have the best time on it. Super nervous and not wanting to do anything too risky (I didn't trust the guy who tightened my harness). By the time we all got off the course and got our harnesses off it was almost 10, so I had to leave. Everyone else could stay till midnight or 2 AM. I left and went to bed.\n\nThe next couple of days were weird. No one said anything on the group chat. At all. We had used it constantly in the 24 hours between when we made it and went out, so I thought it was weird but I didn't say anything because I'm new to the whole girl group friendship thing. We went out on November 8th and the group chat has been totally dead. I tried starting conversations multiple times, but everything I said got a short response from one girl then nothing again. \nI recently found out that the whole group (minus me) has been going out and getting dinners and doing things together after everyone gets off work. People are nice to me during work and we chat but I had never been invited to any of the things they were doing. I'm feeling really bummed about being excluded like this. One of the girls in the group was a good friend from school and she casually mentioned that they all went out to the mall recently. Something I would have absolutely been able to do, had they asked. \n\nWhat should I do? Right now I really want to text the group chat and ask what happened and why I'm being excluded. It's really hurtful especially since I had no control over my parents rules. Is it a good idea to ask? Any insight into what they are thinking? I would love to hear a different perspective. \n\nCan give more info if needed.\n\nTl;Dr:\nWent out with a group of girlfriends from work, due to my parents strict \"after sunset\" rules I had to leave early and shoot down ideas on what to do when we were out. (They were well aware of what those rules were before we left) After an awkward night out, a group chat that had been frequently used before going out was dead. Since then I have been excluded from many gatherings and I don't know what to do.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I have ended up finding friendships with women who have acted as mother figures towards me.\n\nThey have all fallen apart at some point.\n\nI have always ended up feeling as though I have given a lot to these relationships. During my last friendship, I worked for this person, put in a lot of overtime, drove her children places, chipped in for household expenses, worked for her family's wedding venue business without being paid (they did provide me with housing). She was my primary emotional support through the past two years and I was told that I belonged to her family.\n\nEventually I burned myself out with the tasks I had been given because I was left to run the wedding venue by myself and didn't learn until after I agreed to help that the business was failing and in debt (I sold $40,000 worth of weddings to compensate for this). Once I said I didn't want to be involved with the project anymore, I was evicted from the family, asked to leave the house and replaced by somebody else.\n\nThis is my perspective.\n\nWhenever I have approached this person she has insisted that this is only my perspective and that none of these things are true, regardless of direct evidence such as text messages that I have brought to her attention.\n\nWhat leaves me questioning all of this is that in the end, I was left feeling desperate, but told that I was being manipulative, abusive, and controlling, and now I am constantly questioning myself.\n\nI am even questioning writing this post because I am afraid that I am doing it purely to get attention, manipulate people to be on my side, and to be told that I am not wrong, when really I might be the one who is completely wrong, without even realizing it.\n\nIt feels extremely confusing.\n\nWhen I read descriptions of codependent relationships, I find them relatable. When I read articles from other people who write about whether or not they should dump a toxic friend and describe a person who is overly emotionally needy, I can picture myself as sometimes having been that person and this makes me think that maybe I was a terrible friend and deserved to be cut out. By the end of this particular relationship, I felt completely dependent upon this person and I don't know if it is because I created that problems myself, or if it was because I was manipulated into doing things for this person.\n\nThrough this experience I was also diagnosed with manic depression and took the steps I was advised to take by this woman. I attended counseling, sought out a psychiatric nurse, was put on medication, and made an effort to take better care of myself in general.\n\nLooking back I can understand how I may truly have been a drain on the relationship emotionally by having some depressed episodes.\n\nI also feel that I was lied to in more than one circumstance and that whenever I attempted to express how I felt about the situation, it was turned around as being my problem.\n\nThe entire scenario has made me completely confused as to whether I caused the problem, or if I have a valid point of view.\n\nThe other aspect of this is that it is not the first time I have found myself in this type of situation and I do not know if it is because I am the person who is causing these conflicts and seeking to manipulate and control people, or because I keep allowing myself to participate in unhealthy relationships, or what the deal is. \n\nAt this point, I just want to know the truth. If it is my fault, then I will live with that. How do I find the reality?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

They are my best friends, they've helped me though tough times (my many depressive episodes and a suicide attempt), and I've always offered help in their times of need. We used to hang out at their home on weekends before they moved. We were super close. I even flew over to see them for the former's birthday in October this year (4000kms away), where we went camping with their friends and had a great time. \n\nSince then, I've noticed they stopped putting real effort into the friendship since then: they don't initiate any conversation with me anymore (I initiate by sharing something of mutual interest or a new milestone I achieved in my life or asking how an event or project in theirs is going). They don't initiate a damn thing nor ask about my health (they were the first people I opened up to about my depression years ago) or anything in my life. It is deeply hurtful and distressing to the point I'm really anxious that they're trying to phase me out of the life. It makes me feel unloved and unwanted and alone, and I have no idea how I can bring this to their attention. \n\nThere's so much I want to share and laugh and discuss with them - they are my best friends. However, their recent distancing makes me hesitate from always initiating conversation and I don't want to feel that I'm smothering them If they aren't pitt8ng an equal amount of effort into the friendship. It breaks my heart just thinking about not having them in my life entirely. \n\nHas anyone here gone through a similar thing, especially with someone close that moved away?

I'm Jon, a 21-year-old from Brazil that's looking for someone to spend the rest of his life with. Now, I do understand this may appear to be a dating post, but in reality it isn't. Can't we have a friend for the rest of our lives? Can't we trust all that we are to them and receive the trust they give to us? Can't we just deeply, deeply bond with them to the point we are one without necessarily engaging in sexual intercourse? I believe the answer to all these questions is we can, so under the rules of this sub, this thread is allowed to exist. \n\nSo, as you read, you'll probably postulate that I'm a mostly nice guy that shouldn't have difficulty finding other humans to be with. As you read, you'll understand why the way I am is precisely what makes that task difficult for me. \n\nI'm a youngster, I believe I can give myself that label, so naturally I'll want to be with other youngsters but the vast majority of them are way too different for me. They are too mindless and uncaring, they just care for parties, video games, TV shows and aren't willing to really put in the effort into connecting. Even those that say they are caring enough actually aren't.\n\nIf you the reader are like this, don't worry, it's not a critique, I think everyone can be whatever they want and that there is no better or worse person but nonetheless, being with people like these don't bring me much joy and I don't bring to them either and as I said, they are the majority, which explains my loneliness.\n\nOkay, so how am I and what am I looking for in a person?

I'd also note that I do suffer from a personality disorder, Schizotypal, which makes me super paranoid, depressed, and many other problems that could be the real problem. That being said, I am pretty aware what is real and what isn't, and voices in my head can't really persuade me (but really wear me down).\n\nSo I'm pretty lonely, I don't feel like I have a connection anyone, and I don't really spend time with \"friends\" anymore. Family, all the time, but everyone else has pretty much drifted away. The only people I've stayed in contact with is these three guys I play video games with. I contemplate cutting ties with them on a daily basis, and I get stuck in something like bad daydreams. I zone out and my mind goes through every single conversation that could lead to me telling them I'm done with them, with varying levels of things I would say to make them understand that I think they are to blame for our friendship breaking.\n\nI'll say they are A, B, and C.\n\nA was the one I met first. We would hang out quite a bit before he moved away with his wife, and we got a long very well. We still do well a lot of the time, but sometimes he upsets me quite a bit. He has a hard time controlling his temper, and the games we play together tend to make him pretty angry. One time I was feeling pretty sick, and he was yelling into his microphone about how the game cheated him. I got tired of it and I told him I disagreed. He yelled at me for ten minutes and disconnected from our call after. A few days later I told him I didn't appreciate it, and he pretended like it never happened. He also does this thing where we all plan to buy and play a game together, and he always chooses something (because my choices are bad) and after we play it for a little bit he drops it and moves on. Normally I wouldn't think it's a huge thing, but I lost my job a while ago (thanks to my disorder), and I tell him over and over that I'm not buying games anymore because I can't afford it. They just play new games without me, it makes me feel like I'm an NPC in an old game they threw away.\n\nB was living with A at the time I became friends with A, and became friends a little later. Honestly, he has the same issues as A, but I'm not even sure if he thinks of me as a friend anyways. We live about 20 minutes away from one another, and I use to ask him to hang out all the time, but I've given up because he can't or is too busy every time. Then he'll get online to play something a few days later to talk about how much fun he had with someone else. I understand not inviting me to a party I wasn't invited to, but it's been a year since we've done something together, and the two times before it was helping him pick out a tv, and then pick out a new headset.\n\nC is a friend of A's from high school, who traveled to the state we all lived in to hang out quite a bit. C is definitely the most aware of the three, but as of late I haven't really noticed it. The other day our conversation turned to something I thought was interesting, so I expounded on it. When I finished what I had said he said something like \"I tuned all that out, I'm not interested in anything you just talked about.\" He's said that almost 3 times to me in a week, and all different days. He seems pretty nice some days, and other days pretty abrasive. We don't spend a lot of time together, but I used to enjoy playing games with him.\n\nI've been stuck stressing out over this for about a week. On holidays A and C always come into town, and my paranoia is telling me they planned a day to hang out after thanksgiving, and didn't invite me. Sure, my paranoia isn't fact, but it makes my mind sprint off, because of course it's a possibility. It hurts so much. I go from feeling decent, from feeling used and alone, to angry and spiteful, and then cycle through every other day. I zone out constantly thinking about how I'd tell them I'm done with them, or how I ask them about them getting together without me, or how I'd tell them what they say about one another when the each of them don't get on. Is this kind of friendship what everyone deals with? Is it just my Schizo making me panic and feel rejected? Am I just not being understanding? I understand I'm not perfect either. I act like a know-it-all when it comes to movies and music, I can be pretty annoying, and I bottle things up pretty badly.\n\nSorry this is such a long post, but I feel like it would help to hear what others have to say. Am I right? Should I cut ties with them? I'll be friendless, but maybe it will be for the better, because right now I feel completely dismayed, to the point that I wish I didn't exist.

It doesn't matter what it is, be it love, friendship, or a discord community .\"Sic Parvis Magna\" - Greatness from small beginnings. This discord intends to stay smaller (think: 30-40 people) with an emphasis on building long lasting relationships with people who are not only like-minded, but share an interest in genuinely connecting over time. If you're just passing through, this discord won't be ideal for you. We cannot promise you will meet girls/guys here who you will click with if that's also what you're looking for. Hopefully you're somebody who wants to make real friends, eventually meet up, talk everyday, etc. all that stuff.\n\nThe current members of the discord are from another discord, we know each other very well. What does this mean for you? Well, it means not only do we have this type of experience, but we will also do our best to connect with you. This means if you're a shy type, we don't care. Extrovert? Great, you'll fit right in. Some of us play games, some do not, this is definitely not that type of discord. Since we're talking about creating connections with people, we do expect you to be not only real, honest, but we hope that you are willing to voice as well. Why? Real connections occur when real effort is put out. Text is great, and often times we can only text, but we want to get to know you. Talking over voice is a good way to do this, and I believe that it's the only way to get really close to somebody.\n\nThis discord is very small currently, you will be here at the beginning (and hopefully) for a long time. If you're looking for a very active discord, this is not that currently, though eventually it will be. If you're looking for good friends, chattin shit, banter and finding people long term to talk to, meet, etc, this is for you. Some things about the people in here: We banter, a lot. We make dark jokes, we typically don't view things as sacred bar certain topics, we definitely expect you not to bully people, and we expect you to put actual effort in to creating connections as it's the whole point of this discord. Ideally you are: Genuine, can banter, will not disappear (if we see a lack of effort we will simply remove you.), would like to voice, not an internet personality, etc.\n\nplease PM me if you're interested, thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnote- if you're dry and don't ever talk, you will probably just be removed -- your effort has to match others otherwise a friendship may never be formed.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Both of us have been suffering from depression, but the difference is that she\u2019s getting better while I just started my journey downwards. Before, up till a few months ago, things used to be amazing. We both loved each other, cared about each other, and were always there when we needed someone. But lately, it had been feeling like she stopped loving me, and stopped caring. I brought this up to her, and she got mad at me for not accepting her feelings. I do accept that she doesn\u2019t love me anymore, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I wish she did. She doesn\u2019t like the fact that I hope for that. Also recently, I have been feeling extremely left out. She and another one of my friends were my 2 closest ones, but they didn\u2019t know each other. And now because of a third person, who I am also friends with (not as close though) they have been spending more time together. This isn\u2019t right of me, but it does make me feel bad about being left out. Now, the two of them are closer and trust each other and laugh more around each other than I do with either one of them. It\u2019s as if they got closer and I got kicked out of both of their lives. My relationship with both of them has been so distant lately, and I talked to both of them about it. They even invited me to hang out with the three of them, but I felt as if it were out of obligation since I had complained about it earlier. The entire time, it was so awkward. They assured me beforehand that it was not out of obligation, but it still felt like it. The three of them were talking about things that they have in common (like a tv show they watched at a sleepover they had) and took pictures of each other and posted them on their Snapchat stories. I felt like I completely did not fit in. At home, I was going through Snapchat and saw everything, and it took me a while to remember that I had been there too. A few nights ago, me and my friend got into a really bad argument. I never wanted to open up, but I finally managed to and would tell her about how I felt. This time, however, she snapped at me. She got mad at me about how I am \u201ccontrolling\u201d and \u201cmanipulative\u201d and make other people feel guilty in order to get what I want. She told me that I\u2019ve been dragging her down and impacting her life negatively. I told her that if I really hurt her that much, then she should just leave. And that is what she did. I don\u2019t want to be a burden for her, so I am glad that she will be happier now, but I miss her so much. It hurts so bad. I want her back but at the same time I don\u2019t.

Is there a force beyond our control that influences or shapes our existence or daily lives, be it spiritually/religiously or even politically? \n\nI'm also just trying to branch out and find more friends here, people to share life's ups and downs with. No need to be serious 24/7 haha. I love painting, music, reading, photography, kayaking, the beach, spending time in nature etc... Can't wait to meet you all! (Just an aside, if you're comfortable talking on other platforms let me know!)\n\nEdit: Holy shit, thank you so much to everyone who is reaching out!! I wasn't expecting so many replies. I love meeting you all!! So sorry if it takes me a bit to respond; finals has started and I've been pretty busy. I will respond though!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I\u2019ve had a very rough couple of years and have found myself alone and depressed. Where do I start?\n\nI come from a poor family and owe over $70,000 in student loans. I can't help my parents yet and live paycheck to paycheck - I just have not made enough to really support myself beyond living and repaying. I am by far the most poor person I live with (and the only single one) and while everyone around me seems to be loving life and sharing it with their significant others and going out to have fun, I can only really afford to stay at home and watch movies by myself.\n\nI have a decent job in sales, and I am thankful for that. Life could be much worse. But I have always felt like the corporate life is just against me. I have watched my coworkers make tons of money by having great territories as work, while I always seem to get stuck in an unlucky situation. I am good at my job, my manager has even told me he thinks I am the best rep on my team.  I am in first, I am out last, and I think everyone would say I work the hardest (because I am so sick of being poor this has become my distraction from how miserable I am when I am home) but I have the worst territory in the organization and am not going to make any money this year once again. It is so frustrating to me that despite working so hard for so long, I am going to finish last on my team and make the least. It crushes me and the place that was once my distraction has started to make me even more miserable.\n\nAnd to top it all off, last year my girlfriend (at the time) gave me genital herpes. I have not told anyone in the world this because I am so incredibly hurt and insecure about it. The doctor said my gf at the time carried it and did not show any symptoms and transmitted it to me. We also were on track to break up before this happened, now I am alone and have been for over a year,  I have not had sex in what feels like forever, and I feel like no one will ever want to be in a relationship with me now. I don't even try. I am good looking-ish I think, but with no money and herpes I feel like I am just worthless as a potential mate and ive lost so much motivation to find affection.\n\nI dont know if this is the right place to talk or vent, but I could really use some help. I just have no one in my life to talk with any feel so alone with all these problems.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I confided in a few people close to me but I haven't felt understood. The whole thing might seem silly, it does to me when I think about it rationally, but it still hurts.\n\nLast year, I moved to another city for a few months. After a few weeks, I found an internship for my close friend in my new town and encouraged her to apply. She did and was successfully hired. I was very excited knowing that she would join me but also happy for her because she was having a hard time finding an internship. We lived together in a shared rental with another roommate. At first, things were fine and we were pretty happy with each other. After a while however, my friend and I started arguing about very silly things like movie interests but also about how she thought my anxiety (that she had apparently discussed with her mother already) was problematic and would make my future children mentally sick. This and other arguments made me feel very hurt and uncomfortable about confinding in her on future matters. After a while, I realized she was pretty annoyed with me and my perspective on things. After my job contract ended, I moved back home and she stayed there to complete her internship. I didn't cut ties with her but I didn't make efforts to contact her for about four months (she did text me once or twice and I replied telling her about my struggles and my depression). My intention was to distance myself because I didn't feel comfortable with her anymore. Moreover, I had a lot going on in my life after moving back home. I was very lost when it came to my career since my temporary job didn't work out like I had wished and I had other stress-related factors in my personal life. I was isolating myself and avoiding as much as I could my surroundings. Anyway, after a while, I got better and got back to a somewhat active lifestyle. I then heard from her friend that she said she lost trust me in me because she considered that I had abandoned her by not keeping in contact with her and that she believed that things between us would never be the same again. A few weeks after hearing this, I gathered my courage and wrote her a message explaining myself briefly. She replied with a long dramatic message that I can't recall well because it was a year ago and haven't read it since. I only remember that the message was really hurtful and dramatic and that it looked like yelling put in writing. Anyway, it really affected me, but after a few days, I replied and I explained myself to her. This time, she replied more calmly admitting her message could seem dramatic and that maybe with time we could mend bridges but that she doesn't think she could go back to where we were in our friendship. Wanting to fix things, I said that it was fine with me even if I thought she was exagerating. During the next few months, we texted many times (I mostly initiated it). It was not the same anymore because even though I wanted to mend bridges, I was still hurt by how she had been rough in her dramatic message. She also seemed distant. Still she and her roommate invited me to their apartment for a weekend a few weeks ago and I was a bit wary to go but went anyway, thinking it might be a good opportunity to solve things. I also needed to get away from my daily life and viewed it as a small vacation. Overall on this weeked, they were very welcoming and generous with me (I tried not to impose myself though) and I had fun with them. However, towards the end of my weekend, my friend and I somehow got into another silly argument. We were discussing a personal issue (that concerned me mostly) and she was being condescending towards me and my point of view and insisting pretty rougly I was wrong, etc. I acted diplomatically because I really wanted the argument to end since I had a hard time being talked to this way by her. After this argument, we all sat in the living room until I got teary and tried to hide it by going to the washroom. My friend did notice me being teary, but when I came back, we just went along with the evening. I don't blame her for not showing she cared, I know she is not good with other people's emotions but I realized when this happened that emotionally we are not connected. A few days after this vacation ended, I asked her if we could Skype. We made an appointment and we talked about what happened. I told her I felt that when we had our last argument it was too rough for me and that I believe our arguments should be more diplomatic. I also said that her tone during arguments is one of the reasons I distanced myself from her last year, but that I understood why she would have this tone (I have seen her argue with her sisters and it's rough). She replied saying I am asking her to be fake but that she understood. I said I was not asking her to be dishonest, just less rough, as I am probably more sensitive than others. She didn't seem to get it and seemed bothered (her eyes said so), but she said that it was all right, that she understood and she hung up. The end of the call seemed a bit awkward but I was proud of myself about expressing my feelings in a good manner. A few days after this call, she texted me a last dramatic message that I could barely read because I could see it was going to be rough. I finally read it and understood she was ending our friendship saying that what I talked about in our Skype call made her feel like shit and that last year I cut ties with her because of this kind of arguments which she didn't deserve after all the things she did for me when she moved in with me. I don't know what she is exactly referring too, because this was the first time she brought this up and I am not into transactional friendships. She finished her message with saying a few nice things by wishing me success in my future for instance and that if we see each other outside, we could salute each other. I replied to her message with a few small messages that showed I was in shock and very hurt, to which she replied that my hurt feelings were my problem, that her dramatic text was far from hurtful and to stop replying. However, after around 15 minutes, she put her phone on airplane mode like she usually does at night. After telling her I do not wish for her salutations if we were to bump into each other, I blocked her everywhere. Still, I am really having a hard time healing and have been heartbroken about it. I keep thinking of everything that happened, what I did and I said and what she did and said.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I started to get close to her and found out that we have a lot in common and really liked her. But as all girls do, she asked me who I liked. I said no one but she was persistent. She started naming a bunch of girls in our classes but I always said no. Then she asked if it was her and I froze. I just told her I would tell her at school but I just kept procrastinating. Then she just said forget it and I blurted out that I liked her. We were still friends and nothing got weird. But a couple weeks later she asked if I still liked her. I told her that I liked her but not in the romantic kind of way as much ( I hate myself for lying like that). Then everything went as normal until after we got back from summer. She and her boyfriend broke up (because they couldn\u2019t keep everything together because of the distance). I helped her cope with it and thought I would ask her out in a couple weeks or so when she felt better but one of our old friends had the same idea. He said he liked her but then he said he didn\u2019t and she was sad again. I AGAIN helped her with it and decided to wait a bit more. But now she has a new boyfriend. He is a great guy and I know she deserves home but I still have feeling for her and don\u2019t know if I should just forget it.

It's my first time posting here so forgive me if I make formatting mistakes. My relationship with my friend is a long and complicated one, so please bear with me.\n\nSo I've been friends with someone I'll call Dan for about a year now. Long story short we go to the same college, were introduced to each other by a mutual friend, and hit it off immediately, spending most of our time together. We became familiar with each other in a short amount of time, to the point where people thought we were dating. I saw him as family and coming to the realization of just how much Dan hates me has been extremely difficult for me.\n\nI can't say exactly when his feelings of hate started, but it definitely happened gradually. He would come to class with a stony face and just sit down, not talking to me at all. I assumed it was just because it was a morning class that he was in a bad mood, so I would try to be the cheery one making conversation in an attempt to brighten things up. I was always glad to see him anyway. Even though I was putting up a happy front however I felt I was constantly walking on eggshells, mirroring his feelings of low energy and saying that I was tired even though I felt the opposite, because it was awkward to be the bright and happy one while he was unresponsive. It was also around that time that he would say, \"I hate you,\" \"you're so weird,\" or \"You're a sl*t\" (even though I was far from it), and at the time I thought it was just a bad joke but now I see that he really meant it. I didn't know where I stood with him because I would share what was going on in my life and my troubles with him while he shared nothing. I would feel awful because he would take 3-5 hours to respond to my texts, or he would ignore my texts completely. He's a very private person who doesn't use social media, doesn't let anyone know where he goes (for instance abroad when school is out), doesn't talk about his family much or his other friends. He never gives straight answers when asked questions that are remotely personal, so I know that even if I tried to talk things out it wouldn't work. He's naturally charismatic and widely liked, but doesn't seem to keep in contact with many people except for a few close friends that he visits regularly... bottom line is he isn't someone who expects (or hopes) that friendships last into the future, which is somewhat cold and hurtful. My other friend once brought up that she wished to remain in contact even after we graduate, but he replied with, \"we'll see\". He said that he likes to be the one in control of a relationship, which may be why he doesn't have social media\u2014he doesn't like to be found, and he doesn't like to be contacted. It's rational to know that relationships don't always work out, but if you like someone as a friend the normal reaction would probably be to react positively.\n\nIt was a painful decision of mine to distance myself from Dan over the summer, but I had finally come to the realization that I deserved better. It just got to the point that I would feel drained rather than energized after hanging out with him, and he honestly affected my sense of self-esteem so much because I was the one giving and giving with nothing in return. I ceased all contact with him and became content with life without him\u2014or so I thought. The problem I have is our relationship right now\u2014I have my walls up around him yes, but I can't bear to let go... I don't want him to hate me. He picks out my flaws and disguises them as jokes, indirectly takes jabs at me, sometimes frowns so deeply like he disagrees with everything I'm saying but holds his tongue, doesn't say hi to me even when we're in the same room, and doesn't even bother to try starting a conversation with me. Is there a way to mend this relationship, or is it dead? Would it be best if I just move on? Is there something I could have done differently? Is there a chance of forgiveness on both sides? It's hard to let go because I've never hated him; it's him who harbors feelings of resentment towards me.\n\nSome reasons as to why he might hate me: we most likely spent too much time together and he probably got bored, but another thing is that I'm a naturally touchy-feely person who gives hugs and whatnot\u2014he is someone who doesn't really like physical contact. When people hug him he doesn't hug back, and he verbally asks people not to touch him. I slap him lightly when we're joking and stuff and I hug him when we're saying goodbye and stuff, but that's pretty much it. Maybe this habit of mine along with being comfortable with him (and at times I will admit maybe clingy) gave off the impression that I liked him romantically even though I don't?? To be frank it's pretty clear that he's not straight. I've learned to not be clingy and learned to be alone with myself... is there a chance of salvaging this friendship, or should I just leave it?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Also if you miss a day or two its fine get back on track and keep sending I understand life can be crazy, hectic and whole lot more.\n\n So after the year and we both survived I would like to have a voice chat and see what we learned about each through just the photos and what we misread about each other? Plus reflect on all the ups and downs we had during the year. If at any time you would like to stop the experiment just please text stop or I'm Done in the WhatsApp chat. But if your still interested please DM me and I will add you on WhatsApp. Then I will just need three things from you before we start \"your name(what you go by), Age, and where do you live(City/Town-Country).\" From there I will tell you the day the experiment starts and from then on it will just be Photos. Can't wait to find out who you are!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Feel free to talk to me or play a game with me!", "author": "Gatonon", "self_text": "Wow, I don't know where to start, first time ever posting on Reddit, but I couldn't help it after seeing all of the posts in this thread...Maybe I should start with what my core values are?\n\nI personally think that we all live in a time that is currently a bit more focused towards Individualism. I definitely think that there are a lot more people who feel lonelier than ever. There are also a lot of voices that do not seem to manage to reach our ears, let alone our hearts during the chaos of what we call life, whether it would be from people who try their very best to live quietly, carrying their own personal burdens throughout their day to day lives, or people who are earnestly searching for help, but just can't quite find it.\n\nI am currently in my second year of university and am majoring in Business Administration. I am also currently working directly underneath my professor as an Intern. I work with high school students as their mentor and teacher(part of the job, something I was uncomfortable with too since I don't socialize a lot!). I've found out over the years, that the more you work with teachers and students or anyone else that you can personally interact with really(doesn't have to be related to teaching!), the more you learn about and contemplate your own life.\n\nThere are many stories that I have heard and seen over the years while working with them. Some were very bright and casual, while others were a little more on the darker and personal side of things. I can say for sure though, that those were some of my most memorable moments. Each and every single story fleshed out their personality, and gave me a little glimpse behind their mask per say. I can confidently and proudly say that they all were definitely my finest students, even if some of them may have been a bit rough around the edges.\n\nThe lessons that I've learned were the importance of each and every individual person, their uniqueness, and their strong, common desire for companionship filled with kindness and compassion, regardless of differences.\n\n**Enough about that though, let's get onto the main point.**\n\nAnyways! My name is Peter. I am male, 19. I live in the United States, State of Oregon.\n\nI would like to extend this invitation to everyone when I say this, but I would like to be your friend! Again, I think it's a little bit harder to make friends these days, or at least keep in touch with them, but even so, I would like to offer my friendship. The world always feels just a little bit brighter with company, and the journey always feels that much shorter as well, that is what I believe.\n\nI play a lot of video games mainly on PC, avid fan of them! Games that I have recently played are:\n\nLeague of Legends, SMITE, Rainbow Six Siege, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Monster Hunter World, BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle, Guilty Gear, Soul Calibur 6, Tekken 7, Black Desert Online, Vindictus, Mabinogi, Maplestory, Kurtzpel, Dead By Daylight, Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, Company of Heroes 2, Sid Meier's Civilization 6 **and a lot of other games!**\n\nI love reading books, light novels, manga and watching anime! My favorites so far:\n\nNo game no Life, Sword Art Online, Accel World, Full Metal Alchemist, Overlord, Dr. Stone, Black Clover, Demon Slayer, My Hero Academia, One Punch Man, Beelzebub, Date a Live, Your Lie in April, Gintama **and a lot of other anime too!**\n\nAlthough I sound very confident and maybe a bit too idealistic, I am actually very introverted! I don't really talk too much, I have always been a bit too focused in my studies and hobbies ever since I was a child. However, I will say that I will try my absolute best to be there for anyone who wants my company, **but I do want to apologize** before hand if it ever seems that I am being a bit cold. I am not that good at keeping conversation, but I would be very happy if I could play a video game with you or lend my ear to you! Again, feel free to talk to me or come and hang out. I have both Steam and Discord, feel free to PM me if you would like to exchange contacts!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

When she got into my class, she noone wanted to be her friend, well except for me. I tried talking about her to my friends but they thought she was just weird (for context, she compared my old hag of a teacher to I believe it was a librarian from Monsters Inc that said Mike Wasowski's name in a raspy tone. I was the only one who laughed). We were good friends, and after a few weeks, my friends finally saw how cool she was. Then the \"cool kids\" noticed her, I'm guessing you can see where this is going.\n\n  So she got a taste of popularity and left me and most of my friends, which is terrible considering I was her only friend in the class for about a week. Then she went around and started flirting with and \"dating\" most of the boys and girls (she's bi). Her exact explanation was, I'm not kidding, \"It's fun seeing them getting excited about having a girlfriend,  I don't actually like them\". So I tried to correct her, \"Allison (her name), you can't do that, do you know how seriously f****d up that is?\" She just didn't care. On top of that, after I talked to her about it, she tried to date my friend, Dylan, because, \"I feel bad that nobody likes him\", WHAT?! He is supposed to be your friend, you don't say that about your friends. She says a lot of messed up things, including calling me names (fat, man tiddies, etc.) but I don't care because I am fine with that. Dylan politely declined because \"Danny likes her and he would be upset, and I don't want to hurt his feelings\" I do like her, but that is a story for a different sub. Dylan is a great friend. I just feel like she has left her best friends in the grade for a few people she can't even trust.\nTL;DR: my friend got a taste of popularity and is now a 7th grade slut.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm at the point no where I'm focusing on healthier choices and moving forwards. Trying to keep busy, but I have very few people in my life and can only keep so busy. I've got a couple of buddies who are pretty busy, I often don't see them for months at a time.\n\nI've always kinda been a lone wolf, not really by choice but I chose to accept it. It's been a rollercoaster of a year and I'm finding myself with alot of free time these days and very few distractions. I'd love to just have someone to chat with, fire off some memes, talk about life. If you've got things going on, I'm happy to listen. :)\n\nGenerally I get along better with women but I don't really care. I'd prefer to talk to someone who's interested in a legitimate friendship. Don't have to talk every day, but it would be nice to get more than 1 or 2 replies and not be ghosted after. (You guys know it's perfectly fine to tell someone that you just don't get along right?)\n\n\nA couple of interests/conversation starters: I'm big into sci fi, books, games, anything. I'm absorbed in the mandalorian right now, I love it. \n\nI know a fair bit about beards because people in public see a beard on my face and ask me what my secret is. Eventually I had to start doing some research for my own knowledge and so that I wasn't pointing people in the wrong direction. I get asked about it ALOT. It really baffles me.\n\nI'm Canadian, if you're from another country I wanna hear your Canadian stereotypes. They're hilarious. I always wonder what the rest of the world thinks of us. Also, I do smoke a fair bit of weed, I feel like that's important to mention because some are very against pot smokers.\n\nI'm into pretty much any music, could use some recommendations on some more upbeat/happy music. I'm really into Modern warfare right now but I have a massive library of games.\n\nAnyways that's a big wall of text and it's getting longer the more I write, shoot me a message if you think we'd get along.

It's me again, but you probably don't really remember me. I am from Belgium and I would love to make more friends. I just got out of a very very toxic 'friendship' (the type of guy who thinks it's very normal and okay to yell at your friends and call them names. Big yikes) and I'm very positive now. It's still a bit difficult amd it still hurts a bit, but I am working on it and ready to move on. \n\nI will tell you a little bit about myself:\n\n- I am part of the LGBT+ community so I don't want to talk to someone who hates that community or does not agree with it. \n- I LOVE animals and I really enjoy working with them. I do horseback riding and I did it in various styles. I currently do it in the English style. I also have a mule and a shetland pony, I mostly work with the mule and I absolutely love him. I also have a cat who is the king around the house.\n- I used to game, but I don\u2019t really do that anymore since I don't have my own laptop or computer. I do have a nintendo DSI and I'm currently saving up to find some games at the local flea markets (they sell them really cheap there lol) \n- I love 'Stranger Things' and Hopper, Dustin, Joyce, Steve and Robin are my favourites. \n- I like to watch Netflix and series. A few series that I watch are Boku no hero academia, Yuri! On ice, Sex education, the end of the f***ing world and Steven Universe. \n- my favourite films are Alegria, Spiderman far from home, Ready player one, Fantastic beasts the crimes of Grindelwald and how to train your dragon. \n-I like all kinds of music, but not modern rap or explicit songs about drugs, sex or alcohol unless they have a good story. I don't like those because they often don't have a story behind them. \n- my favourite groups/bands are Gorillaz, Queen, Arctic monkeys and Cavetown. \n-I don't do drugs and I don\u2019t really drink, but I'm not like one of those I will kill you if you that type of guy. I would appreciate it if I could find someone who has more or less the same view or doesn't do drugs.\n-I really like musicals :) \n-I don't have discord or snap, but I do have Facebook (I know, I'm so old school for my age :p ) and instagram\n-I like to joke around \n-I'm an artsy type of guy\n\n\nI know that it's an awful lot of things, but I wanted to describe myself (amd for what people I am looking for) as best as I could. Please don't let it scare you, I really like to talk and I want to try to meet new people :) \n\nHave a nice day/night!

Been shot at, had knives pulled on me, sexually assaulted, have had a hard time interacting w others since all this", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "Thing is I go weeks wo talking to anyone. Agoraphobia. Had been overweight my whole life until I was 27. 27 I got to a healthy weight for the first time in my life and have maintained that weight loss. I had been told I am quite thin on a few occasions these days which is weird to me. I was doing really well getting over my social anxiety. Then 3 women came into my life, got the closest I had ever been to a relationship. But they were all so horrible. They completely obliterated me. My agoraphobia's come back with a vengeance. Really they were the pure embodiment of evil. One of them kissed me a lot, wanted to sleep w me, she was calling it \"therapy\" bc a 50 yr old woman got me drunk when I was 20 took my virginity wo my consent. So this lady earlier this year said she wanted to help me feel comfortable sleeping with women. She told me she loved me though and I couldn't say it back. So, she then tried to do everything she could to ruin me, ruin my life, get me kicked out of my place, whatever. Thing was I was a little happy bc I thought I had found a friend, then she did all that. That was the worst thing anyone's ever done to me. Been shot at, had knives pulled on me. Really agoraphobic these days, I hate going outside. I am used to going weeks without talking to anyone. It's how I spent most of my life. I haven't had many friends. I always kept to myself really. I'm normally ok but kind of think I do better mentally and even physically feel better when I feel like I have a friend I could talk to.\n\n\nMy bed is shivering in the dark yellow the streetlight has decorated the silence in my room with as it is passing through my barely opened blinds. I'm not even here. There's nothing going on here. Captivated with anxiety at how boring things are. I am in a dream, but a dream where if I were to fall against the concrete, I won't wake up, rather I will lay there bleeding. I can't think straight at all only in circles that end up spinning out of control. My life feels like one of those black paintings by De Goya. I'm falling to pieces. Constant headaches. Harsh pain at the back of my neck. Smoking a lot of marijuana. Wanting to obliterate myself. Not be aware of the things going on around me. Wanting to disappear. Praying for St. Jude to hear my cries for help.\n\n\nI have very intense interests and think that maybe part of my problem is I sacrificed a social life to pursue my interests. I love writers like Moravia, Kobo Abe, Giacomo Leopardi, Cesare Pavese, Guido Ceronetti, Yasunari Kawabata, Comte de Lautreamont, Baudelaire, Huysmans, Rimbaud, Trakl, Thomas Bernhard, Paul Celan, Hermann Broch, Max Blecher, Emil Cioran, Andrei Platonov, Lev Shestov, Mikhail Bulgakov, Yukio Mishima, Osamu Dazai, Haruo Sato, Sakutaro Hagiwara, Julien Gracq, Dostoevsky, Chateaubriand, Gerard de Nerval, Nietzsche, Kafka, Kierkegaard, Clarice Lispector, Antero de Quental, Anna Kavan, Alejandra Pizarnik, Antonio Porchia, Adolfo Bioy Cesares, Raymond Roussel, Proust, Shakespeare, Holderlin, Paul Valery, Mallarme, Yves Bonnefoy, Unamuno, Byron, Blake, Poe, Emily Dickinson, Coleridge, Robert Anton Wilson, Maeterlinck, Pascal, Jakob Boehme, August Strindberg, Henrik Ibsen, Knut Hamsun, Louis Ferdinand Celine, Jankelevitch, Bergson, Henry Vaughan, John of Ruysbroeck, Albert Camus, Georges Palante, Simone Weil, David Gascoyne, Pierre Reverdy, Rene Char, Unica Zurn, Meister Eckhart, Kobayashi Issa, Basho, and quite a few others I can't think of off the top of my head. I studied existentialism and phenomenology in college. I identify as Catholic. I like the theology of Hans Kung and the Jansenism of Pascal and very influenced by medieval mystical writings like the Sister Catherine Treatise or the Imitation of Christ. Also Zen Buddhism and Jodo Shinshu. I love music - Joy Division, the Cure, Depeche Mode, Current 93, Captain Beefheart, Atrax Morgue, Swans, Can, Kraftwerk, Velvet Underground, Scott Walker, White House, Nick Cave, Einsturzende Neubauten, Arne Nordheim, Sofia Gubaidulina, Giacinto Scelsi, Nico, Penderecki, Pierre Schaeffer, Pierre Henry, Nurse With Wound, Psychick TV, also quite a few others. Interested in dreams and surrealism. Love painters like Nicolas de Stael, Van Gogh, Cezanne, Leonora Carrington, Giorgio de Chirico, Renee Magritte, Francis Bacon. Japanese aesthetics and art. Films by Ingmar Bergman, Tarkovsky, David Lynch, Hitchock, Michelangelo Antonioni, Chris Marker, Jean Cocteau, Kenneth Anger, Maya Deren, quite a few others also here. \n\n\nOh and I love British humor.

I feel so disconnected from them now even when we do hang out it is a bit awkward and I dont relate to either of them anymore\n\nWhen we hang out it seems to be them complaining about how hard their lives are and how they haven't found their passion in life so everything feels so meaningless. Which I completely get as I felt the same before but now I am not in the same boat. I have found a career path I am good at and have found what I'm interested in doing and am working on that in my spare time. I want to keep these friends but I just find myself not being able to join in on the moaning sessions about their lives because I'm actually quite happy in my life. I find myself being emotionally drained by them. \n\nI have tried to give advice which they never listen to. I have tried just listening, thinking maybe they just need to vent but then it just ends up with silence afterwards which is awkward. They're both very socially awkward anyway and have struggled to make new friends. I have managed to make some new friends since moving here. I dont feel like I can tell them any funny stories or anything because they just make me feel bad for them  not having made friends.\n\nI try to talk about doing new things and they complain about how scary everything is and trying new things is so hard.\n\nI'm of a very different mindset where I love doing new things all the time. I just feel like the odd one out because I dont hate my life as much as they hate theirs. \n\nI feel like I'm unintentionally boasting when I'm updating them on my life because they constantly compare it and I end up feeling bad that I cant share anything with them.\n\nI kind of want to stop being friends with them because it's so draining to be around people that just want free therapy all the time but I dont want to not be friends with the only 2 friends i still have from uni because we have so many good memories.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?

I run my own business and have for years so I tend to struggle knowing when people want something from me or they are actually my friends. I am easy going, I love to listen and can also be quite talkative. My strength does not lie with writing though, so you'll have to be pretty tolerant of horrible grammar and a few misspelled words.

We are going on to senior year next year and we have been friends for about 18 years so basically forever. I consider us best friends and we get along well and have no problems. So time came to resign our apartment and he said he was looking at houses, however this passed and I sent a group text out to see if everyone was going to resign before I signed the papers. One said yes, and my friend say 90% sure it\u2019s yes. So I signed the papers and got it over with. So, now a week later he told me he was gonna sign last night and didn\u2019t. He now has found a house and is going to look at it, and he convinced my other roommate to look into it too. So basically if they go sign the house I\u2019m going to be signed to my apartment alone and they are going to leave me. He said that it\u2019s his dream and bc he wants to go wild senior year, but I figured we would be 21 in 3 months and it wouldn\u2019t matter. He just wants the house to party and it\u2019s gonna be more than I can afford anyways. However, that doesn\u2019t matter because I already signed the apartment. So, is he being a bad friend for telling me he was going to resign then he takes our other roommate to go somewhere else. Or am I being inconsiderate of his \u201cdream\u201d to party in a house his last year. I just thought if I was in his spot I would go oh man okay well I\u2019ll sign with you again. It just seems he\u2019s only thinking about himself in this situation rather that me too. I do mention that last time this happened before bc he was going to leave me to live with other people if I didn\u2019t live where he wanted.

Guess resting bitch face rubs off into my voice. I wheeze sometimes especially when I find something super funny. Sometimes I'm actually not sad or angry but I just sound that way. \n\nSelf depreciating humor is a plus in my book. I can relate well. I do like to talk and listen about family life, what happened today, the \"tea\". I just want a friend. I don't mind giving out my Facebook or phone number if we've played a long time. I treat online people like real-life friends, I want to find someone that feels the same.\n\nI really love memes, meme sharing is a true way \nto bond imo. \n\nAlso I vape, it's not loud since it's an rda, hope that isn't a problem? \n\nPM if you want my PSN :)\n\nEdit: I've made a post in the past on here that is very detailed in interests and stuff but was told it was to long :/ you can check my profile if you want.

I am a stay-at-home-dad and now that my younger child is in school, I am looking for someone to chat with during the day.  I studied art and German Lit in school, but have a lot of different interests.  I read a lot and like novels and literature but also read non-fiction.  I like movies old and new, and I like Graphic Novels. Depending on the day and subject, I speak German fluently and I lived in Germany for a few years in my twenties. Music has been a big obsession for me and I like a lot of different styles of music and I played in bands when I was younger.  I am very open minded and like people who are honest.  I don\u2019t really care what age you are but maybe being finished with school is good.  I like hearing people talk about their life and their family and what that was like growing up.  Listening to people\u2019s stories is really interesting to me.  I am open to people from anywhere, male or female, and don\u2019t mind if you are weird, just be positively weird.

I will send her a brief message (like \"how's the new job going?\", that kind of thing or a link to a trailer to a TV show we both like), but now she won't reply for about a month. So I leave it.

I say \"no worries, I understand it's busy with a new job and a new course\" or something to that effect and then I reply to her message.\n\nBut then it starts all over again, where she won't reply for another month, and then will send another block text (this time including the excuse that she was busy because her boyfriend's mum and the mum's friend stayed at their house for a week and the mum's friend got an infection on her knee).\n\nI'm just bored of it by this point. I just want to have a normal conversation rather than receiving guilt-laden essays every month.

Its mostly because I told myself during my anxiety therapy that I will try to embrace the more emotional side of myself rather than pushing it away. It happens to be that I find it a lot easier to open up and be real about my emotions around women.\n\nNow lets get into it, so hey, I'm Bas. I'll just tell you some things about me real quick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* As stated above, I'm a medical student from The Netherlands, however, I'm in a gap year right now trying to improve as a person as well as make the right decisions in my carreer/life. As of now, I work two days a week at a pharmacy and 1 day voluntarily at a nursing home.\n* I love playing games, honestly, it's been this way all my life, since I was 12 I started speaking english with people all over the world. It fascinated me, it was my way out from reality and it still feels that way. Currently I mostly play league of legends, yet I would LOVE to try out new things.\n* I'm a sucker for pets and other cute things, as any man might have, I have an insane weak spot for pets. I have a dog, two kittens, a few chickens and Koi (and no I don't live on a barn). Theyre just amazing, animals are so innocent.\n* I'm a very deep person. I think a lot, hence why I might overthink a lot too ( I think lmfao). I love any topics going from current problems in society to medical problems, psychology, phylosophy and even more. Once something triggers my interest I tend to get very passionate about it.\n* I have social anxiety and I'm currently in treatment for it. To most people I don't seem like the person to be socially anxious. Yet I do suffer from it in my head. I'm a very spontanious and funny guy people usually say, yet we all know what is seen from the outside is not always what goes on in the inside. I also tend to be caring as it kind of makes me focus on other peoples problems rather than my own (my double edged sword).\n\nAnyways, I hope that kind of painted the picture to what I am like. I hope to see some of you appear in my messages or on Discord! (BasBs#8884) I prefer communicating on Discord over anything since I'm mostly looking for people to keep company whilst playing games, watching movies, or just talking to eachother over call! If you play League its a plus!\n\nIll see you either on discord or in my dms!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We would talk for hours on end seven days a week, and it was the best time ever. We became attached to one another, and it felt like we were in our own world. I was the quite introvert and they were the wild one. We opened up to one another about a lot of personal things, and it felt nice to have someone who understood me but then came the first bump in the road. I wanted to spend more time revising for the upcoming exams, so i told her if we could call less and at first she seemed completely fine about it but then when i got home they were really mad at me and said that it really upset her. I was completely surprised by this and apologised and she did as well saying that they were just feeling emotional and it won't happen again.  \nA couple of months pass and i'm learning more about them but also having some nagging thoughts at the back of my mind that something isn't right but i always dismissed them because i thought if i addressed them then i was a bad friend and insensitive to their issues. There were also some things that confused me to no end and i'd get really upset about.  \nTo make a long story short they had some questionable behaviours such as:   \n\\- Drinking vodka at school once a week, every two weeks, three times a week and then having me to look after them as they didn't want any of their other friends knowing. They said they did this to self-medicate for their panic disorder. There was one incident when they mixed this with their medication and that was not a fun time trying to control them. They still did this even though i clearly didn't like it.  \n\\- Cutting themselves on their hands and then talking about how teachers, friends and family kept asking what had happened and if something was wrong. When i asked them why they were doing this and if it was self-harm they became really offended and said they're not like those 'emo people' and that they just like doing it. Then when i asked why you don't stop if your just doing it for fun so that people can stop being concerned about you they got annoyed by that and thought if they did it on their hands people wouldn't think its self-harm which i thought was questionable.  \n\\- Constantly talked about how they wanted to kill themselves when they were older.   \n\\- Made it very clear how they didn't like eating and wanted to be skinny while also restricting the amount of food they ate when around me but would act completely different around other friends and would eat just fine and wouldn't make a any issue about it  \n\\- Also made it clear she talked about me to her sister frequently about things that i've done that have annoyed her and that her sister agreed with but would never say what these things were and would try and drop the conversation which progressively made me more paranoid about her and myself as a person.   \nAs a result of all this things didn't seem all shiny and fun anymore and i became more and more concerned about her. The problem was she didn't like me asking questions about her mental health (she had a number of other issues that she would only vaguely mention.) and i didn't have anyone else to talk to so it was just me in my head arguing with myself over and over again. It got to the point i was walking around eggshells because i couldn't tell if she was being serious or not with some of her problems or if i was just being paranoid. I began to change my personality just to please her so we wouldn't get into arguments and this got worse when we went to separate schools. I began to think she hated me and that all my other friends hated me aswell so i ended it. 2 months have passed since then and i've been at my new school for 4 months and i'm still afraid to make friends.\n\nTL;DR I think i was in a toxic friendship and now i'm still scared to make friends 4 months into my new school because i think i'm a bad person for ending a friendship with someone who wasn't mentally stable and was making me paranoid about everything", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I won\u2019t talk about the second one cause for this it doesn\u2019t matter. In our little group it\u2019s me my friend C and my friend N. \nFor the past couple years me and C have gotten a lot closer then she or I am with N or any of our friends.\nRecently, N has gotten a bf and doesn\u2019t hang out with us like ever. But that doesn\u2019t rly bother me since I\u2019m very introverted by nature and tend to avoid people. (Other then C my legit best friend who I tell everything)\n\nI\u2019ve actually noticed more and more that when we are hanging out with N all together C tends to gravitate (for lack of a better term) towards N. \nAnd a big things is with sc or Ig stories. C tends to be very self centerd and thinks she\u2019s like perfect so she post a lot of herself on her storiess. But never when she\u2019s with me. (We are always in our phones since we are teenage girls)\nBut she never takes pictures or records videos of us when it\u2019s just us.\nBut when we are with N (or when she\u2019s alone with N) she records everything and post it allllllll. A big example is on my birthday, it was a mess but me and C did everything within like an hour. She didn\u2019t record anything till N got there. And then the only thing she posted was of N. Legit she takes a pictures in my bedroom (with my dop ass mirror) together and post it everywhere along with videos of them doing stupid shit and disrupting my house while N was \u201cchanging\u201d so non of my other friends would go. And when she post on ig I barley ever get tagged. (It\u2019s a thing to tag your closes friends)\n\nThis leads me to believe maybe she\u2019s embarrassed of me? But Also N has less contacts and has a bad rep and less followers then me. So I dunno bout that.\n\nBut then another is she complains about N constantly and then turns around and leaves me out.\n\n(Another thing could be N got nicotine, but I think that shits dumb so I don\u2019t)\n\nEither way this is way to long as it is, if you\u2019ve read this far what do you think I should do?\n\nIt really does make me sad and I honestly sometimes feel like dropping her.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I also understand that many of this could just be me, but I want to know I should bring up my concerns about our friendship or not to them.\n\nOne of my most frustrating concerns is that I feel like they don't care that much for me. I know they do, in the end, but they never really show it. No one ever says like, \"I care about you\" or even do many things like it. If I get it, it's like I basically pulled it out of them, or it's expected (like at a birthday or something). They never wait for me whenever I'm doing something and we're heading somewhere. I could be locking my dorm and the three of them begin walking away, not even looking back. Or we'll swipe into the dining hall and they're already halfway to a table before I have to run after them. I've mentioned my frustration with it before, but they kind of just brush it off.\n\nI also really don't like that I feel like I force them to do things. I'll ask them if they want to come with me next door to grab some random item from CVS, and I do want them to come because we'll be hanging out for the rest of the time anyway and they groan and moan about it. I then say \"it's ok you don't have to come\" but then they're like, \"no it's fine\" but they seem annoyed and very reluctant. I hate it when they do that, because it's such a simple easy thing, and I want to be in their company. But then I feel horrible knowing that they'd rather not be there- and makes me think it's me. \n\nOne of the biggest culprits is I wanted to go to New York for my birthday over the weekend, and we had planned it together weeks beforehand and agreed. But now that it's getting closer some of them have voiced their opinion that they'd rather not go. I sadly ask, \"do you not want to go? We don't have to if you don't want to\" but they just say, \"no it's fine.\" Like why would you act like that if you're just going to say it's fine and go anyway? It makes me feel so bad, and I no longer want to go, thinking I'm forcing them.\n\nI don't know, sometimes I feel like I care way more than they do about people's feelings and our relationship, but I guess I expect that same stuff back too. I just feel underappreciated sometimes, and even as if I'm being annoying or that they don't like me that much- since their always annoyed or frustrated with my plans.\n\nI don't know if I should mention my laments to them, because I don't want to sound crazy or super clingy or anything. I just get very sad when they don't show affection and that they care about me. They also rag on me a lot and kind of tease me, and I play along, but honestly some of the stuff they say kind of hurts and I get concerned that they actually mean it. I've been feeling very sad with this relationship every once in a while. I can deal with it most of the time, but sometimes it gets a lot and I just feel so bad when I'm with them (at certain times). Other times we have a really good time, but it's very high highs and low lows :/. What should I do about this? Thanks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My friends don't seem enthusiastic to spend time with me and do things together. I feel like I'm forcing them to do stuff with me, and they're reluctant. They also seem somewhat indifferent toward me and leave me behind a lot. I don't know if I should bring this up to them or not in fear of sounding crazy and clingy", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

So I would go every now and again, at one point when I returned the group had split in two there had been a fight so I finally was able to 'get in' per say. I didn't take sides and merely said that I'm not interested in who did what and in my own time I will make my decision if I feel there needs to be one. Anyway time went by hung out with both sides until eventually they started coming back together and we would all hang out, have parties etc. \nOne time we all pitched in for things and someone took money from me and a couple of the others presumably while we were sleeping - everyone was mad and so was I but I tried to be compassionate and thought maybe something happened and whoever it was, was in a bad spot and had a lapse of judgement. So I proposed the idea that who ever it was returned the money $30 -$40 in total I think in an envelope anonymously at the friends who were hosting that night, and I trusted them to pass my $10 back to me. I don't know to this day if it was ever returned or not - if it was it was kept quiet from me and I never got my bit back.\n\nThe last party we had is where my main problem lies. We were drinking, I'd had a hard week with family so I drank quite a bit. At one point after I was fairly drunk I was getting bored so i went and layed on this ground hammock thing considering crashing on the couch, I finally got up and went to head inside (to the couch) the one hosting that night came up to me and asked if I had taken the rum - I don't drink rum ever it makes me throw up almost immediately. I told her this, then kept walking and crashed on the couch.\n\nThe next couple of days I got bombarded with the group message of people telling me that I needed to pay for the rum and how I was basically outcasted from the group for taking it. I was drunk, but I NEVER drink rum it doesnt result in a fun night for me ever - I tried telling them this but no one believed me. They all said that someONE had seen me take it, now there was one bottle I was drinking from that EVERYONE said was gross and they didn't want it and it was a bottle of some weird flavoured vodka so I thought why not. My best theory is that the one who \"saw me take the rum\" was 'R' as he was sitting next to me when I took the vodka after everyone was complaining about it and I had brought other drinks that people were sharing. Either he was too drunk and assumed it was the Rum after hearing that went missing or I was used as a scapegoat now I'm not sure but either way I'm 60-70% sure it has to do with R, I have tried explaining over and over this WHOLE thing I have written here but B and R have been adamant and everyone else has jumped in hive mind. I feel I can no longer go to the group because of this, any advice?\n\nB and A were kind of the 'leaders' on one side when the group split and 'R' was kind of the 'leader' on the other side. But when all together B and A are the 'leaders' and M and I were starting to become sort of 'leaders' as well. M has remained neutral which is what id do but im quite disappointed as he and i had only recently met and starting to become good mates, and because of R's fuck up or someone using me as a scapegoat that has been ruined along with my integrity within the group. Also there is F who I had been kinda friends with on and off since primary school who sent me a big message reprimanding me about that night when he left before we actually got there even after I told him. \n\nMy theory is whoever took the money is who scapegoated me. Either that or R just fucked up or saw an opportunity and did it on purpose to outcast me from the group for whatever reason?\n\nAnd no, even if I was drunk there is still no way I'd ever touch rum even if there was nothing else left.\n\nAnyway, I'd like to go to the group again because new people show up all the time but I am worried that I'm just going to get shamed for something I didn't do and that me trying to make new friends at the group will become redundant.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I would prefer to steadily explore a book piece by piece, along the way as we read, with someone where we can have many topic strings flowing throughout.\n\n\nAnd ideally, this helps us become friends along the way, because books shouldn't be the only thing we talk about.\n\n\nAs potential drawbacks, I am an older guy (41) and married, and I understand how these things can make some people run away.

I know, not many interesting hobbies, but I have a reason to not pursue any other hobbies. Anyone with the same hobbies is guaranteed my constant attention, and great conversations.\n\nI'm looking for friends to talk to. Though I don't discriminate between genders, I'm mostly looking for girls to talk to (not for the reason you're thinking of). I seem to be a lot more open with girls that I am boys, and it helps a lot if I can have some female friends to let me vent, and even if they could give some advice to help me, that would be very appreciated. Again, I don't discriminate, so if you're a boy around my age that can hold a conversation well, I'm also willing to talk to you.\n\nI have issues though, which you need to be aware of. I have suffered loneliness for quite some time, and this has developed a lot of mood swings and anxiety. I am very paranoid about conversations and people disappearing for a hour or so, so if you're one of those people that aren't very active on social media or usually go silent for a few hours, I'm not really the one for you, I'm sorry. I despise ghosting, so if you're someone who ghosts, stop reading and go somewhere else, and save me the effort with having to deal with my issues.\n\nWhen looking for a personality, the least I could ask for is someone who is kind, caring, and interested in any conversations we have.\n\nI also do not discriminate between race or sexuality, considering I'm very accepting of whichever you are.\n\nIf you are interested in talking, for whatever reason, please do send a PM, and we can talk more. If I like talking to you, we can share discord names (or which ever social media you prefer), and we can talk more there (considering I hate talking on Reddit sometimes). Tell me about yourself when PMing, please. I hope I find some good people out there.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Someone with an ideal they were willing to strive for; a part of themselves they held-firm for someone special. Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of option, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person. \n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers). \n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values). \n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

I'm only going to share two of the things that happened, as they're just things I'm thinking about right now. One thing that I noticed, was she had rearranged these two pictures I had on my side table. The other thing I only just noticed this morning for some reason. I had two pillows in the living room and I noticed one was missing. I went all over the place trying to find it and could not figure out where it could possibly be. Lo and behold, I find it is in the guest room amidst all the other decorative pillows. There is only one way that pillow could have possibly ended up there and it would be that she decided that it should go in that room instead of in the living room. When she comes to town, it's usually to see one of her children who lives here. Many times, she's been kicked out part way through her visit and has had to go and get an Airbnb. She never gives me any reason why she's been asked to leave her daughter's house. It sort of seems like she's never given a reason, but that just can't be. Anyhow, she really is a lovely person and so many ways, but she just tries to take over. There's a whole list of things that I could share, but as I've said, it just wanted to share those couple of things as they were on my mind right now.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

In public I sadly don't have many friends in person and most of my friends are on here from Reddit. They have been so awesome and nice and I can't thank them enough.  I was hoping I can make friends with more people like that. Don't worry about those I'm already talking with I will still talk with you. Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Big Little Lies, The Handmaid's Tale, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nOther things I like are to learn about history, conspiracy theories/mysteries even though I don't believe most of them, Memes, and Sports. \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03. If you going to message me I recommend you being around my age at least 19-27. I can make some exceptions though. \n\nImportant, don't bother sending me a message if your just going to ghost. It really hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Also I  don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again. It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have Whatsapp, kik, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now. Until we get to know each other more. I prefer the pm message box and not the chat but whatever works for you. So yeah just msg me your age, gender, and a little bit about yourself so I know you read all this lol.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Months later, I feel like I\u2019m the one that needs space. She constantly texts me even when she knows I\u2019m busy. Around October, I went to visit my sister and my niece and nephew for a week. I hadn\u2019t seen them since January. My friend got annoyed because I wasn\u2019t texting her during that trip. She knew where I was and who I was with. I wasn\u2019t gonna be glued to my phone when I\u2019m around family I haven\u2019t seen in a while. She did the same thing on Thanksgiving day. Texting silly stuff (\u201clook what I bought! Look what came in the mail! Should I buy this or that?\u201d) and getting mad I didn\u2019t reply within 20 minutes. I understand she doesn\u2019t have a big family, but I do. And I like to give them my attention considering I don\u2019t see them every week like I see her. She\u2019s inconsiderate and expects attention all the time. Anyway, I\u2019ve stopped talking to her because every time someone in our group of friends has an issue with her, she deflects and assumes zero accountability.

But when I got into a relationship she kinda started being a bit more personal, she'll tell me she misses me everyday, say she wants to spoil me and see me almost everyday. She'll tell me stuff like \"you're so cute.\" \"You behave so cutely.\" and she'll call me adorable constantly, say that she's jealous when I'm with my partner. She insists on hugging me at least 3 times before leaving and has even pushed her face against my chest. \n\nIt makes me extremely uncomfortable how she always kinda flirts with me and forces her way into being around her.

I only really come into contact with people through my job that are old enough to be my parents, which is fine, but I want friends I can hang out with and go do stuff with. Understandably, even though I happen to click much better with older people, they don't want to hang around with someone who is essentially a kid. I have a few friends from my old town who live over an hour away, but I'm beginning to grow apart from most of them as we're going different directions in life. Honestly, 24 is such a depressing age. \n\nQuitting my job or getting a second job is not an option for me. I'm in the process of taking over the family business and will not have time for a second job, and don't really have many options for a different one. I'm already dedicated to this business. Also, the fact that I'm in an authority position in my job means I really have to be careful about making friends that are customers or employees, as if something goes wrong I can quickly lose that friendship. \n\nI really don't want to go hang out at bars or meet online strangers. Those two things are just not my thing at all. As far as hobbies go, I have very limited time for hobbies at all, and the only thing I've really been that interested in is something that there's pretty much no community in my town for and have to travel over an hour to participate in. I do meet people through that, but since I only get to do it once a week as of now and likely even less in the future, I'm not very close to any of those people and we're just acquaintances. The bad thing is that I really don't have many interests and am unfortunately not the most confident. \n\nI've tried the Meetup app to see what kind of events or clubs/groups were around, but within an hour's driving distance is all dinner clubs for ages 40+, sports (I am not athletic at all, don't enjoy athletics at all, and would be laughed out of there for sure if I even tried it; besides, I actually want to be able to talk to and get to know people, something you can't really do if you're focusing on the sport the entire time) or some sort of trauma groups.\n\nI've tried to attend events with the friends I have and meet other people through them, but most of these events are not very social and I haven't really met many other people through my friends that I've clicked with. \n\nI would really like to meet people naturally, but that just isn't happening. I really want to avoid online, as I find that you don't really know for sure who is behind that online profile and it's harder to see if you actually click with them (and I really don't want people I know coming across a profile that basically broadcasts that I'm a lonely person with few friends), and there are really no online friend making sites that aren't really just dating sites, and I absolutely want nothing to do with dating.

It's important for me mostly, because I'm scared of getting married before knowing each other on this level. He gave a hint that then he might propose. If so we might get married the summer after that, then perhaps kids... So the plan with my friend will not happen - I can't afford two large trips one after another. If there will be a wedding, even more so. But without it too. And once I have kids it won't happen until they're old. I do really really really want to do that trek with her! I often fantasize about it! But life gets in the way...\n\nI know it's all pretty far into the future, but I'm terrified of telling her of my plan of two weeks vacation with my bf this summer - because I know she will understand right away that it means we might not do what we said anytime soon.

If there was a hobby that I would choose above any others, it would be music. When it comes to games, I mainly play PC. I do have a PS4 and a Switch, but I don't pay for their online services. So if you play on PC, I'm sure we'll find something to play together and talk on discord. I play both high spec and low spec games, so that shouldn't be a problem.\n* I like to consider myself a kind person to the people who are kind to me in return. I'm witty and attentive and I try to get along with everybody. I'm energetic, not necessarily 24/7 but I can crack jokes regardless.\n\nI could say more, but I think we should save that for when we get to talk.

And I haven\u2019t even seen him since the eighth grade. It all started when I first randomly messaged him out of boredom because he followed my out of nowhere.  Which then led to a month later admitting that he liked me in school despite me being rude to him apparently I looked better than most of the girls there and to him I got allthe attention for being \u2018pretty\u2019. I never knew people actually Found me pretty.   Then he asked who I liked and etc etc. and no it wasn\u2019t him. He\u2019s not very attractive so he can\u2019t get a girl right? \nI have overprotective family, kind of home all the time, and currently studying a \u2018course\u2019 that\u2019s mainly just girls and unemployed. So I have 0 male interaction like I did back in high school. They were all mean and fugly anyways. So messaging him is my only male interaction. And he gives me all the attention.\nAnyway he\u2019s super nice, and is trying to look out for me. Apparently he knows and has spoken to all these wild sex-crazed people and is trying to keep me safe. One of his weird friends once took him to help her buy Victoria secret lingerie. Despite all that he\u2019s a virgin, doesn\u2019t want to catch anything, and can\u2019t get a girlfriend.   When I first spoke to him I thought he was gay. Yet he kept saying he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s straight. I\u2019m still too scared to even hang out with him in person.  He wanted to be actual hang out friends he admitted when I first started talking to him and said just texting friends. The convo has gotten kinky in the past. we talk like pretend girlfriend and boyfriend everyday now. I don\u2019t even know how it happened. \nAnyway he\u2019s offended me over some things he\u2019s said and sent to me.  \nOne.  The time he sent me a pic of this woman topless on a table covering her tits and he commented \u201cBOOOOBS\u201d, then when I went off at him he goes \u201cshe\u2019s famous\u201d, and I\u2019m like I don\u2019t care. Famous for what?  An Instagram full of BOOOBS? I told him She looks like she wouldn\u2019t get along with me.  She really did. Apparently she\u2019s a YouTuber. Idk why but she made and still does make me so angry I blocked her, when her namecame up through someone else. Idk why she makes me so angry, all because of him \nAnother time he sent me the same bikini model twerking. And I commented something about white people taking black culture. And he goes \u201cshe\u2019s *ethnicity*!\u201d Which made me go she doesn\u2019t look full. And he\u2019s like oh she is not full. Looking back I would be very angry to have him follow this page. If not MANY half naked lady pages.  Another time after talking to him about buying a bikini just to sleep in - he sends me some girl taking a mirror selfie in lingerie. And this time I just left it on read. \nHe doesn\u2019t do this anymore. In fact he\u2019s told me he\u2019s unfollowed all these disgusting people, because he wants to be a better man. His feed is all food and friends.  I tell him okay, even though I don\u2019t believe him. I don\u2019t want to look through his feed and still see all these thing that make me angry and be all SEE? LIES \nSince he\u2019s so nice I\u2019m mean to him on purpose and threaten to leave him and he goes NOOOOOOOOOOO\nApparently I\u2019ve taken his heart. Yet he makes me sooo angry for the pettiest reasons. I don\u2019t know why.   Nor do I know how the attention I give him has gotten him so into me. I mean he once sent me a meme about Beyonc\u00e9 and her husband \u201csee? *celeb* is with an ugly guy. And she\u2019s happy\u201d \nShould I at least hang out with him in person just once?

Came back at 1 point in time. I'm currently doing my second attempt on my \"High-School degree(Abitur)\"for reasons you may ask me private, and I hate school. I'm happy its just this last year and then I'm done for.\n\nLike almost every other human, I like noise. Music of course dummy. My taste is.... Broad. If I had to choose 1 genre to listen to the rest of my life, it'll be Tropical House. I freaking love summer vibes, but also listening to Hardstyle, Metal, Heavymetal, EDM etc... Listing all of em would make this text longer than it already is goddamn it. When I got the money, I will get myself a Sax and learn to play that sht :D .\n\nFor gamers: I pretty much play a broad variety of games like Rainbow Six: Siege, Hell let loose, War Thunder, Monster Hunter World and many more. I'm a PC exclusive player and if you want to know what we could play together, I'll send you my Steam-ID. I occationally stream my game sessions and also have a YT-channel for \"highlights\". Since the release of Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC I quite played a lot of that. Also Command &amp; Conquer \n\nIt's hard to describe my own personality, since you never see yourself objectively as others do but I try. Since I have ADHD I am SUUUUPER talkative, sometimes even a little bit awkward, not gonna lie. I love to flirt for fun, sometimes even doing that with my male friends since I couldn't care less haha, for a lot of people charismatic I suppose (hence the reason I got a lot of my games from others in my library), a dog and wolf \"fanatic\" and I love to be in charge if I can handle the situation. I'm straight forward (heart on tongue kinda guy) so I usally tell whatever I think, being too honest. My humor is something most people don't get, and that's fine, we all different hoomans. I don't have a \"heavy\" german accent as most germans have. Just sometimes.\n\nSo now that I look super incredible and awesome (jokes on me), lets get to some negatives.Since ADHD has been and still is a huge part of my life, I tend to forget A LOOOOOT of things. Don't be upset if you tell me your whole life story and in 2 weeks I remember nothing until I got like 1 or 2 keywords that reactivate my grey cells. I am super terrible with dates so I usally don't bother with birthdays. I tilt very fast, and much so. Sometimes my humor is VERY INAPPROPRIATE. I struggle from time to time to understand when specific comments are okay and when not (if you get what I mean). Sometimes I can't handle multi-tasking since my brain just says \"No fam, not now\", so sometimes I doze off, and then be like \"Sorry what?, I wasn't paying attention\". I do have anxieties that we could talk about when we click, since hard past and terrible childhood. I tend to overthink a lot, so sometimes I understand things wrong and then be like \"Did he/she/them meant it this or that way, what is X suppose to mean\" and so on. Also I'm a stubborn fellow. the last thing, I love to be the center of attention.\n\nI try to be as active as I possibly can, even with people living in different time zones. It is always very interesting to talk about things you like, for me it may be Star Wars, Movies &amp; Series and for you it might be foreign politics, Disney or the universe. I \"suffer\" from ADHD, which sometimes leads to problems and for some people it's just an stupid excuse for not paying attention or being to hyperactive but everyone affected by this knows, it is real. To this day, I notice how much of a bummer it can be. Basically for me one of the big things is that I really struggle to finish what I start, especially when I'm not enjoying it, and holding back emotions. I am extremely emotional from time to time.\n\nOther than that, I really love to connect to others, get to know em, play games with em or whatever happens. Discord is a huge thing for me since I can call people all over the world and talk about all kinds of nonsense. I don't really have a specific clue what I'm searching for. So Yeah, sorry for all that text.\n\nTL;DRMarc, 21, German, having ADHD and all I wanna do is sociallize with all sorts of people, doin some chatting and get to know some plebs.\n\nIf you want to get to know me more than here already, or ask me more things, I am very happy to do so :) Just Dm me or comment, I don't know haha.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Anyway I just wanna know if I am in the wrong here. I have realized unfortunately that sometimes I talk about my best friends behind their back, not anything really bad or anything but sometimes not the best. One of my best friends I have known since 4th grade, but they are an only child and sometimes they don\u2019t think about others feelings when they do things. I always feel like I\u2019m trying to be closer to them but they don\u2019t return that closeness. Sometimes I vent to another friend about it. I really do love them and don\u2019t get me wrong I have had some really fun times with them and still do but other times it\u2019s not so good and I vent to other friends about it. Is it wrong to do this sometimes I feel guilty about it but idk. I guess one situation that sticks out in my mind was when we were both on a school related event at a football game, an older friend of theirs had a panic attack or something like that so they took him out and kind of just left me along for almost an hour. I get it though panic attacks suck and I know they just wanted to help them probably because they have a crush on them and are friends but they just left me to be alone for close to and hour and all I get is a text saying that they\u2019re okay now. I\u2019m probably wrong for saying this but I felt hurt I have been friends for so much longer than they have with this other person and they just left and didn\u2019t even say anything, in fact they weren\u2019t the ones who texted me someone else did. I never told them how much it hurt me though and ended up venting to a friend later, and coming back to school everything was normal so I didn\u2019t want to ruin a good day and didn\u2019t talk about it. I\u2019m sorry this is probably all over the place but if anyone has any advice on what I should do I would be very grateful.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She hasn\u2019t told her parents about him because of the possibility they might prevent her from seeing him. Because they don\u2019t know about him, every time she spends time with him which is weekends at a time due to long distance, she tells her parents she is with us. This means that we can\u2019t hang out as often because her parents would get suspicious as to why she is hanging out with us so much even though she\u2019d be with him half the time. This means that we barely ever hang out anymore. On top of this, whenever we do hang out, she makes it seem like it is a chore for her to hang out with us. Like she is not doing it for fun but purely to maintain our friendship. She will sometimes only want to hang out after a weekend of being with her bf so that her parents can see that we were together and think we were for the whole weekend. I have also noticed that she barely ever messages the group chat now and when she does, it is to talk about her bf. Ive met her bf multiple times and from what I see he treats her well and wouldn\u2019t be forcing her to neglect other relationships so I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be the one causing this. Another friend of mine agrees with me that she is clearly prioritising her boyfriend over us rather than balancing the relationships she has. We feel as though she doesn\u2019t even want to be our friend anymore due to her making it seem like our friendship is a chore. We understand that she could be in the honey moon period of the relationship which is why we haven\u2019t said anything to our friend about how we feel. It\u2019s getting to the point where it\u2019s frustrating and we feel unwanted.

My self esteem has fallen, Ive become really sensitive to almost anything that happens around me, and everything just hurts. I feel like I don\u2019t deserve anything that I have, including my friends. Everyone and everything is too good for me. Since before all this started, my friends have been with me and supported me. They witnessed this starting and tried to help me out. They even reported me to the school psychologist so that I would talk to someone. They told me that they would always be by my side and support me through all this. A few months later, this past September, I went to the doctor and found out that I have severe depression. I still go about every 3-4 weeks to get my weight checked and to talk to her, and am also seeing a therapist. But like, those aren\u2019t magic and still take time to work, so I still do continue to have some of these thoughts. I feel like no one wants me around, and accidentally let that slip to my best friend once. She told me that she is here for me and I don\u2019t have to be afraid to tell her anything. This was November. I told her that I didn\u2019t want to burden her with my problems, and didn\u2019t want her to feel obligated to help me. She said that she could handle it all and would tell me if at any point she thought that she couldn\u2019t. About 2 weeks ago, one of my other friends (who I\u2019m not really that close with) told me that I always victimize myself and have a bad attitude, and my friends want to distance themselves from me because of it. That hurt so bad, so I went to my best friend to ask her if it was the truth. She said that she did agree. We talked a bit more, and she told me that she never should have told me that I was her best friend, because I\u2019m not. It hurt so bad. Me, my best friend, my second closest friend, and the girl who had accused me all went out for lunch one day because they wanted to include me with them, since they know that I feel left out. But being there, it felt like I wasn\u2019t even there. The three of them talked and goofed around and I was just sitting to the side. I tried to involve myself, but it didn\u2019t work. Since then, my second closest friend ended our friendship because she said I was dragging her down. My best friend told me this morning that I have changed a lot these past few months and needs to stay away for her own well-being. I want them to be happy and healthy, but none of this makes sense to me. So much is changing, and even my friends are leaving me. It hurts so bad. They said they\u2019d stay and help me, but both of them are gone. It physically hurts my heart so bad and I just want this feeling gone. What do I do? Why did they do this?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

And this is mostly a rant, but I would really appreciate advice too.\n\nI made a friend during spring semester last year. I developed a crush on them and asked them to coffee, which they said yes to and we had a good time. Then I asked them to go to a museum with me, which also went well. Then, they asked me to coffee again and came out to me as trans*(MtF). I will call her Aidy.\n\nAidy is just starting her transition. I kept my feelings to myself all summer because I understood my role couldn't be anything more than \"friend\" for right now. By the time school rolled round again, she had a wider support net and the pressure to keep quiet was off and I had to deal with my feelings. But having that secret made it hard to be her friend. So I told her and said \"this is how I've felt. I understand it isn't possible. I would rather keep you as a friend than not at all.\" And she received the information well and we have remained close, honest, and open with each other. \n\nI have two other friends that I am very close with. They are supportive and kind and honest and all those things. Aidy and I had a moment following a death in my family where she said something insensitive. I responded angrily. Then we talked, took some time to breathe, came back, and have been good since. The crux of my issue in that moment was Aidy didn't understand how to apologize without making it about her. She demonstrated selfishness which I'd only before seen in her when dealing with her transition. My other friends noted this and advised me to be careful, so I have pulled back a lot. Aidy and I are good now.\n\nSince this happened, one of my friends (let's call her Grace) has told me she doesn't feel the friendship with Aidy will last past school. She feels there is too much drama. My other friend (Lottie) agrees. I have a traumatic past which means I seek relationships with selfish people, mirroring what I was used to growing up. Grace and Lottie are concerned over the selfishness Aidy exhibits for this reason. But I see Aidy putting forth effort to adjust her behaviors and perspective and she has been a great friend to me since the issue following the death. I have seen concrete changes in how we interact and speak in a more healthy, equally supportive way. When I tell Grace and Lottie this they give me that \"yeah, sure\" look.\n\nI'm doing my best to protect myself and maintain boundaries because I know I need to. I value my friendship with Aidy and want her to be in my life after school ends, and so does she. I just can't get what Lottie and Grace have said out of my head and it's making me anxious. I know that they just want the best for me. Are Lottie  and Grace out of line in telling me my friendship won't be around for much longer?

After a while, I was barely friends with them so I took them off my private insta because it is kinda like my diary and I only wanted close friends on there.

When we do meet up, it's great and we have a good time.  However, she says often she's too busy to schedule things to do, and lately she's canceled several planned things because she's too busy.  But then we'll chat like everything is ok.  When I found out I was pregnant with my second she seemed really happy for me, even did a little gender reveal.  Her actions, besides being so busy, suggest we're good friends.  My husband works nights so it's really just me and my daughter most of the time, and she's perfectly happy hanging out with me having to drag my toddler along.  She has even suggested kids activities to do with my daughter together.  It means the world to me.  I also give her kids rides places and help get them to and from sports and all that. She treats my daughter so well, babysits on occasion, and her mom also babysits for me sometimes and treats her like her own granddaughter.  Friend and her mom live almost next door to each other and are very close.  A mutual acquaintance actually approached me during the summer, apparently she'd told her all about me, but also shared that this friend is very shy and doesn't really have any friends.  Apparently she talks about me all the time to her mom too.  \n\nShe's got 50/50 custody of her children, so I'd never ask her to do something when she has her kids, unless it were some big family outing (i.e. we did the pumpkin patch with all the kids together).  \n\nI've got my own anxiety issues to deal with, admittedly, and the pregnancy has made them way worse.  She will truly be busy Jan-March as that's the busy season for her work, so I know then that she's truly busy.  But the rest of the time?  She lives alone when she doesn't have the kids and I just can't figure out how she can be that busy.  I can't figure out if it's my anxiety in my way, her own shyness/possible anxiety as well, if I need to take the hint, or if she's a flake.  \n\nI know I should talk to her but I just value her friendship so much and don't want to scare her off.

I'm not having a psychotic break or anything. I'm not in danger of hurting myself or anything. I am, however, incredibly stressed, depressed, angry, and experiencing a lot of unsettling intrusive thoughts. I don't have anyone to talk to about it. I'm virtually alone in the world. That's probably my fault, because I sometimes avoid socializing in order to avoid arguments (I get into a lot of arguments with those close to me, probably because I grew up around abusive and argumentative adults). But the longer I am alone, the worse my intrusive thoughts gets and the more unstable I become mentally.\n\nAll these arguments I've been getting into with my friends (if I have any friends) reminds me of this guy I knew in Elementary school. We will call him M. M and I were inseperable. We were the best of friends, but we fought constantly. Again, I can't help but believe that it goes back to my abusive childhood. I didn't know how to properly socialize with people. All I learned was that those in close relationships fight all the time. That was true love: fighting. That's of course totally baloney, but that has to be part of the reason why socializing is so painful for me. I unconsciously fight with those closest to me because that's what I was taught. And on top of all that, I have Depression, Anxiety, and Autism.\n\nM moved to France many years ago. We occassionally emailed back and forth, but I have heard from him in a long time.

We have both recently moved to a different country and came from the same background so we instantly hit it off. She was very kind, rational and down to earth and it seemed like it worked really well because I'm a bit on the crazy side. She has really helped me when I went through a tough break up, she dragged me home one time when I got crazy drunk, we would go out to parties or just hang out at home and it was nice.\n\nThen she met a guy. I was instantly happy for her because he seemed like a nice person, but for the first few months of their relationship, she was often sad and crying because he didn't want to be exclusive, she felt ignored and sad. I really disliked him for this behaviour and me and her talked about it a lot, I comforted her, I even confronted him about it once because I didn't like how he treated my friend.\n\nEventually, they became a proper couple and things seemed to get a lot better. She finally got a proper job here, I got accepted into university and we both seemed to be on good paths. She found herself without a place to live so I helped her get an apartment, then I got a proper student apartment and we decided that we'll move in together because her boyfriend wasn't ready to move in with her yet. Naturally, the contract and utilities are all written on my name.\n\nThings started to go downhill before we moved though, the three of us went on this wedding trip together, I shared a hotel with them and I slowly started to realize that they were very tough to be around. Their modes are either lovey dovey or arguing, the arguments usually started by her her whining and complaining. I don't know how I never noticed that before, but as we hung out in the city, it was always too warm or too cold or too far or she was too hungry or he just didn't do something that she required. One evening I snapped and told her I can't deal with the way she's acting, but I apologised because I was a bit unsure whether it's really happening or if it's just in my head.\n\nWe had a bit of a break from each other before moving in, we ended up in an argument about who's taking the bigger room and after a while, I volunteered to pay half the rent and utilities for taking it. I'm not really sure why I did that, because I basically live off of my student loan, but I just needed to solve the crisis.\n\nThe first few days were nice, we did things together, but as time went by, she started disappearing more and more to hang out at her boyfriends place. I started to feel this tension between us, my school usually ended before her work and sometimes we'd have study days so I'm home quite a lot, which I told her I would. She would come home and not say much, looking at me sort of judgementally for lying on the couch or being in my home clothes. I still thought I'm maybe oversensitive because I do tend to be that, but fact was that we started communicating less and less, eventually just resourcing to basic polite phrases about work. She stopped sharing everything about her friends and relationship, sometimes they hang out here which is somewhat more tolerable than when she's alone, because she's not as irritated as when it's just me.\n\nShe finally snapped a few weeks ago, we had no cleaning schedule and in all honesty, neither of us really cleaned. I woke up one morning and her and the boyfriend were cleaning the whole apartment. I wasn't feeling up to the task them, because it came all out of the blue, but later went in to the kitchen to thank her, which is when she started passive agressively lecturing me about sorting the garbage and something or other that I did and was disgusting. I almost started crying, but then I decided I can't just leave it like that and told her to please tell me these things in a normal tone of voice and not immediately starting shit up. I later on offered to make a cleaning schedule to avoid these situations and she just told me \"yeah we can do that\", turned around and left.\n\nSo after that things were kind of normal again, until I said I can't pay my huge amount of rent which went up insanely with the arrival of cold weather. I said I'm going to have to find one more roommate, unless she wants to pay more. She didn't want to pay more and has before expressed that she doesn't want a third person to be living here, but agreed to it. Recently she's been asking me about why I'm not working and just lazying around at home, I do have two part time jobs but am very dependent on their regular staff getting sick so that I can hop in and work. There has been very little possibility to work, but she had a bunch of ideas for different jobs I could apply for.\n\n Now, I am quite lazy, absolutely no discussion about that, but I have been dealing with some issues my whole life, those of anxiety, depression, eating disorders and an alcohol problem, but I've kept it in check a lot recently. I still party but I don't do it more than once a week, which is pretty much what she does too, I never have people partying here and I brought a guy home maybe three times during this half year. Every time I tried to bring up my issues or wanted to share, she is suddenly uncomfortable, looking away or just making weird faces. So I stopped.\n\nThings were going ok, sometimes I would hear her be mean to her boyfriend and I started avoiding the common area of our place, I usually just retreat to my room when I know she's coming back from work. We do still talk, but minimally.\n\nWe were both at the same gig yesterday, our mutual friends asked me whether I've found someone for the apartment and I replied that maybe, but nothing is really sure because she doesn't even know if she's moving to the city yet. My roommate then started yelling at me in front of our mutual friend, telling me that she wants to be informed of everything and why did I not tell her, she also didn't forget to say that she doesn't want another person living here and became just completely furious. I just sat there, shaking. \n\nShe was basically ignoring me for the rest of the evening, making an annoyed face whenever I said anything to anyone and snapping at me one more time for something irrelevant. Eventually, at the end of the night, I left the group and confessed everything that's been happening to her boyfriends friend, that I now feel kinda sorry for, because he got the whole me crying and not knowing what to do monologue. He seemed to not understand why the two of them are together, said they feel toxic. Now, he said this before I cried, that's kind of what started it off.\n\nNow, I'm not sure what to do. I know we should have a talk but I'm actually scared of her and not sure whether I can find it within myself to initiate it. Any advice?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We  lived in different states but I moved to her city for college and we have spent a ton of time together in the past four years, tell each other everything, support each other, text all day, etc.  We were truly best friends. \n\n(tw suicide )\n\nThe past two years have been progressively harder and harder on my mental health. It got to the point this past September where I was barely functioning, thinking of taking my own life, feeling utterly hopeless and lost. My best friend has known about my struggles and been as supportive as she could be, but I have overall felt really alone/like I can't truly share what's going on with me. At the same time as shit really hit the fan for me, she got into her first long term relationship with this girl she met online. I was truly happy for her but honestly more preoccupied with trying to keep going/get out of bed every day. She didn't tell me a lot about their relationship bc I think she was too busy to talk with me/didn't want to bring it up if I wasn't functioning properly. I saw how happy she was with her gf/all the fun they were having together and I started to pull away a bit. I also tend to withdraw from everything when I feel depressed so I stopped answering texts/doing much of anything. (getting out of bed, showering, eating, etc) \n\nFor a while I was barely going on w/ life and the few times I mentioned it to my friend she didn't seem to get that I was having serious issues/seemed preoccupied with her relationship, so I stopped reaching out. We havent seen each other in months and really talked in as long. Occasionally one of us texts but I have only been truly functional recently and she doesn't seem interested in me/ask how I am. Luckily I seem to have weathered the storm and I no longer am going to take my own life. But now I am sad/hurt/upset with my friend and honestly, I dont know that I have a right to feel that way. She doesn't seem interested in seeing me/talking to me (even texting) nor has she expressed interest or concern for my mental health in a few months. I thought I communicated to her that things were serious and I really needed help, and that she understood my situation (cannot get help from my family), but maybe I was expecting too much from her. \n\nAll I know is I miss her and she doesnt seem to care/miss our friendship at all. I know she loves her new girlfriend but we've been friends for ten years and I really needed her. I feel like if our positions were reversed and she dropped off the face of the earth/stopped functioning I'd reach out more/be concerned for her safety. We've been friends for so long and went years talking all day every day, so things have changed drastically. But maybe it's my own fault and you cannot expect that much from your friends. I don't know what to do. I miss her and being her close friend but I feel hurt that she was so unconcerned/happy to let our friendship disappear. Am I being unfair? Should I reach out to her and express this even though it seems like she isn't upset we arent friends anymore? \n\nsorry if this is long af and poorly written. I'm a little upset.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We had a brief conversation, they said they wanted to meet and get coffee, then bailed, saying they forgave me but didn't want to be friends.

I was shocked but said hi and asked how they were doing, and they said good before heading out, and even patted me on the shoulder.\n\nThis was surprising because I assumed that friend didn't want to interact with me (and I've made it semi-clear that I miss them and would like to be friends again).

Background info: I'm a guy in college, in my early twenties.\n\nSo my question is do friendships have organic endpoints? This question is stemming from my current situation with two of my long-time friends. And I can entirely be in the wrong on some of this stuff, so feel free to give critical input. I'll separate by saying friend a and friend b. I've known them both since high school.  \n\n  \nSo Friend A has been a decent friend until recently, we've of course had our ups and downs. But we usually get it figured out. I don't want to bash him necessarily, but just to explain his situation. He is one of those people, that will argue until he's right or definitively proven wrong, he will rarely drop an argument. And many times when he is wrong, he'll just laugh it off, but if he's right he throws it in your face. He basically only talks to three people (including myself) outside of his family. He still lives with his parents, he didn't go to college after high school and hasn't kept a job for the majority of the time he's been out. He just recently got a job, and immediately started complaining about how he had no time to play video games or enjoy life since he got the job. I understand, like it's a hard shift, but literally any time we talked whether in the group chat with our mutual friend or just on whatever app we use he brought it up. Suffice to say, it was getting a bit annoying. So enter week 3 of him going to work, he suggests in the group chat that we all should take a friend's vacation. (Mostly because he is tired of work already...) So I and the other friend both agree let's do one. But then after he remembers we are both in college says we will need to do the friend vacation in summer. Which I immediately say no to, I work several summer camps through the summer and also still have work, I am actually usually more busy in the summer than through the year. But he argues with me about it for the rest of the day saying I should make the sacrifice for this \"once in a lifetime\" friendship trip. But finally, at the end of the day, he accepts I'm not going to go if they do it in the summer. But then stops talking about it. The reason why this is important is that he knows the summer camps are like the highlight of my year, which I express often and since then literally anytime we have talked it's just been an argument. We haven't hung out because he \"literally has no time\" because of his job. But any time he sent me any texts, they were polarizing texts against things that I like. Or any time I tell him about something he'll undercut it, and it'll cause an argument. So maybe I'm at fault for not like just letting the arguments/comments pass and move on. But on our last argument, he sent a long paragraph first explaining how I was wrong and had no idea what I was talking about (which maybe he was right), but then ended the text with \"why even bother arguing? everything I say you try to prove me wrong and I am sick of it. seriously it's getting annoying\". I responded (for better or for worse) to his argument addressing how he said I have no idea what I am talking about and then agreeing we should stop arguing. Because at least in my mind, if he wanted to just end arguing he could have just said that last part of \"why are we even arguing? there's no point.\" or something to that effect instead of insulting me and then putting that at the end. In my mind at least he is just passive-aggressively trying to get the last word. Since then we haven't spoken. It's never been this extreme before, but when we've disagreed in the past I am always the one that has to reach out and smooth things over. Which is just part of my personality, but this time I'm not really in any rush to do that. I was at the point where, when I saw a text come in from him I was literally like bummed out because I figured it'd be another argument and it was draining.   \n\n  \nFriend B and I have been best friends since my first (his second) year of high school.  His parents were really strict and had a bunch of rules growing up, which I understand more now as I become older as them just trying to protect their kid. But these last few months have been difficult for our friendship at least from my side. We went to different colleges in different states, so our communication is completely digital now. Which we have usually been pretty good about. I usually initiate phone calls and get other people to play video games with us (our main pastime). As far as I know, he has not made any friends in college and doesn't intend to. He's a bit of a recluse I guess. But this school year after summer has been rough. I'd call him like usual and he would only answer less than half the time, and then with texts unless we were on at night playing it started taking him until a few minutes before he got on to play to answer. So fast forward from the beginning of the semester to about halfway. A college near him was playing my college, and I suggested I and one of our mutual friends drive down there so we can hang out for a couple of days. He immediately started making excuses for why it couldn't work out and why it was impossible. But I get all of the logistics figured out and get money put aside to pay for gas and a hotel to stay in. So then we go into a group call and he says for us not to come. So, of course, I ask why? And he lists several excuses. He even lies and says he has a test due on Saturday, which I immediately call him on and he admits to lying. And I weave through his other excuses. Then says he didn't want us to come down for the weekend because he was tired and just wanted to sleep. Which honestly hurt me pretty bad, we haven't seen each other in person for over a year and a half. So for him to turn his nose up at the prospect of hanging out in favor of just getting a couple more hours of sleep upset me. Since then, I haven't called him as much and gotten on our game as much. When I do call him he either doesn't answer and send me a text saying he'll call back later or he's busy. Or he'll answer and just not pay attention to what I say. I used to talk through everything with him like he knew me probably the best out of anyone. But I tried to explain the friend A situation, and when I was done talking he had no idea what I'd been talking about. And I explained it three separate times.  (which I do rant sometimes, I understand that as you can see from how long this post is XD). But when someone asks for your opinion or emotional support three separate times, I feel like that usually is met with at least a few words on it.   \n\n  \nSo this just kind of leads to my overarching question of do friendships have an organic endpoint? Whether I am in the right or wrong in one or both of these situations, that's the question I have. I may not seem like it because of this post, but I am super loyal to my friends. I am one of those people that once we are friends, I will do anything I can to help you. I also super hate losing people. But these friendships are becoming one-sided and draining. And I understand sometimes that friendships have highs and lows for both people, but I am just wondering if some friendships are just meant to eventually end. Like is it time for me to let go here? Or am I just missing the point of friendship and getting too mixed up in my feelings to see that. Thank you for reading all this and for your eventual feedback hopefully. \n\n  \n  TLDR: Do friendships eventually come to an end? Two of my good friends since high school's actions are making me think our friendship is in its final stages.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I would like to kindly give all of you lovely souls a small bit of backstory on myself if you don\u2019t mind - However, if you would simply like to skip to the end, then I will gladly add a TDLR:  \n\n-\u201c25F Seeking penpal, or online friend\u201d-\n____________________________________________\n\n      Hello, to you dear reader and thank you for your precious time - As previously stated my name is K and I am simply delighted to introduce myself to you.  I am a humble, though an admittedly odd woman of twenty-five years who has found herself to be in desperate need of a meaningful conversation - You see my social life has simply been lackluster after having been moved from the city to the quiet countrysides in hopes of a better life. \n\nI am sadly learning through my time here that the idea to move to my current locale was sordid at best and disastrous at worst. For many things have admittedly changed over these past  years and none seems to have been for the better. Of most concern would be the drastic changes I have found within myself, for I no longer feel like the happy and sociable woman I once was...\n\nI feel as if I went from being a vivid and wholesome woman of faith into a sobbing, and suicidal shell of who I once was - I have gone from a soul infatuated with all aspects of life, a lighthearted and tangible being filled with the hopeful yearnings of  things yet  to come...to a monstrous and vile entity cast aside, and long-forgotten by the heavens above...\n\nIn the vacant stead of vitality now lies a wretched, and loathsome beast. A gangly and twisted creature made whole by the ether of misery itself -  forced  to call out into the bleakest voids of despair, day after day. Helpless and ever-pleading for a sliver of salvation from the accursed hell of its own design....In my time of exile, prowling on gnarled limbs across this barren land I fear I have lost the very essence of myself - I fear my soul now lies as deadened as the winter crops - and that my heart lies cold and bitter, unbeating upon my chest... \n\nYet somehow against the odds in spite of the harrowing frost that lurks deep inside me clawing, empty, and cavernous similar to the beast I now become - I can still feel the embers of a fire a hot and black upon my skin. An ever-burning flame of resentment that ignites itself for the choices that have lead me to this desolate \u201chell-scape\u201d of unceasing torment - a flame that when examined for to closely to be comfortable feels almost human...A longing sense that lays still, frail, and wondrous like a wounded doe upon the frosted ground - This feeling when found never ceases to bolster me with the small often fleeting and Ill-fated hope, that perhaps my suffering has neared its end.\nyet instead lingers like the grief of a cherished love. \n\nInstead of the warm embrace of kinship and light, caught basking in the joyous highs of youthful disarray and feeling once more human than before - The feeling of hope suddenly falters and dissipates - rough and jagged to once more seep back into the marrow of my brittle bones and hide itself away. Ushering my fears to rear their ugly pulsing heads and once more drag me crying into the depths of this hollow life of mine. Shifting back in to the beast I have crafted for myself. My second skin of self-denial and misery.\n\nMy fears in this form as they have come to be known to me - are as simple and agonizing as an arrow to the knee. I fear with all that is left to reside in my tattered corpse that I will shall never again look upon my old self in the mirrors of my home, that I will continue to walk wayward in this unbearable damnation for eternity - that this isolation shall become my destiny and my downfall...\n\nAll that has become of my begotten soul shall be broken unto in such ways that time could never hope to heal.  That the lofty burden of woe shall never be lifted from my shoulders, or hefted by another in my lowest wake. That in fate it has been written by my hands or in the heavens above  that I shall be damned to wander this world alone until death becomes me....\n\nfor this is my penance, my chain and ball. My sentence for sins I have yet to know and thus shall be paid in the blood of my veins and the sweat of my brow....To those who find my letter. I give thee thanks for reading the words I have so lovingly spread before you. I wish ye well in the dark months ahead and may those who favor you keep you in comfort and good company. \n\nSincerely,  \n\u201cK\u201d\n____________________________________________\n\nTDLR 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO- \n\nNow that the \u201cdramatic ice-breaker is over\u201d ( don\u2019t know why it shifted into \u201cknock off little house on the prairie meets H.P. love craft\u201d  but let\u2019s ignore that. ) let\u2019s get to the heart of the issue: \n\nBasically I moved \u201doff-the-grid\u201d three and a half years ago, and In that time I have not seen, heard from, or talked to another living person in any shape or form.

I spent the entire weekend analyzing what happened and I still don\u2019t know how to go about this or if I should just drop it and move on.\n\nI have a friend, Ashley, who I met through mutual friends (Denise and Ana \\*they are sisters\\*) some years ago. I connected with her instantly because of her personality and overall, she was a person I could see myself letting into my life. I don\u2019t have many friends, really, and I\u2019m super selective. I just don\u2019t let anyone in my circle of trust.\n\nHer and I lost family members two years ago and it was easy to talk to her about it because nobody else knew what I was going through. I considered her a good friend. Granted, we don\u2019t have history together like our mutual friends do, but I still considered her important in my life and a person I looked up to and respected. Life got in the way and we didn\u2019t get to see each other as often as we\u2019d like. She has four children and I have one; not that it matters, but she is a stay-at-home mom, and I work full time. Yes, we are both busy. Every now and then we\u2019d send messages to check up on each other, but that was it. I liked her checking up on me and vice versa.\n\nEarlier in the year I noticed she deleted her Facebook. I was concerned for her, so I messaged her if everything was okay. I didn\u2019t receive any response. Days go by and I ask if I had done something wrong and to please reach out to me, but nothing. I left it alone. I was paranoid. Why was I being ghosted? Did I really do something wrong? I decided to move on and if she wanted to reach out to me she will. I still very much cared for her.\n\nThen a month ago she adds me on Facebook, out of the blue. I added her, then noticed her location said Texas. I thought, \u201creally, did she really move?\u201d. I messaged her. Sure enough she did move to Texas and never bothered to reach out to me about it. When I messaged her about this, she said it was all last minute and she didn\u2019t mean to keep me on the sidelines. I couldn\u2019t believe this, and I still can\u2019t. Why not just send a text message? I would have dropped everything to see her (I did tell her this bit too). I found out through Denise and Ana they they did know about her leaving and they got a chance to say goodbye.\n\nLast week Ashley texted me that she will be in town and that we can meet up. I told her I\u2019d love to see her. Friday comes and she sends a group message to me, our mutual friends Denise and Ana and says she is boarding and \u201ccan\u2019t wait to see all of us this weekend\u201d. We all reply with our safe travels and can\u2019t wait to see you messages.\n\nThe group chat went dead after that. Ashley didn\u2019t text us that she arrived or if we can meet her someplace, nothing. Naturally, I thought she was busy with family and I totally understood this. I kept my phone by me all weekend in case she was going to call or message me to hang out. Nothing. I even told my husband on Saturday that I wanted to reach out to Ashley because I\u2019m keeping my weekend open and didn\u2019t hear anything from her. My husband said not to, and that if Ashley wanted to reach out to me, she would. I said okay and left it that way.\n\nShe didn\u2019t message me all weekend.\n\nSunday morning, I was feeling very down and sad about all of this. I texted Ana and asked if she saw Ashley all weekend and she said yes. She said she met her at the airport. Then I proceeded to ask if Denise saw her, she said yes. I left the conversation there\u2026 all I said was okay and left it.\n\nI messaged Ashley right after and said \"Hey girl. I know you're super busy this weekend with your visit. I was waiting for you to give me details on Friday. I would have met up with you\". She didn\u2019t respond.\n\nAfter I sent that message, she texted the group chat (!!!!) that she created on Friday (me, Denise, Ana), and said \u201cSo sorry I didn\u2019t spend a lot of time with all of you. I\u2019ll be back, Happy Holidays\u201d. I didn\u2019t respond. I was just hurt, sad, confused, angry, etc.\n\nLater on in the day, she did respond to my message. She said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry! I sent my arrival details on Friday and thought you would reach out if you had time. I know you're always busy and didn\u2019t want to bother you\u201d.\n\nFirst of all, she didn\u2019t send any arrival details in the group message if that is what she is referring to. Next off, she left the state without even telling me a damn thing and she expected ME to reach out to HER to meet up this weekend? She is the one who left town! And I found out through Facebook!\n\nWhy did she start that group chat on Friday and then go dead? Then restart it up again on Sunday morning. I don\u2019t understand this.\n\nSimply put, I feel like I was duped. I feel like an idiot. Can anyone share their perspective? Was I wrong by not contacting her first about meeting up? If I\u2019m visiting friends then I feel it\u2019s my responsibility to communicate with them when and where we can meet, etc. If I left one of my friends high and dry without telling them I left the state, then I would reach out to that particular friend.\n\nSomeone please help and share their insight on this.

Here is the backstory.\n\nI (38m) have been friends with my buddy, we will call him Don (37m) since we were in high school.  We have a lot in common and he really is my best friend.  We've been through a lot together.  That being said, here is the problem.\n\nThere was a few years in our late 20's early 30's where we didn't see each other much.  I lived and hour away and was busy with work and my ex-gf.  During this time he (later admitted) that he started going to a lot of bars in his area and making a lot of friends.  This wouldn't be such a bad thing, except Don has created an entire \"persona\" that is like a fucking roleplaying character that he \"plays\" when he goes out.  It's fair to say that the entire town he lives in knows him as his persona, who among many other things that aren't true, is a former United States Marine with 2 tours to the middle east under his belt.  This shit is about as far from true as it gets.  Dude is a DnD nerd, Magic The Gathering playing comic guru.  It makes me uncomfortable because I'm so very not cool with stolen valor.\n\nThe kicker is that he has explained his whole \"persona\" to me and expects me to back it up when we are out in public.  We now live much closer to each other, as I moved for a new job, and so now I'm being introduced to all of these people who know Don as a totally different person (fake ass character).\n\nSome of the people he knows are ACTUAL former military who don't press him about his \"service\" because he has told them he \"doesn't like talking about it and just wants to move past it.\"\n\nMy problem I guess is that, he's my best friend and I love him to death...but dude I can't support this whole thing he is doing, let alone \"back him up.\"  I don't want to end a friendship of over 20 years, especially because he is himself when it's just us hanging out.  I need some advice on how to handle this.\n\nTL DR, My longtime friend has a whole different personality that is known as \"him\" to an entire town and expects me to go along with it, even though it means supporting him pretending to be a Marine.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I tried to be thorough.", "author": "MsHurricane", "self_text": "As this is a general problem I\u2019m having, I haven\u2019t posted ages so I hope that\u2019s not a dilemma.\nA few things I will let on before many of you proceed further into my querie: One, I\u2019m a lesbian. So if you don\u2019t want to read further I\u2019d understand, please don\u2019t attack or offend me unless I stated anything wrong or harmful or outright deserve it. Not because of my orientation. I come in peace and with respect so please act accordingly. Two, my situation could apply to the masses as well, not just lesbians etc. Three, making friends with men that aren\u2019t gay has been hard for me as most guys don\u2019t want platonic friendship with me. At least in my area. And the second they find out I\u2019m a lesbian it grows worse. And when straight female acquaintances find out I\u2019m a lesbian they run for the hills thinking I\u2019m automatically into them. Which makes no sense as do straight women or men want to sleep with anything that moves? Well neither do I. Either that or they get weirdly competitive and it\u2019s downright exhausting at this point. I don\u2019t find this \u201ccompetition\u201d thing fun I find it pathetic but to each their own. I came to ask because I\u2019m feeling a bit down about this. Anyways, here goes...\n\n\nAdding to the second question, should one avoid friendships with those that have very clingy girlfriends? Lately I\u2019ve been feeling down in the dumps as my best friend, also a lesbian, and I are having a hard time hanging out due to her very jealousy prone girlfriend. At one point we ended up having this awkward as fuck conversation about me and my friend stating that we\u2019re really, nowhere near interested in each other but the girlfriend acting in disbelief. Or getting into awkward PDA and possessive behaviors that at first I didn\u2019t find weird since a lot of people do the same thing (I don\u2019t, but then again I\u2019m not that type either. I\u2019m pretty clear and to the point so if we\u2019re not standing in the same \u201crespect\u201d we\u2019re likely just going to be a temporary thing) but now find it kinda cringe. My friend and I have been friends for the last five years. When I first came out she had been there for me when my world turned against me for a time. And I\u2019m one of those people that has absolutely no ignorance to their own feelings. If I had feelings or desire towards my friends or anyone they\u2019d KNOW. I\u2019ve no shame, filter and try to be honest to a fault. I try to be respectful of those with their couples or if they state their lack of interest because I get it. I mean come on we\u2019re human. I\u2019m not going to \u201cblock\u201d you for that. The way I see it if you don\u2019t want anything amorous I\u2019m open to friendship. I especially try to reassure that to those that are in a coupling since their partners are usually the ones that break it off. Even when I try to befriend them. I\u2019m not a home wrecker or want to be.   \n\nMy friend and said new girlfriend have sort of in an on-off thing now where my friend is feeling just as weird but...we still talk and hangout often but sometimes we plan activities that I learned her girlfriend might also like and try to include her and befriend her into but she ends up making it all awkwardly uncomfortable. And then when we don\u2019t invite her she gets mad. My old gang of friends started dispersing due to meeting lovers in far cities or states, and even though we hang out sometimes it\u2019s nowhere near the same as it was so now I\u2019m branching out and trying to make new friendships. But now it\u2019s all sorts of alienating and hard to make friends without meeting that \u201cwall\u201d from most of the couples. Even when I specifically imply that it\u2019s all platonic things would get awkward. What I\u2019m noticing is the air changes to tense and competitive. I hate it. Maybe because I\u2019m not one of those clingy, super possessive eyes like a hawk kind of person unless there\u2019s an actual child in the room. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care about a lover so much that we\u2019re our own people while also being a couple. If we\u2019re sure of what we have, and there\u2019s trust etc why the babysitting? Or did I miss the memo that only our lover could be and should be our everything? We can make friends with others that aren\u2019t our lovers right? Isn\u2019t that healthy for people? Is my opinion not normal? What could I do to make it better? Is it me? Seriously though, do we have a sort of \u201cmanual\u201d besides the obvious golden rules as lesbians? If so direct me because I\u2019m blind as a bat right now! \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23 *Also I know this is long, I was going for clear and thorough.

It doesn't matter what it is, be it love, friendship, or a discord community .\"Sic Parvis Magna\" - Greatness from small beginnings. This discord intends to stay smaller (think: 30-40 people) with an emphasis on building long lasting relationships with people who are not only like-minded, but share an interest in genuinely connecting over time. If you're just passing through, this discord won't be ideal for you. We cannot promise you will meet girls/guys here who you will click with if that's also what you're looking for. Hopefully you're somebody who wants to make real friends, eventually meet up, talk everyday, etc. all that stuff.\n\nThe current members of the discord are from another discord, we know each other very well. What does this mean for you? Well, it means not only do we have this type of experience, but we will also do our best to connect with you. This means if you're a shy type, we don't care. Extrovert? Great, you'll fit right in. Some of us play games, some do not, this is definitely not that type of discord. Since we're talking about creating connections with people, we do expect you to be not only real, honest, but we hope that you are willing to voice as well. Why? Real connections occur when real effort is put out. Text is great, and often times we can only text, but we want to get to know you. Talking over voice is a good way to do this, and I believe that it's the only way to get really close to somebody.\n\nThis discord is very small currently, you will be here at the beginning (and hopefully) for a long time. If you're looking for a very active discord, this is not that currently, though eventually it will be. If you're looking for good friends, chattin shit, banter and finding people long term to talk to, meet, etc, this is for you. Some things about the people in here: We banter, a lot. We make dark jokes, we typically don't view things as sacred bar certain topics, we definitely expect you not to bully people, and we expect you to put actual effort in to creating connections as it's the whole point of this discord. Ideally you are: Genuine, can banter, will not disappear (if we see a lack of effort we will simply remove you.), would like to voice, not an internet personality, etc.\n\nplease PM me if you're interested, thanks.\n\nnote- if you're dry and don't ever talk, you will probably just be removed -- your effort has to match others otherwise a friendship may never be formed.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Basically, in the past four weeks, a lot of shits going down. But where it all came to a head was last night. Last night, I (18F) was hanging out with my friends. We had not hung out in about a week for reasons I'll get into later. The friend that I'm closest to (We'll call him John) told me that everyone was going to see a comedy show at our school. After that, we ended up in our college's cafe waiting for my friend's dealers to come to give them weed. I stopped smoking a month ago because I just don't enjoy it, but I was planning on sitting with them while they smoked so I could hang out with them. I'd been pretty upset because I felt like they were distancing themselves from me, so I was excited. We had fun and played one-word stories while we waited and it was all going great and I was happy. After we got the weed, we stopped to say hi to some friends who were studying. During that time, two friends (who we'll call Sarah and Amy) disappeared. So, it was me, John, and two friends who we'll call Henry and Megan left. As we walked out of the cafe area, I inquired to where Sarah and Amy left. No one seemed to have an answer, but Megan muttered something about Sarah's room and then loudly said \"We're gonna go to our dorm building!\" and then she and Henry walked away (Sarah and Amy live in a different building then Henry and Megan). Then, it was me and John left. I figured at first that we were done for the night (there had been some talk of *maybe* not smoking the weed that night). However, John and I live in the same dorm building so I figured we'd walk back together. I waited for a moment as John seemed to be texting someone. Then, all of a sudden he got a phone call. He chatted for like 5 seconds and then hung up. He told me it was Lance (obviously giving you guys a fake name), someone who he was friends with who I'm not. He said he was going to hang out with him now. I say okay and let him leave, but I'm suspicious because the phone call sounded fake and they had been not inviting me to things recently. I don't get paranoid easily so I listened to my gut. I sat down instead of leaving, which is when I realized that John hadn't left, but was hiding and waiting for me to leave. I *saw* him. He hadn't left for where he said he was going, but just standing there alone in a spot where he thought I couldn't see him. I left because at this point I was pretty sure what was going on. Now, this next part I guess I could start seeming really bad, but keep in mind I'm not the type of person to let people get away with being dicks to me. I'm pretty upfront about my feelings. I leave for maybe two minutes to let him go where he needs to, and when I come back I'm just in time to see ALL of them walking and laughing and going to the \"smoking spot\" as we call it. I follow them there for no other reason than to confront them. That's why I followed them and no other reason. I wanted them to KNOW that I knew that they were purposefully ditching me and how I felt about it. I go over there, and I say \"That was a nice fake phone call, John.\" He replies, \"It wasn't. Plans change, OP.\" It is at that moment I realize that confronting them won't work, so I say \"You know what? This isn't worth it.\" And with that, I left. (IDK if this is relevant, but just for honesty I did see them again later that night because I lost my phone near the area, probably because I dropped it as I left, and I needed to get it. As I looked, they were done smoking and saw me and their high selves decided to help me decipher the find my iPhone map. It was civil but I clearly was still mad so nothing got discussed beyond a 5-minute conversation about my phone).\n\nThe next morning, I wake up to a text from Megan. She apologizes, says that what they did was bitchy and a mean girl thing to do. I reply that sometimes sorry isn't good enough, but then she replies to that by telling me WHY they did what they did. If I could relay the entire conversation to you I could, but it's really, really long following from there. The highlights:\n\n1. I haven't talked to many of them in weeks (She's referring to Amy specifically, more on this later).\n2. It seems like I'm just using them for smoking and alcohol.\n3. Megan's heard specifically that I hate her.\n\nNow, the last two points are what Megan and I discussed during our conversation. Basically, I have never said that I hated her. This is actually based on a night two weeks ago where Megan and Sarah confronted me on being \"messy\" when I was drunk. What they meant was one night in particular where I cried, because they'd only seen me under the influence 3 times (we've only known each other 3 months). I've never cried when I was drunk except that one time, and the reason I was crying is that I had had a particularly hard week (college transition and all) and was trying to hold it all and the alcohol made me finally be honest about how I was feeling. Also, they also said how they feel like I don't actually like them and how I'm so quiet when I'm hanging out with them and don't really engage, and how they think I don't actually like them. I obviously got annoyed at them, because they basically said they'd prefer if I didn't drink that night because I was too messy and that they think I don't like them. This made me upset, so I ended up texting my best friend from home (who agreed with me that I'm not messy, and she'd tell me if I was, trust me on that) and also John. I told him how I was feeling and how it made me upset that they don't think I'm responsible enough to handle myself, especially after I told them that it was a one-time thing, and I also told him about the quiet thing. I told them also how that made me upset and why I've been quiet lately and I thought that was it (I ended up only having a quarter of a Mike's because I felt self-conscious, so I was basically sober) However, later that night, Megan (drunk) all of a sudden yelled at me \"If you don't want to be my friend, then suck my dick\". Now THIS made me really angry. I knew it was because John had told Megan what I said, and I was right. Apparently, he had shown her the upset texts and it leads up to Megan thinking I hated her. We cleared this up, it's just not true, she's one of my favorite of the bunch. Now, to the real issue: Am I using them for alcohol and weed? \n\nSo, they thought I was just using them for alcohol and weed (Weed got quickly dismissed because I don't smoke anymore, I started it 2 weeks into college to see if I liked it and decided quickly I did not, so 2 months into college I quit entirely). In terms of alcohol, apparently I was very quiet when we hanging out and only got excited when alcohol got mentioned. At first, I was confused because I thought it wasn't true, but I very quickly realized why they thought this. See, I mentioned earlier that I had been upset that they hadn't invited me to things, so naturally, whenever I heard about events/hanging out I got excited because I could hang out with them. The thing is though... I only ever seemed to hear about events that included alcohol so when I got excited about hanging out with them, it seemed like I was excited about ALCOHOL. This simply isn't true, I wouldn't care if I could hang out with them regardless of alcohol. In terms of the quiet thing, I am naturally I quiet person but it gets more intense when I'm insecure, so I've been insecure about them not inviting me to things, so I've been quieter. I started getting insecure at first because everyone was so much closer and I wasn't sure how to get closer with them too. Then, my quietness probably got them to invite me to things less and it was a vicious cycle. I've been trying to work on this problem, but them using it to say I don't really like them is not true.\n\nNow, as I'm having this conversation with Megan, at the same time, I see John and Amy in person. They try to act like absolutely nothing happened the night before, being friendly and do not try to apologize. I tell Megan this in text because we're having a conversation as to what to do about all of this. She apparently texts them that I said this, which is fine, which opens up a text conversation with the two of them (separately).\n\nAmy's is still confusing for me because she texted ME first but then treated it like I texted her, but I'll summarize it for you.\n\nAmy: Hey. What did u want me to do today? Like u said you didn't like how I acted as if nothing happened. IDK what to do.\n\nMe: It just feels terrible to have something done to you and then the next day the same people are acting as if nothing is wrong. Megan is the only one who's apologized or acknowledged what happened so it makes me feel like none of you care.\n\nAmy: OP, You don't talk to me. And then when you're around me, you still don't talk to me. I don't know what you expect me to say, and I'm uncomfortable because what happened last night doesn't seem like something that happened between you and me. And we're not close anymore. So I didn't feel like I needed to say anything.\n\nMe: I get that. I'm sorry for not talking to you much but it was really just symptomatic of the whole situation. I am still upset about last night because I'm still not sure how last night went down 100 percent, but it definitely looked like an elaborate plan to ditch me, which is something you were still a part of. That's what I'm angry about on your end, I don't really have much issue with you besides last night. My issues are mostly with other people. But, last night was all of you.\n\nAmy: OP, Stop picking a fight with me. If this is how you feel, then please think about yourself. Maybe we don't vibe. But we can still be okay.\n\nMe: You texted me first? You asked what I needed so I told you. I wasn't picking a fight.\n\nFrom there, it ended pretty abruptly. She said she didn't like confrontation and when I said I wasn't trying to confront her, she stopped responding. I also said that blaming me for not speaking isn't truthful because she also didn't talk to me, but I did apologize for not holding up my end. I'm still confused about how I was picking a fight, so I included my whole text (made sure not to paraphrase it too much) that made her say that because I'm still not sure if something in there can be construed as me picking a fight.\n\nNow, we have two more to go. John and Sarah (Henry I haven't spoken to yet, I was going to, but Sarah and I's conversation made me want to stop trying).\n\nJohn texted me first to apologize. I responded similarly to Megan, saying it can't just be fixed with an apology. John and I's conversation went the best out of everyone. He agreed with Megan that it came across as me using them for alcohol, I gave him the same response I did above. We agreed that the main issue clearly was communication. Apparently he said last night was my fault because I didn't explicitly say I wasn't going to smoke (I have mentioned to him that I stopped smoking, but that was a month ago so he must've forgotten, can't blame him for that I guess). I told him that I didn't think I needed to say it because I didn't know that they thought I was using them, I'm not a mind reader.\n\nThen, he says that we should just focus on moving on and when I say I agree but am afraid that others in the group might not be on the same page, he tells me to text people to explain. I do; starting with Sarah, someone I haven't texted yet. Now... Sarah is a doozy. I don't want to even attempt to paraphrase hers and for the sake of honesty, I think I'm gonna send the entirety of our convo. It's the main reason I need advice. It also gives you insight into my friend's perspective, which I'm not sure I've done a great job of giving. By the way, you'll see that I texted John. I texted him to say that because we were having a conversation about making sure everyone knew that I wasn't using them and was on the same page, which is why I texted Sarah in the first place. When Sarah responded poorly, I texted John because I wanted to let him know that everyone was NOT on the same page. Here's the link to the images of my texts with Sarah: [https://imgur.com/a/6KEDIpl](https://imgur.com/a/6KEDIpl)\n\nWhat should I do? I'm so conflicted and confused. If you have any additional clarifications please ask them; I want to get good advice that makes sense with the situation! Thanks in advance.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm fine with that and I'm super happy that he's found someone he really connects with. It's just that all we have talked about is her since they started talking and he's shutting me out. I realize this is common that friends are paid less attention to when romance is involved, but some of his actions were unnecessarily rude. We usually talk whenever we have time but he barely said anything to me the whole weekend. We were planning to facetime on Sunday (day 2) but he blew me off to talk to her and face timed with her. After dinner I texted him like hey whatcha doing and he replied an hour later with \"just finished facetiming with her, waiting for her to finish showering now\" which kind of stung because it meant he was ignoring me. That same night he told me that he didn't want to talk to me that night so I was like ok sure, but then an hour later he texted me asking for advice on their conversation. She's such an amazing person from what I can tell and so is he and they really are great for each other despite only knowing each other online for a couple of days I can see that he really feels something for her. Then he told me that we should \"take a break from each other\" like he was platonically friendship-breaking up with me?? I really didn't and don't want to fight with him so I agreed and sent a text a bit later saying good night. He didn't read it, but he was active on insta the entire time and the next day I saw he read the text at 1 in the morning. I know him, and he was obviously texting/facetiming her and ignored me until he was done. I walked by him the next day and he was super cheerful and happy said hi acted like nothing had happened but we didn't have time to talk then. Later I gave him his christmas present early but he needed to be somewhere so we didn't have time to talk. So that night he texted me saying thanks blah blah blah and I still wasn't quite sure what he meant by \"take a break\" so I asked him specifically what he meant and he said he had changed his mind and wanted to make the most of our time together since he is probably going to move next year or the year after. That really reassured me because since he had suggested we take a break and had started ignoring me, I'd been doubting myself. So we talked about the gift I gave him for a bit, and he said he was about to facetime her so I ended the conversation because I knew if I tried to continue it he wouldn't respond. A little over an hour later I texted him asking how it was going and no response. He was still facetiming her. A couple more hours passed and still no response. I really need advice on what to do moving forward. My friends have been telling me I'm acting like a crazy gf and need to chill out and also that guys are just that way but it'll go away and he'll come back to me. Should I wait it out and see if this will diminish over time and he'll talk to me again? Should I talk to him about it?\n\nTL;DR: I am a girl with a guy best friend who is in love and as a result is pushing me away. I am doubting myself and my value in the world and need advice on what to do, because doing nothing and just moping will only make me feel worse.

I\u2019m a 25 year old mother to two little boys, I already have so much going on with that and we\u2019re shifting in to a new home! My friend is single and works. Maybe we\u2019re just in different points in life and can\u2019t understand each other\u2019s situation. Any advice?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Please I need your honest opinion and advice!!!", "author": "h2Opumpkin_", "self_text": "I have been in a friendship for the past 6 years, and a lot of things have changed. \n\nFor 4 years (while in high school) things were fine, we were best friends and we were good classmates. \n\nAfter high school (these past 2 years) we\u2019ve been college roommates. I thought it was gonna be a great match, since we\u2019re both clean, quiet and nerdy. \n\nBut here are some of the issues I\u2019ve reflected on...\n- our first \u201ctension\u201d : it was around thanksgiving time, we carpool back home all the time bc I had a car and she didn\u2019t. I was having issues at home and I wanted to postpone going back for thanksgiving (so that I spent less days home) but she didn\u2019t. She got a bus ticket home, but she didn\u2019t tell me. I ended up leaving before she did on the same day. It felt odd and tense tbh\n- when I began dating: I told her that I liked this guy and I was so excited to date bc this would be my first ever relationship. She started to talk about how love isn\u2019t real, people who date are stupid, and losing your virginity is for fools, etc... she was extremely pessimistic and it made me feel weird about dating... every time I would bring up going on a date or whatever she\u2019d either be rude about it (more negative stuff) or say stuff like \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d... dude, we were best friends... it got to a point where I asked her if she liked my partner and she said no... but she still follows my ex to this day, which is weird but alright I guess (since she comforted me after I broke up with him)\n- my other roommates and I were gonna go eat dinner with my partner at the time and his friends... my friend (who this post is about) was super against going to dinner, but at the last minute she invited herself \n- for the rest of the year, I dealt with her pessimistic and negative attitude and very very dry humor... she\u2019d mock me for being depressed and stuff and I whenever I would try to open up/vent/rant she would say \u201csame, join the club\u201d (even if it was about me wanting to kill myself, it seemed like she\u2019d promote/advocate it) which would make me shut down. I couldn\u2019t share what was going on \n\nThat summer after college, I changed a lot (like personal growth) and I realized that I\u2019m not a bitter, bad person... like I\u2019m really not. I\u2019m just hurt and I need to work thru things but I cannot invite negativity to my life. I realized that our friendship was actually making me feel worse, since I would come back to the dorm at the end of the day (tired, stressed and overwhelmed by college) to only have the gloom amplified by her attitude and stuff \n\nI didn\u2019t know where to put this but I\u2019ll put it here: I\u2019ve struggled with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts a lot in my life. I thought that she was a friend who understood me, but I later realized she didn\u2019t. For instance, when I was at my lows, I would try to talk to her bc venting makes me feel better. If I mentioned stuff like suicide, she would laugh or endorse it in a sense... for instance the whole \u201cjoin the club\u201d comments. Also, I was struggling academically and she would say stuff like \u201coh well, no one is gonna help you\u201d \u201cno one cares, what\u2019s the point in trying\u201d... stuff like that, it made the situation worse (at least for me mentally, I needed some positivity but all I got was negativity) \n\nAlso, my friend is really really smart. She would cry over getting a 95 instead of a 100, and would constantly complain about small stuff (like getting a B instead of an A) while I was there actually failing... her comments of \u201closer\u201d that were directed at herself kinda rubbed off on me, bc I felt like the epitome of a loser compared to her \n\nI tried to bring this up to her, like how she should not talk like that in front of me since it affects me, but she didn\u2019t change... she just rolled her eyes and acted like nothing happened \n\nSo let\u2019s get into this past year:\n\n*At the beginning of the semester* I told her that I can\u2019t sign the lease with her next year bc my parents want me to live with some relatives (it\u2019s a lie, I said this instead of saying she was toxic)\n\n- after realizing the \u201ctoxicity\u201d of the friendship over the summer and panicking over how I already leased with her for another year... of course I was anxious and kinda dreading things \n- I started to spend less time with her for my own well-being... I now know that I can\u2019t be around that kind of attitude 24/7, but I can never rest... I\u2019m constantly in libraries or cafes during the day and I can never go to by bed bc she\u2019s in the room (24/7 laying on her bed)\n- whenever I go into the room, she grunts and sighs like I\u2019m annoying her by my presence \n- she\u2019s never ok with me opening the blinds, and when I do, she grunts and sighs and shifts her weight on her bed, pulling her blanket over her head \n- I never have the space for myself... in the sense of privacy, I feel like I\u2019m paying her to live here, like she\u2019s allowed to do this to me \n- she doesn\u2019t throw away the trash, she lets it pile up... one time, I put on gloves to throw away the trash, but she grabbed the trash bag and threw it out... I felt shitty of course. I asked her \u201cwhy did you do that? I was gonna throw it out?\u201d She responded \u201ctoo late now\u201d, went into our room and shut the door \n- also, every time I try to socialize with people, like going to events or clubs at night, she always makes comments like \u201csomeone\u2019s gonna rape you\u201d, \u201cwhy would you hang out and waste your time with these people\u201d, \u201cwell, whatever\u201d shit like that fucking hurts, heightens my anxiety and makes me relive some of the bad things that have happened in my life \n- when I go out to get groceries, I ask her if she wants to go with me and she says no every time, and insists that \u201cyou won\u2019t find any food at the grocery store\u201d... if I buy stuff online or consider it (I have a to-do list on the wall) she says stuff like \u201cit\u2019s not gonna come\u201d, \u201cyoure wasting money\u201d, etc... \n- if I get food delivery she says stuff like \u201cit\u2019s gonna taste bad\u201d, \u201cyou don\u2019t know if they put stuff in it\u201d, \u201cdo you even trust these people?\u201d \n- As soon as I get back from a long day, she goes into the shower automatically (which is unfair, since she had the whole day to shower, not when I got back) \n- Now, whenever I leave/come back, I say hi/bye she doesn\u2019t respond, or if she does, it\u2019s a mumble and she stares at her phone under her blankets... if I tell her hi/bye she doesn\u2019t respond... if I say stuff like \u201chave a good day! Or good luck on the test!\u201d She says something negative like \u201cI won\u2019t\u201d or \u201cNope\u201d... it\u2019s a bit rude and it makes me feel like shit \n- when her family visits, she doesn\u2019t tel me... she just packs her bag for the weekend and leaves... if I text her panicking \u201cwhere are you? Are you ok?\u201d She doesn\u2019t reply at all, and I see her come back Sunday night... \n- she talks to her family outside the room in the common area, and she whispers pretty aggressively, if I come out of the room she instantly stops talking \n\nPLEASE PLEASE let me know what I can do... I have to live with her for 4 more months\nMost of the time, I\u2019m outside the dorm, I spend a lot of time out and I come back and still experience this \n\nP.S.

I've found some nice people on Penpals ad R4R - friends, even :) - and I thought it'd be interesting to see how this subreddit would compare. I have made this post before, on those two other subreddits, but hey, it's a huge novel, not a mere paragraph, so please forgive my copy-pasting, and I hope you like reading! I think it's a nicely positive story, so if you need a ray of happiness in your life, a smile on your face or an opportunity to stand up and go out there, maybe there's something for you in it - and if you don't, awesome, keep that smile shining brightly and find new stories in the world to explore!\n\nI'm 24 years old, from the Netherlands, and I live near Rotterdam, in an isolated-ish village. I was always just sitting there, going through the motions of life, with the many international acquaintances-friends-people I had online (and offline, but those mainly from my Master, which was international). Until, at the beginning of my Master, I realised I wanted to experience more, and to have more close physical friendships. So I became much more social in the physical world, I became much more expressive, I met up with people, went to events, befriended friends of friends, explored some cities while I was there anyway... Small things, but very nice things. There's a deeper reason behind this - it wouldn't be a good growth-story without a deeper trigger :) - but suffice to say, the dreams 'we' had built, didn't seem to be possible for 'us', so instead of pining for lost dreams, I thought I'd go do them on my own now, finding my own paths to do all these things, and not just stay in front of this PC forever.\n\nAround Christmas, I asked a Russian friend of mine whether she felt like going on a holiday together in the summer. I had known her for nine years, but we had never met up before. And so we found ourselves in Hungary, in August, where we cycled around Lake Balaton, climbed up mountains and climbed down into a cave with venomous spiders and bats, got lost in a boar-hunting-field-forest-place, exhausted from the burning sun and without water, drinking from natural water sources, eating fruits from farms, climbing down a small cliff to go swimming... It was such an amazing adventure! Wild, slightly dangerous, exhausting, I had never done anything like this before, it was awesome! We spent the final few days in Budapest, with the fireworks of Saint Stephan's Day, a lot of blisters, and one of the tastiest dishes I have ever eaten, that was hiding in a random fast-food joint that I didn't even want to go to. I like how such nice things - stories, encounters, experiences - can be hidden away in easily overlooked corners of the world. There's this young curious child, staring in wonder at the world, noticing all the little things we blindly walk by - I try to notice them as well, appreciating all the small moments and memories of life, the little patches of nature, the beautiful horizons... I think it'd be great to find a little more of that child inside ourselves. It makes the world so much more vivid, memorable, beautiful. :)\n\nBefore going to Hungary, I saw an ad about an organisation looking for students to go sailing and help make the world a more sustainable place. Well, if I want to experience more, I should apply to that, not? So I did, I uploaded a motivation video, I passed a selection weekend (the atmosphere there was amazing), and eventually I found myself on a month-long sailing trip from Amsterdam to Tenerife. It felt like a new family from the very first day, and it was so absolutely fantastic, I could talk for hours about this. The stars were beautiful, violin music spreading out over a tranquil sea on a calm and quiet night was wonderful, but the most beautiful sight I have ever seen were the dolphins and fish, at night, as we sailed through fluorescent algae. The dolphins looked like magical balls of white light, hunting fish that scattered like white firework in the water, it was so indescribably beautiful, and you won't find anything resembling this beauty online. It's really something for the memories. And there are so many more stories to be remembered. We shot at ships with a potato cannon, I almost lost two fingers - but fortunately Special Agent Sharona saved me, allowing us to successfully extract tasty toast from the prison it was kept in - and in general we had awesome times in the ports we visited. Everything was truly brilliant. In March, a documentary about this whole adventure went into premiere, at an event at the Nautical Museum in Amsterdam, and it was a beautiful and emotional time. I missed it, the sailing, the socialness, the closeness, the family. It was a beautiful trip in all ways. :)\n\nWe still have meet-ups, and I've gone sailing sometime afterwards, and I'll most likely do so again - who knows what the future holds! The friend I went to Hungary with asked me if I felt like going to Italy last summer, and within half a week (we had to wait for the weekend :P) and two and a half hours, we had mapped out a journey to take us through half of Italy in a week's time. It's nice, how fast we could set up an adventure - and it was a wild (and slightly dangerous) adventure, again, full of beautiful sights and intense experiences. Platforming through a canyon, climbing and swimming in rapid currents and with burning-hot rocks, reaching the top of a mountain after our bicycles broke down multiple times, darting from shadow to shadow and resting every ten metres because of sunstrokes and a lack of water, only to hear from a Frenchman living there that we couldn't complete this quest, needing to turn back after having endured so much - it was awesome! As for next summer, well, there are enough friends with enough plans, and if not, we can always go on a holiday together, dear reader. :)\n\nSo, travelling, socialising, new experiences! I now work as a sort-of-data-analyst, since a bit more than a year, directly after the sailing adventure. I'm quite grateful for the past years, with the people I have met, and with how much I have 'grown'. Completely ignoring a 'comfort zone' and just doing things. I definitely want to travel more, and I definitely want to experience more.\n\nI am endlessly curious, always wanting to learn more; I'm the only one who engages my sister in her biology knowledge, while I dropped that subject the moment I could, but I like hearing about people's passions, and I like to know, well, everything. I'm a walking Wikipedia about anything - this was in a letter I received during the documentary meet-up, letters that we all wrote to each other on the last day of the sailing - but if I have to give a bunch of subjects I am particularly interested in... History (I love all the stories!), politics, philosophy, psychology, science, things... Language deserves a mention as well; I can read Greek, Cyrillic, and Arabic (though the last one takes some effort) and I like being able to (fail horribly and have a lot of fun) speak the languages of my friends. I don't think shared interests matter much though; it's nice to hold a deeper discussion about something, but it's also nice to learn something completely new. :)\n\nI like creativity in general, and I have written some things (stories, poems, things). At some point, I realised that 'worldbuilding' is a theme in my life. From how a young me drew my own levels of platformer games (like Rayman, I love the vibrant colours, and nostalgia :P), or wrote documents of my own GTA missions, to how I started modding games, and writing my own stories, and drawing my own worldmaps. But I haven't done much of this in the past years, except for modding or developing a small game here and there (which never gets finished :P). So long as it entertains me!\n\nI hope you are having a nice weekend! Tell me about yourself, your stories, your experiences? Who are you, what makes you you? Or, for less deep questions; where do you live, what do you do? And how old are you? What do you want in life, where do you want to be next year? Or in five years? Or, you know, send me anything you like!\n\nHave a good day or night, smilingly bathing in warm sunlight, or in peace under moon's silvery sight - if you do wish to write, take all the time you need to do it right, and don't worry, I don't bite! :)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

My grandmother died from lung cancer and my mom cared for her from April-June this year when she passed away and my mom had to deal with all of the legal stuff and my uncle wouldn't help her (idk why). Then in August right before my mom's 60th birthday my mom had kidney stones and then a kidney infection. She called me at work hysterical and telling me that she was going to die because she had no idea where the pain was coming from. \n\nI've always had anxiety about something bad happening to my mom for as long as I can remember. I'm an only child and I'm not close with my dad or any other extended family. I don't really have many friends who care. After my mom was hospitalized with her kidney infection, I was basically scared to death every day at work that I would get a phone call like that again. \n\nMy mom had her mammogram back in late October (she was 2 years overdue for one) and they found something, and then had another test last week Wednesday, and just today they confirmed that it was cancer. My mom goes to the hospital on Thursday for her consultation. I have no idea what stage of cancer she has, if it's treatable or how long my mom has left to live. I always imagine the worst because that's always what happens. I have no idea how to cope with work, or with anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom told me not to tell anyone so I won't- but I don't know anyone on Reddit. I am terrified that I do not have that much time left with my mom. She didn't tell me about her diagnosis until today. My dad was yelling at me telling me how my crying isn't going to help anyone or solve anything, and that they shouldn't have told me at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't handle this. If my mom dies I will kill myself. I can't stop crying and I don't know how I'm going to socially interact with anyone at work tomorrow...or anyone at all for that matter. The tears just keep on coming and I don't know how to make them stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took PTO from work yesterday and today because I was going to go on vacation but then I get this news. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any advice on how to cope, please tell me.

A few days later we found out that not only are we also neighbors, but we\u2019re cousins. \nWe were going great up until grade 6 where she decided to bully me in school to become \u201cpopular\u201d and have older friends. \n\nFast forward to high school when I sat with her one day at lunch and we were pretty much inseparable ever since. But now I have my GED and she dropped out and has a dead beat boyfriend who can\u2019t stand me because I sleep in the same bed as her when I spend the night. He\u2019s actually jealous of her cousin? I can\u2019t even wrap my head around it. Anyways, because of his hatred towards me she decided to ghost me for months, until they broke up. But then she let him back in and pushed me back out. \n\nI\u2019m tired of her thinking she can just pop in and out of my life whenever she pleases. Her and her boyfriend tried to start a fight with me on my birthday because some guy texted her and they thought I sent him, but it\u2019s just ridiculous because they know I\u2019m a hippie and I have nothing but love to give. \n\nA few days ago I talked to her after I ghosted her for 3 months because her brother made me go bowling with him, and she\u2019s still the same negative, and abusive friend I\u2019ve always known. She puts me down so she can rise on her pedestal. If something doesn\u2019t go her way she\u2019s out here threatening to kill herself and screaming at everyone until they give in. Anytime I try to rant/vent to her about my Bipolar Disorder or Panic Attacks, she immediately shuts it down and starts talking about her problems. \n\nMy family wonders why I\u2019m this quiet pushover who will allow anyone to walk all over me, and it\u2019s because I\u2019ve taken her abuse for the past 11 years. I\u2019m so lost at this point. I just want to focus on my painting and poetry but it\u2019s impossible when I have to be on the edge of my seat for her incase any sort of inconvenience occurs for her. \n\nShe has forced any other friend I had out of my life so now I have no one except her and I\u2019m not sure I want her around. I\u2019ve been on a spiritual journey and I\u2019m such a positive person now. I\u2019ve really found my true self, but she\u2019s draining me to the point of where I can\u2019t even imagine having anyone around me. \n\nAfter being friends for 11 years, I just want to put an end to our chapter, but I\u2019m not sure how or even where to start. All I know is that I\u2019m just fine with being a loner and I don\u2019t think I could have any other friends for a while because I just can\u2019t imagine anyone would even want to treat me as an equal. I can\u2019t have her around me anymore, but I don\u2019t want to hurt her. I need some major advice, please and thank you. &lt;3", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I\u2019m F20 btw. She always criticizes me and says really hurtful things. For example, she once told me that if I got plastic surgery, I would be really pretty. She purposely tells me I\u2019m not good at my passions. I am learning Spanish in college and my best friend told me I shouldn\u2019t pursue it because I\u2019m not good at it. Keep in mind: she learned Spanish for 2 years in high school but dropped it, so how would she know who is good/bad at it. Also, I know I\u2019m good at it because I study really hard and multiple teachers have told me I\u2019m very good at it. im always top of my class. \n\nAnyway, recently my friend seems to continuously one up me. These examples may not seem to be big deals, but I began to get the feeling something was going on and I didn\u2019t even really acknowledge it until my boyfriend pointed it out. \n\nI began to eat healthy and workout everyday. I began to see physical changes in my body. My friend began to praise me for it and then began going to the gym and eating healthy too. Which, is actually really great! I have nothing against that. However, she kept praising how I have abs now and all she wants now is abs. I dont think she wants to go to the gym and eat healthy for the normal reasons (such as gaining confidence and being healthier), she only goes in order to get abs. She never tried to get abs before she began to say I have them.  \n\nSecond, I began to take care of my hair and grow it long. My friend would always tell me my natural hair is ugly, and when I grew it long, everyone began to tell me how beautiful my natural hair is (my natural hair is curly). My friend would openly disagree when people would compliment my hair, but then she began trying to grow her hair long too. She all of a sudden became very passionate about her hair and take all these gummy vitamins to grow it long. She eventually came to me for advice on how to grow it. \n\nOh, and going off the spanish example. I learn Spanish in school and am majoring in it. All of a sudden, when my friend learns I\u2019m majoring in it, she tells me I\u2019m bad at it but then tries learning french. All she wants to do is learn french, which she never wanted to do before she knew I had a passion for Spanish. \n\nThird, she goes after all my ex boyfriends. At first, my one ex boyfriend (who I dated for 4 years) was texting her asking how to get me back. Then, she continuously let him text her and then it got to the point where they were still texting a year after our breakup. Then, whenever he would flirt with her she would let him and even flirted back. This is after she told me she would block him 3 times. Then, we were at a party when my other ex boyfriend began to flirt with her in front of me. Instead of walking away or being weirded out that her best friend\u2019s ex was flirting with her, she took it in and accepted it. She was like bathing in the fact that he was flirting with her. She loved it. \n\nNow, if my best friend has genuine feelings for an ex of mine, then I don\u2019t care. But, to me, it seems like she just likes their attention. Which is weird because you shouldn\u2019t crave the attention for your best friend\u2019s ex boyfriends. I can also tell she tries to brag about the things they say to her and tries to make it casual, even though it\u2019s super weird that she talks to ex boyfriends of mine. It\u2019s also really hurtful. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t care so much about this situation if it weren\u2019t hurtful. The mean things she says seems to be said to purposely knock down my self esteem. She criticizes my appearance and the subjects I am passionate about. She also flaunts the attention of my ex boyfriends and it hurts a lot. Considering I only broke up with my one ex 1 year ago (when we had a 4-year-long relationship), it just brings back old scars. \n\nI care about this friend a lot and have known her since I was a baby. I don\u2019t really want cause problems between us, so I don\u2019t know how to handle this situation.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

He thanked me for reaching out, but said he had unrelated stresses going on in his life and wasn't in the mind frame to dive into our issue... i said fair enough. I know he had some dating issues going on and also his parents have health issues so I didn't want to push our small thing ahead of those bigger things. \n\nNow another 2-3 months have gone by. I have heard from mutual friends that he has gone on a couple pretty epic vacations, but still has not reached back out to me to take me up on my offer to smooth things over. \n\nI am a little annoyed that I was the one who put pride aside to reach out and he has pretty much left me hanging. Part of me wants to call him on it, but for the most part I just want to sit back and wait for him to smarten up and do his part to fix things.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

This is a throwaway because I know for a fact the people mentioned in this story would hunt this down and try to make me seem like the bad guy. I apologize for the anonymity, and the fact some spellings may be off, due to my country.  I'll get into the story, since it's a long one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've known my friends for maybe 7 years. Met on a video game, and switched to Discord around the late 2015 mark. I only really stayed in contact with two of the people from that group, and for privacy's sake, I won't use their usernames or real names. Only one of them is relevant anyways, so I'll call her.. Hannah. Hannah was an extremely good friend of mine, we'd dated briefly, all was good. She was extremely immature though, and a year younger than me. My laptop broke in 2017, and I only a few weeks ago got my new PC, which caused alot of back and forths and arguments since she was spoilt aswell. She would constantly ask 'Hey, when can you play (the video game we met on) again?' and when I said I didn't know, would proceed to get pissed off and yell at me, and or block me.\n\nHannah recently gained a crush I'll just call Nick. Nick, I'd never met before. Hannah and I only knew each other online, as she lived in a different country about a 12 hour flight away from me. I didn't think of it that much, until she became obsessed. Badly. Printed out pictures of Nick and stuck it to her walls, talked about killing her friends over him, took photos he had no idea even existed. She convinced alot of her IRL friends to also take pictures and try hook her up with him aswell. Yandere Sim level shit. It was awful, so I tried talking to her, which lead in a block. \n\nShe did later unblock me, and around this time also, I'd reconnected with two other friends from our friend group. I'll call the one who knows about this post Everett, and the other, his current boyfriend, Alex. Everett and I quickly reconnected, as we both have a common interest; the 1910s-1990s. Alex and I were on an alright basis, and at the time we'd reconnected he hadn't even admitted to Everett he liked him, so Hannah and I talked to him, and convinced him to do it.\n\nHe eventually did, and, well, they began dating. To this current date, they are still dating, but they've had quite a few big arguments.\n\nMe, Everett, Hannah and Alex were joking around on Discord with the new status update, putting stuff like 'finna adopt (my name)', to which Alex blocked me and Everett. Everett saw it as a joke, and so did I, but Hannah on the other hand. Ooh boy did she go off. She was not pleased. and blocked me for a second time in that month. Everett tried talking to her and him, and got unblocked by Alex, but Hannah ignored him.\n\nFew weeks down the line, I'd lost pretty much all my friends. Never had many to begin with. Everett, however, stuck with me. For what reason, I have no fucking clue, but I actually am really grateful for that. \n\nHannah blocked me because I made a joke about one of her characters being pregnant. I made that joke 2 years ago.\n\nOn the game we met.\n\nEverett and I concluded she was fucking mental, and we didn't go on about it any further. She does pop up in conversation now and again, but that's really it. Alex however, pops up frequently. Alex hates me. I don't know why. I don't think I did anything wrong, but you never know. Whenever I'm brought up into conversation between Everett and Alex, Alex will either accuse Everett of cheating on him, act extremely cold, or alike. \n\nWhen questioned, Alex said 'They were never my friend to begin with, so I don't care.'\n\nDid that hurt? Fuck yes. I'd known him since we were kids. This is getting too long, so I'll wrap it up. with a summary.\n\nTLDR: Two of my best friends have banded up together, blocked me on Discord and now talk shit about me behind my back. I feel awful about it, and want to talk to them again despite this. \n\nI only check this account every couple of days, so if I don't reply ASAP, I'm sorry. Any advice at all would be highly appreciated, as I have no idea what to do. I'm willing to provide Discord screenshots of conversations proving this, and if you have any questions please ask me. \n\nThank you in advance!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I can add more details later, I just really need to talk to someone.   \nSo I'm very close with my family, but the one thing I've never been able to talk to them about is him. I've known him for 5 years since I started high school. On and off dating throughout those years. Last winter around this time he proposed to me, we were engaged and around March we got an apartment. My family never liked him, and I don't think they understood how much I loved and cared about him. But about 3-4 months ago, he went to jail for an unexpected warrant out for his arrest and failure to show to court. I was scared and was working two jobs at the time, I didn't have the money to bail him out. So I went to my family and they convinced me to let him sit and wait to see what happened. Someone eventually bailed him out after a couple of weeks and I had paid rent and all the bills by myself. I couldn't sleep because I was upset and worried. But by the time he got out I had decided it would be best to call off the engagement. We fought and argued but in the end, I still cared and told myself I at least needed to be his friend. And I was but we were still acting like we were a couple which led to a weird open relationship thing. He didn't see anybody and I had one date who was awful and it was kind of forced by co-workers.   \nWe are both very open and emotional people, and so we always have deep conversations, so we are always on the same page.   \nI went to see him this morning and we were cuddling because he was still half-asleep. I noticed he was thinking about something and asked what he was thinking about.   \nHe doesn't want to be a secret. I can't do anything, my family hates him and no one, not even my friends support us being together. We tried everything but life just kind of forced us into the way it is now, but he wants to be done.

why would you blow candy? this was last year. however, i went through a long and lengthy discussion with her about it and told her not to endanger her health like that again and gave her the benefit of the doubt assuming that she genuinely had no knowledge of vaping.\n\nbut she\u2019s grown older now and has been much more exposed to these things than i have and knows the risks and dangers of vaping at such a young age. \n\nnot only is she promoting this (illegal) activity on her social media where anyone can see, she\u2019s also encouraging her peers to follow as well. i\u2019m not sure if you can attach images, but basically it was a giveaway for whoever reposted on their story. \n\ni was appalled and decided to question her further on it. after getting dry answers, she finally explained that she was simply helping an older friend out and she \u201cwould never do that\u201d and that\u2019s when i lost it.\n\nlike i just said, she had done this before. the fact that she lied and her story does not add up creates more suspicion and i can\u2019t trust what she\u2019s saying when everything is contradicting itself. \n\ni blocked her number, snap, ig, twitter, everything. i know it\u2019s a rash move, but please read my explanation. this wasn\u2019t one time, but multiple different incidents that built up over the past three years. \n\nwe\u2019re minors and not only that, we\u2019re young. the pressure to have a s/o is constantly there in our everyday life and while i\u2019m personally uninterested since i would actually like to enjoy my youth, my friend has dated multiple times before. \n\ni didn\u2019t mind it at first. it was only here and there, not too bad and i thought it wasn\u2019t a big deal since it was just those casual middle school relationships. but after she met this boy, let\u2019s call him eric, she fell head over heels for him. \n\ntbh he\u2019s a jerk. so rude, so immature, terrible speaker, awful communicator, and isn\u2019t someone that as a friend i approve of. but she LOVED him. no matter how neglected she was, she still hung onto that bit of hope where everything will work out and they\u2019re insta goals as couples. \n\ni never liked eric and my friend being together since not only was he terrible and toxic for her, my friend neglected us and our church. church is extremely important to us and as christians, i think it should be one of the top priorities. that doesn\u2019t mean to ignore everything else, but have some respect for our pastor and God, you know? \n\nshe took advantage of my time and constantly begged me to do makeup at church retreats, waking me up at dawn to do it only for her to complain and berate me afterwards before she and eric got together. this was an attempt to grab his attention and impress him. \n\nshe would purposely embarrass me in order to get some laughs from him and his friends and during service would scream out profanities and vulgar language or talk smack about our pastor (shouting it, may i add). \n\nour church is very casual in comparison to your typical christian communities, wearing jeans and t-shirts to service isn\u2019t a big deal. but what is a big deal is her wearing a tube top and ripped jeans that run from her thigh to her knee. \n\nno shame in that when you\u2019re an adult, go for it! embrace your style! but this is church and deeply offensive to act like that and as a YOUNG TEEN. you\u2019re not even old enough to wear that, have some modesty! \n\nyou\u2019re not 23, you\u2019re too young to wear something so inappropriate like that in this kind of setting! act your age! \n\nlast but not least, she\u2019s so secretive. she lives to leave people out of everything and i\u2019m getting tired of it. now that i\u2019m writing things out i\u2019m so glad i cut off everything with her. \n\nshe\u2019s now using boys to replace her friends, including me. after she and eric broke up, she\u2019s trying to fill that gap with other people, more \u201ccooler\u201d people if you will. and unfortunately, i don\u2019t fit into her wannabe lifestyle. \n\ni don\u2019t want to grow up like that. i want to be happy through art and sweet ballads and living my life in church and school. i don\u2019t want to be the school\u2019s drug dealer or insta \u201cbaddie\u201d who can\u2019t even show some decency in a religious setting. \n\nbut i can\u2019t. i\u2019m still trapped. my friends are her close friends. i don\u2019t have anyone. so now i\u2019m just losing everything (socially) at church. no one acknowledges me and it hurts that in an environment where love and kindness is so emphasized, there\u2019s nothing but drama and toxicity in here. \n\nit really is hurting me and i need help. please, someone help me. if there\u2019s something i can do, please tell me and let me know. i need advice.\n\nthanks if you read this far, i needed to get a lot off my chest. have a great day :)\n\nedit: i forgot to mention, i totally understand the need to give my friend space. but when her parents are fully aware of the situation at hand and don\u2019t do ANYTHING about it, that\u2019s what i think crosses the line. \n\ni don\u2019t want to sound like a possessive freak who\u2019s trying to \u201cshield\u201d my friend away from the world. it\u2019s just that i can\u2019t take this anymore and i want to bring back my church life again. i\u2019m fighting for my faith and i can\u2019t change churches, i\u2019ve been there since my birth and my mother has been attending for over 30 years. it would rip me apart if that happened.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I am quite a social person so I like to be busy or doing something every week or so. I understand there are times when people are going to be busy because that\u2019s just the real world. However, I feel like if I just stopped making any effort at all, the friendships I\u2019m in would crumble.\n\nIt\u2019s getting to the point now where we\u2019ve agreed to go out somewhere but I\u2019m getting very little input. An example would be very recently where I asked my two vegetarian friends where they would like to eat taking into consideration there dietary needs. I received no response, I moved on and later asked for some suggestions for some of the bars we could try and this time got a response but with limited suggestions at best.\n\nIt\u2019s not just down to me to message everyone and check people\u2019s availability, I then have to make every single decision about where we go and what to do.\n\nI don\u2019t want to fall out with these people, they do have some good qualities but I feel as though I\u2019m carrying a whole group of friends. Surely it shouldn\u2019t be down to 1 person out of a group of 8 people to organise or instigate absolutely everything?\n\nIn the past 6 months alone, I\u2019ve been the one to suggest meeting for a pint at the end of a week, I\u2019ve invited people over to my house, I\u2019ve organised nights out, helped a friend when he needed an extra player for his rugby team and I\u2019ve even invited my friends over to watch the football on a weekend. It\u2019s a strange one because all of the above, my friends have turned up to, it just feels like they are incapable of considering how much effort it takes for me to do this.

I do some crafty things and have a few cosplays I've worked on but nothing super fancy.

Like I get online friendships often don't do that, but I want the possibility of being in each other's lives to exist. Maybe a vacation here and there or maybe something more substantial. So someone in the us or Canada would be ideal. But the UK or Australia is cool too. Other countries are fine, but I just feel like culturally can be too different to feel connected with. \n\nWell anyway I'm not sure what else to say, I've probably said too much, but if you're interested in taking message me or whatever.

Will give TLTR at bottom.\n\nSo I have have two good friends, one will call CeCe and the other we will call Rock. I have known Rick since high school, we had a brief break in friendship during my marriage to my ex husband. We reconnected after the divorce and he introduced me to CeCe. We had Fun just the three of us. Now rock has always been a reserved guy, sweet and kind but like his name says into music. The summer after my divorce, we had fun and Rock and I had a fling to meet both our needs and see if it could turn into anything. It didn\u2019t and we realized we were not the same people.  Still we had a good time and remained close. CeCe and I hung out and enjoyed each other\u2019s company as we have a lot of things in common. \n\nFast forward, to 2019, Rock is trying to win the heart of a girl he likes. I\u2019m supportive and try to help. CeCe is traveling abroad and plans to come back before he next semester. Then when CeCe returns turns out she has no home to go back to since she was living with family who kicked her out, took her rent and left her on the metaphorical curb. She asks me to move in. I agree, on the condition that she get a job and pay rent  ($400 or obo). She moves in and works to get a job and is pleasant. Finally gets a part time job. \n\nNow it\u2019s February and I meet someone. We will call him Deku. We click right away and our relationship grows leaps and bounds. He is renting a room from an unstable acquaintance who kicks him out because she got a FWB who wants in.  He has no where to go so I take him in to the house. He pays rent and buy food, cleans everything and our relationship grows. CeCe gets a boyfriend, and within two months is in engaged. At this point i haven\u2019t charged her rent because sh was still getting on her feet and she made a scene about it. Deku says don\u2019t worry about the rent, I\u2019ve got it covered and let\u2019s be kind and let her get on her feet. \n\nSo she has been here trying to get on her feet and is now working full time. Deku, CeCe and I  agree that when Deku and I move apartments she will not be movi with us. Deku and I noticed how she acts with money and feels it\u2019s better to save a friendship rather than get money involved. Things are stable.\n\nSpring and summer are fun but full of of all of us working. We enjoy meeting up for dinner and the beach. Life is good.  Rock and Deku are getting along, CeCe\u2019s fianc\u00e9 (we can call Gamer) is good. Also CeCe brings around her friend Lee who is amazing. \n\nOctober is here and CeCe and I want to do a friends giving. The apartment is small but Rock has moved into a 2b and would have enough room. We call and ask and he agrees. Cue the group chat were we narrow down the menu, and exchange info. \n\nI keep asking Rock what food he wants to know and get \u201cidk\u201d then he gets made I assign him something. (I suggested drinks and apps) he gets mad and says he we don\u2019t need them. Deku says he will buy drinks and snacks from his job. I let everyone know I will borrow table and chairs from my parents and drop them the nights before.\n\nDeku and I drive up the nite before when I get a lecture that I\u2019m coming late. Duly noted. Ask what time for tommow? He says no earlier than 1pm. Mind you I\u2019m cooking a 20lb turkey so I tell him hey it will be late eating but I\u2019m okay. \n\nNext day Deku Gamer, CeCe and I are driving up to Rocks\u2019s place (over an hour away).  We run to the store to get last min items and call Rock. Took him 30mins to get to the door. CeCe and I start decorating and he goes off. We stop. Apparently we are crossing the boundaries set as we \u201cdid not ask permission\u201d. Then Rock lectures me about the turkey.\n\nRock cannot find any kindness that day. Everything a criticism. Says he is hungry and mad no snacks . Deku offers his selection and turns up his nose at it. Deku offers that he will buy pizza, Rock blows him off. We call Lee who was coming later to bring snacks. I am so tired and sad after I finish up my prep I go sit down. Gamer senses I\u2019m in pain and strikes up a convo, I feel better for the moment. \n\nComplaints range from:\n\u201cThere is not enough food\u201d -&gt; \u201ctoo much food\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dare you ask to watch a movie when I have music on?!\u201d -&gt; \u201cno I won\u2019t play exploding kittens woth you guys! How dare you not want to sit and just listen to music!\u201d\n\n\u201cIDC if the directions say cooking the turkey with stuffing! It looks fine!\u201d \n\n\u201cYou know I love you OP but I hate you right now.\u201d\n\nAlso a lot of BEC face and attiude\n\nThen Rock comes from behind and hugs me and cuddles me. I am in so much pain and distress (I have fibromyalgia) that I barely process it. \n\nThen he is back to being mean. I feel so unwelcome there I tell everyone, let\u2019s pack up and leave so he can be happy. Asks why we are all rushing. Said to him you are tired so we are leaving, and he says \u201cwhat about cake?\u201d So we eat cake and leave. \n\nOn the way to drop Gamer at his house, CeCe Deku and I start talking. We are disappointed on what happened. The. I realize I left my purse at Rock\u2019s. When Deku and I settle into bed that night we talk about the BS. He tells me that he couldn\u2019t believe the nerve Rock had being affectionate with me and then being a jerk. The words he used \u201ccopping an emotional feel\u201d. And said he doesn\u2019t care that Rock can be affectionate with me (I have no secrets with Deku, he knows about the fling) but hates Rock was being a dick.\n\nI make arrangements for Rock and I to meet up at a mall. I tell them I need to talk to him about the way he acted. Tell him I felt so hurt be unwelcome. Explained how Deku felt about him touching me. Said clearly I do not speak for CeCe only for me and deku. He teared up I told him I love and care for him but we won't ask him to borrow his space anymore but will invite him to things. Told him how the way he is acting would turn off the girl he likes. Also that it really sad he wouldn't treat Gamer or Deku like this but just CeCe and I (No one messes with Le because she will kya or tear you to pieces). I tell.Deku how it goes and let him know I will tell CeCe later. \n\nGet a message from CeCe the next afternoon that Rock CeCe and I ONLY should hang out. I tell her Rock isn\u2019t going to want to and tell her I have had a convo with him. CeCe says This is must and this will save the friendship. I say I\u2019m down. Nothing happens as of yet.\n\nGet home talk to Deku that Cece approaches him saying she wanted the story from his side. Deku asks if she has talked to Rock, and says no, but Deku feels she is lying as the flow of the convo doesn\u2019t add up. CeCe tells Deku that he and I moved in to early together, that he makes me \u201cclingy\u201d, that \u201chaving sex daily\u201d isn\u2019t not good and so on. Deku tells me about when I get home. \n\nI want to cry and Deku is laughing at the irony. He explained to CeCe that I was struggling to support them both before he came (true,) CeCe denies it. Also mentioned that we don\u2019t have sex everyday and we don\u2019t do it when she is here even tho it\u2019s not her business. Addresses that we might be clingy with each other but any new couple would be and is not like I have to have him around (went to brunch with Rock by myself, hang out with CeCe when Deku is in the bedroom). Also explained that I work 40hrs and have school online so I\u2019m more busy that before. \n\nDeku says that when we announce our engagement in  2020 that he would like her to move out. Am I the asshole here? Would that be breaking our promise to have her leave when we move? Advice please!\n\nTltr:\nGuy friend is a jerk for Thanksgiving Friendsgiving. Hurts my feelings.

We had been friends since elementary through middle school. Throughout our friendship, we have had very little conflict because I try to be very accepting of her differences. Last year was our last year of middle school and it started out fine. She soon joined this south asian club that celebrates south asian cultures, such as Indian cultures. For the first half of the school year, friend A would constantly bring up the fact she was Indian. Now, I don\u2019t really care that she was proud about this, but every conversation we would have she would bring up the fact she was Indian, or how all my friends are Indian (I will call the group B), or how she and \u201cthe Indian community\u201d think of me as an unofficial Indian. This was just some mild annoyances during the first  semester. Friend A had a semi-popular friend group who I will call group C. Group C was the kind of group to go to the bathroom together to gossip. I was not particularly fond of this group because they will backstab anyone and make up for it the next day. Over winter break, Groups B and C seemed to have started to meld. All of a sudden, A is ignoring me in group conversations and talking to Group C. I will be in the middle of a sentence and a member of Group C will barge into the conversation and drag A to the bathroom to gossip. A never protested this and after it had gone on for some months, I worked up enough courage to tell A about my concerns during lunch. We were able to get about halfway through the conversation when a member from Group *B* walked up and interrupted the conversation. A went right to having a conversation with the B member and ignoring me. I recognized what she was doing and went back to eating because at this point, I knew she was done with my concerns. After a couple minutes her excuse was, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to not say hi to member B.\u201d I accepted this and we had minimal issues for a month or two. The last two months of 8th grade were a different story. At this point, C and B have fully merged into one group. To note, a majority of my friends were in group B (only 3 friends outside). Group C started to isolate myself from the rest of group B during the final two months. I would be excluded from conversations even if I was standing right there, they would make plans in-front of me without inviting me, and a whole bunch of other things. By the end of the year, my main form of contact with these people was through texts about homework. This year, things were still not off to a good start as most of group B still limits contact with me(not much beyond text or pleasantries) and make it obvious that they would rather talk to people in group C.\n\nDo I need to drop this group or try and rebuild relationships? I have also shared some private information with friend A that I no longer trust her with because of group C, so how do I deal with that?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

He's supremely extroverted, charismatic, and rather loud. Some might see him as obnoxious. \n\nAs of late, however, I've found myself resentful of his behavior, and can now only take him in small amounts. There were a few events which I won't go into that lead up to this point. But I'll tell you about one that still keeps me awake at night.\n\nI've been very open with him about my struggles with anxiety and panic disorder. But last week, he and I were walking and talking like normal, then he mentions how I piss him off sometimes. Naturally I'm flummoxed by this comment, because I'm the one keeping the mood of the house from falling apart completely, due to his past actions and inactions (he's messy and inconsiderate of rules). Not to mention I'm the one who reaches out to him to hang out on his days off.\n\nBut I digress. The reason he got pissed off was because I mentioned how I had near panic attacks when I was learning to swim at 4 years old. He attributes it to, \"Oh, all kids are scared the first time they go swimming,\" and, \"It's not anxiety. Anxiety is an emotion. Everyone in our generation didn't just wake up and have anxiety. People in our generation just have a need to feel special when they're not,\" and ending with the real kicker, \"I don't believe you.\" \n\nI felt hurt by these dismissive comments. Especially since I've opened up to him about my struggles. I was professionally diagnosed with these disorders at a young age, and tried to convince him that if you do have a professional diagnosis, then you likely damn well have the disorder and should seek necessary help. He, of course, has a reply for everything: \"Doctors are flawed and don't see the whole person when it comes to mental health.\"\n\nAll of this leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I could see no reasoning with him or sympathy from him either. \n\nIn sum, I want to salvage this friendship, because I still care about him. We've been through a lot together. So I'm wondering if any of you have experienced behaviors related to this, and how I can live with someone this dismissive of my feelings and experiences. Especially when they don't realize the impact of their behavior, even when you tell them straight to their face. \n\nSidenote: I believe he also has traits associated with BPD.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

The friendship has been great in many ways but incredibly frustrating and maddening in others. I always think back to the sex and the city episode when big goes to Aiden's cabin and complains about the woman he's dating saying \"she can call ME but i can't call HER\". For anyone whose been in this kind of relationship you get this. Where you know someone who's calls you take and return promptly if they go to voicemail....and yet when you try and reach them it's always voicemail, endless phone tag and even if they call you and you miss it by 5 minutes when you call back right after they  suddenly disappear again. \n\nImho phone tag is the most frustrating and ridiculous game people play with each other. Its like ha ha you cant get me!!!! Even though it was they who tried to reach YOU and not the other way around. Then you enter into this endless game of trying to chase them back. It's the stupidest thing on earth though i feel fairly confident some People actually get Off on it. \n\nI have a friend who does this regularly. I actually had to confront her about this as it drove me crazy. She could reach ME but I could never reach HER. \n\nMy free time is very precious to me as when I come home from work most days I feel like a zombie. All the life and joy has been sucked so talking with friends by phone makes me happy but chasing them is not a valuable use of my time.\n\nFor as long as I've known this person I have sought a solution so that I could avoid feeling resentment and work with her in a way that respects both of our time and schedules. If I missed her call and then tried several times to reach her back but was unable I tried texting to simply ASK hey when is a good time to call? I can call you then. OR I'd say hey I'm available after x time and can talk then. Wouldn't you know that she never would ever agree to provide me a time that good for her? Shed never say ok I'm free around 7pm onwards. How about we talk then ? Never. She would ignore the request. She never ever ever wants to or is able to lock herself into a time because that would mean the game of phone tag would be won by me (I guess! I dont know. I cant think of any other reason). Just tell me when is good for you!!! This is what I do with clients....this is how you reach people who are busy. I digress sometimes she will tell me a time shes free. However it is 100% of the time rigor in the middle of my workday. Yes then shes free as a bird. Not Saturday not sunday no evenings but when I'm at work and can sneak away or call on lunch she can be free for that. She can reach me I cant reach her. \n\nJust in the past week she has tried me a couple of times and I missed the call. It was a particularly tough week at work. When I caught my breath I tried to call back but of course I got HER voicemail. Not even trying to be a hypocrite. We BOTH missed each other's calls but rather than continuing a friendship with her voicemail j tried. To do what I can tried to find a time when we could both talk and text to ask when is good for her. No reply. None. \n\nThis has gone on long enough and I'm over it.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Hopefully. \n\nAnyways I used to regularly talk to someone I met on here, we talked about pretty much any- and everything that came to our minds. Some of it was pretty deep (by the way a lovely first subject could be what we think 'deep' means since that's such a weird concept) stuff, some of it was just totally goofy and had no purpose. I just really miss having someone to share thoughts with, exchange viewpoints on subjects or reflect ideas with, alongside having fun and fooling around. \n\nI like a ton of subjects, so even though I'd love for you to get to know me through chatting, I'll list some stuff I'm interested in: \n\n* Judo;\n* Cycling (mainly mountainbiking);\n* Anything sports honestly, even if I don't know anything about it I like hearing about stuff I've never even thought about;\n* Politics;\n* History;\n* Philosophy;\n* Psychology;\n* Cars and racing, but also anything mechanical and 'how stuff works-like' while we're at it;\n* Anything that runs on electricity as a bonus;\n* Music, a bunch of types but mainly rock/metal and recently jazz too;\n* Photography;\n* Like 10 things I'm forgetting to mention, probably.\n\nHonestly it's pretty easy for me to get interested and learn about new stuff so please don't think you need to be into any of those things to talk to me. \n\nI'm Dutch, so if you are too we won't have to speak English unless that's your thing.

I\u2019m not trying to be negative, but it really was somewhat of a bad time. \n\nI had a lot of friends in high school, but something happened which made me really shy. I had always been a shy girl, but I had gotten out of my shell in high school. Then, once that thing happened, I resorted back in my shell. However, since I had made so many friends (and close friends), I still had friends even when I somewhat isolated myself. Friends still cared about me. \n\nWhen I entered college, I watched everyone around me make friends. I didn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t make any. Of course, I made acquaintances but not real friends. I think it was because I\u2019m extremely shy and awkward. I have 0 confidence and I probably come off as an extremely closed off, shy girl. \n\nI had told all my friends what was going on and they tried to give me advice. They told me to just walk into one of the rooms of a girl living on my floor and say hi, what\u2019s up. So I did that and it seemed to work and a group of girls and I talked for a while and got dinner, but then I heard one of the girls talking shit on me so I just left and cried. \n\nThen, another time, I reached out to a girl asking if she was doing anything that night and she said yeah, that she\u2019s going out with some of her friends but she invited me to come. So I went, but I felt uncomfortable I felt like I had invited myself along. And I didn\u2019t feel that they wanted me there. \n\nI don\u2019t know, that\u2019s my experience. I did meet two people: my current boyfriend and a girl who is now my current roommate. That\u2019s it. \n\nMy question is: did I do anything wrong when I kinda pushed myself into hanging out with those people? I felt really out of place. Did I do something wrong?

Btw apologies for any spelling errors, I have diagnosed dyslexia.\n\nSo there is this girl in my class and we've been \"best friends\" for about a year now. (For anyone interested I'm a dude and we both in high school ) This Best Friend of mine, as she always insisted, helped me through a rough time a few months ago, I was dealing with suicidal thoughts not really a big deal anymore I'm good now. It has to be said that this was something completely new for me as I have never felt anything like this and usually am more the light hearted, don't take things too seriously kinda guy, where as she is more of serious, doom and gloomy person, which led to some instances of her taking things I said way too seriously and sometimes pretty much insisting that I have \"fallen into a deep hole\" as she puts it over stupid jokes. To be fair however I only realised this after the fact. It also has to be said, that she suffers from severe anxiety.\n\nSo time goes by and about a month ago I'm just really pissed at pretty much everything, honestly I was just overreacting but I have a tendency to, I'm what you'd call a theater kid. In the heat of a moment and I decide to delete all social media apps from my phone, which would kill the primary source of our communication as she doesn't really go out much and we just texted all day everyday. In one year we went out and did stuff together once, and not because of a lack of asking on my part, but after a dozen rejections I just didn't bother asking if she'd come along when I went out or if she wanted to do stuff. So anyways she contacts me via Snapchat before I deleted it and she's like \"oh what happened\", \"stay safe\" and stuff which I didn't like, cuz it sorta felt fake. So I just get out of the convo as quickly as possible, her last text to me was \"I love you\", I didn't answer anything (that was sorta normal with us to say ily like we were a couple, I honestly don't know why)\n\nWhen I reinstalled everything a day later I find that she has blocked me on all social media, I didn't understand why. This gave me a fucking full fledged panic attack and now in hindsight this is just prove to me that she made me emotionally dependent on her. I later find out that her mom forced her to do it, cuz apperantly she was crying till 12am, which just rly makes no sense. So Monday comes and I didn't know how I should face her but when I saw her in the halls, I waved as it was imo the least I could do to show that I want to get this thing resolved, she deadass looks me in the eyes and turns around. The next day I tell her that I want to get this thing resolved and she can just come to me when she's ready. A month passed since then. All she did was ignore me and try to rub it into my face that she has \"replaced\" me with another dude. To show me that she doesn't need me, the only thing that showed me was that she was manipulative and I don't want anything to do with her anymore. This led to me growing more and more hostile as well, not in a physical or verbal way, I just made it more and more clear that she wasn't welcome when she talked to the group of friends, which she only knows because I introduced them to each other, I haven't told them anything as I don't think it's any of their business but I did frequently just tell them to go somewhere during break and she did get the message and never came along.\nToday the guy who she \"replaced\" me with wasn't in school, he is also a good friend of mine, but he is kinda clueless and just tries to be as neutral as possible. Now she didn't have anything to sit next to and was like really slowly sitting down in my direct line of sight, idk maybe trying to get a response? In the end a friend of mine sitting next to me told her that she should come sot with us, I wanted to interfere but I didn't cuz I kinda felt bad for her in that moment.\n\nNow I still kinda do but I'm also still really pissed at her for treating me like a jizzed up condom and throwing me away, basically. Now I'm not sure if I should approach her again or just let it be. I'm still tending towards letting it be cuz I really don't want anything to do with her anymore, but as I said I felt bad even though she treated me ten times worse then I her. For the first 3 weeks or so I was very calm and didn't do anything, thinking I should give her some space but at some point I just had enough. Imo you shouldn't just ghost someone you called your very best friend for a year, because that person was pissed, but I'm open to second opinions. Pls don't hold back any punches and tell me your true honest opinion on how to proceed. I don't think many if any make it this far, but if you did thank you very much for giving me the time of day.

We have worked together, our kids are similar ages, and we actually used to live on the same block. I have been there for her for her highest points and her absolute lowest. Always have been a shoulder for her, or if she needed help with her kids, you name it... and vice versa, she has been there for me!\n\nIn the years that I've known Susie, she has had 5 relationships, 3 of them being \"serious.\" She began dating the 5th guy (Josh) about a year ago. At first all seemed well... until not even a couple months in, she found out he had slept with someone around the time they first began dating, then soon after she caught him \"sexting\" and sending nudes to someone else. This happened yet again maybe 3 months into their relationship. And about 5 months ago, she caught him (yet again!) sexting some random girl he met at his job. Her excuse to me as to why she didn't kick him out or leave him was, \"I'm in my 30s with 3 kids, no one else is going to want me!\"\n\nWhenever we would all go out for \"girls nights\" (maybe once every couple months), Susie's boyfriend would come and stay (not sitting with us, but staying in the same restaurant or bar) and then when he felt it was time to go, would tell her it was time to leave. She would make plans with us, then cancel last minute or not show up, \"because Josh didn't feel like going out.\" She stopped coming to get-togethers we would have (\"Friendsgiving\", football Sundays, you name it) because, \"Josh isn't very social.\"\n\nNow through all this, Susie has allowed this guy to move into her house, drive her car, take on the \"father\" role of her kids. He drives her to/from work, shopping, wherever she needs to go. He has slowly started making comments about some of her acquaintances and she began cutting them off. I guess I should have seen the writing on the wall, but I honestly didn't think she'd cut me off after we've been such good friends for so long.  But, after him screwing up multiple times and knowing that she tells me EVERYTHING, Josh decided to start telling her what a \"bad influence\" that I am.

And I have the biggest room in the house... my pregnant roommate thinks I should switch rooms with her so she can have some extra room for the baby. There\u2019s a part of me that thinks I should give in and be a nice friend and help out and just give her the room. But there\u2019s also another part that\u2019s like .. well she\u2019s the one the got pregnant. What\u2019s that have to do with me and why do I need to switch MY room just because she\u2019s having a baby. I understand it may be the NICE thing to do.. but would I be a complete dick head if I kept my room and let her just stay in hers? Should I feel obligated to switch rooms?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve been getting a lot of good advice but I think I\u2019d like to throw some background information as well. \n\nI\u2019ll try to shorten this but I was homeless for a few months and I wouldn\u2019t even have a place to stay if it wasn\u2019t for her. We had a place together before the one we are currently in. And immediately she called \u201cdibs\u201d on biggest bedroom. And when I wasn\u2019t homeless and had a job me and her were looking for places together. Every single place we went to she NEEDED the biggest room. Before I could even call my \u201cdibs\u201d she had already said it. And I personally don\u2019t care for a big room. But she made me care when she made it a point to CLAIM everything first. So fast forward to my current situation. Like I said.. I now have the biggest room (which I had to fight her on because she said gets it because she called dibs on it when we first saw it listed.. but then had went with our previous apartment) and she\u2019s also the type to if we argue she holds everything over my head. How she\u2019s helped me with money and a place to stay and how I wouldn\u2019t be in the situation I am if it wasn\u2019t for her. And she had said that because of those reasons she DESERVES stuff like having the biggest room in the house. And when I had made it known I want the room I\u2019m currently in, she had went ahead of time and moved all her stuff into the room. \n\nSo the fact that I had to fight for the room I have now already makes me a bit salty that she expects me to give it to her since she\u2019s pregnant. And yes her room is a bit small but definitely CAN fit a crib and really that\u2019s the only furniture she needs. Our house is huge enough for toys and playpen to go downstairs. \n\nI guess you can say I\u2019m just a bit mad because of the fact that I fought so hard to get that room\nBecause I truly felt she was in the wrong to just claim it because of what I previously went through with her at all the other places. \n\nNow having said all that.. do y\u2019all still think it\u2019d be best for me as a friend to be nice and switch or what? Any other opinions and questions? I just personally don\u2019t want heat from my friend group. A lot of them think I should automatically give my room up...and I feel like they\u2019ll look at me bad for not wanting to up for switching rooms.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Onto about me I guess? I love philosophy and psychology and in the years  of isolation I spent most of my time focusing on helping others and not myself (so I promise I will try my best to be there for you too!). I will spend hours talking philosophy as well, deep conversations are my favorite! Now of course I don\u2019t consider myself a professional but I\u2019m going to school next year to become a psychologist! Though I recommend a professional overall if needed haha. I love videogames and have been a pc gamer since preschool. I\u2019m cool with playing whatever but lately I\u2019ve been playing reach, wow, mw (don\u2019t judge lol) and any single player games ranging from classics to current gen. I am a huge cinematography nerd if you want to watch some cool ass movies I\u2019m your guy! If you want a feel for the movies I like most, my favorite directors include Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, Ari Aster, Harmony Korine, and more. Now I don\u2019t always need to watch a deep and usually depressing movie but they are favorites! I\u2019m pretty open with movies though and horror movies are a big guilty pleasure of mine. I love reading but usually most of the books I like are because I watched the movie first haha. I love tv shows, pretty much down for anything other then super hero shows. I love all kinds of music, if you somehow come across my Spotify playlist it\u2019s very bipolar to say the least lol.

For the past few years I used drugs as a way to make friends, I truly thought people would like me more and think I was cool if I did. \n\nIt took a long time for me to realize that nobody was really my friend and rather just wanted someone to get messed up with. Around a year ago my best friend, the only person in the whole world I truly felt was a true friend, pretty much drugged me. I ended our friendship immediately, and came to the realization that if I want to truly connect with anyone, I need to stop using drugs as something to lean on. It took a lot of thinking for me to realize that I don\u2019t want this to be a part of my personality anymore. \n\nI\u2019m 8 months clean of nearly everything, and I\u2019m trying to completely quit smoking weed(this is what I\u2019ve used the most to hide behind).

I\u2019m really scared to make new friends because I feel so hollow and empty, and my anxiety tells me nobody would want to be friends with a soulless loser.

She was the first friend I made freshman year so we were inseparable and such. As we got into adulthood, things slowly changed to the point where she was toxic towards me. Let's just say she did a lot of stuff and never supported me for anything. The final time we talked, it was very ugly some ended the friendship on a very bad note.\n\nThat was 4 years ago.\n\nBack in April, we found out a band we used to love were going back on tour and she, very surprisingly, reached out to me about it. The concert was in July so when the time came, we did meet up. Although, we didn't greet one another with a hug or anything like that but some of our interactions felt like old times. We hadn't seen each other since but still make small talk sometimes. We know the friendship ended on a bad note and it was mentioned but we never actually talked about it if that makes any sense?\n\nI can't help but miss the friendship we once had but it'll never outweigh the toxicity. The number one thing I'm looking for is an apology and back then, I never got it. Anytime we had a fight during the friendship, I was the one apologizing because of how much she would put me down and have me feel bad.\n\nIs there a right or wrong way to this? I would like to meet up for lunch or something and talk but because of how bad it once was and how much I would get the blame, I'm afraid it'll be the same. All I want is for her to finally say \"I'm sorry\" and meant it.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "ea9lbx", "created_utc": 1576269876, "title": "How do I help my friend?", "author": "pastbestlast", "self_text": "Tldr at the end.\n\nFor a bit of context lemme explain what's been going on with my friend.. we'll call him Brian.\n\nI work as a contractor and had been giving Brian work because he needed it.  I'd known him from when we were both 4 till about 14.  Then we had some years apart and starting hanging out again in our 20s.  That was still some years ago so we've known each other a while.  Growing up he was my next door neighbor and until recently, still was my parents' neighbor.\nFor one job, that was a big one, I needed all the help I could get and Brian said his dad could also work and could use the money.  I said sure, I'd known his dad growing up, he was a good guy.  \nSo we work the job, I pay them well, I lend them a car to use to get to the job and use for lunch and get home.  Things go fine.  My parents are out of town this weekend so they ask me to watch the house.  No problem.\nSo I get to their house as I am staying the weekend and Brian and I were hanging out, having some drinks and chillin.  We're outside and his parents are inside, he yells up to his dad to bring some tool out as we were looking at Brian's car.  The windows to the house are open so he can definitely be heard.  We keep talking and his dad is taking a while so Brian calls him.. \"Hm. No answer. Alright whatever I'll just go get it\"\nSo brian goes around the front of his house to go upstairs and finds his dad passed out with his head on the sidewalk and his feet on the porch stoop.  \nFrom behind the house I hear, \"Dad?  Dad!  Wake up!.. Hey! Wake up!\"  I run around the house and find the scene.  His dad starts to wake up but is totally out of it.  We get him sat down on the porch and are trying to figure out what happened and why he fell and his dad just keeps falling asleep on us.  Not wanting him to fall asleep in case he had a concussion we keep waking him up.  We cant keep him awake more than 15 seconds before we have to snap him awake again.  This goes on for a couple minutes and his mom comes down.  She dismisses it almost laughingly and says he musta taken too many pain pills and he does this and we need to go to Walgreens and get him a narcam.  (From what I understand that is a treatment for narcotics to stop an overdose).\nWe get him in the car and rush over to Walgreens.  One problem.  Neither of us have cash as we forgot it in a rush and the thing costs $125.  So brian calls his friend who is a nurse.  They say to keep him awake and get him to the hospital.  So we do that and rush to the hospital.  A couple hours go by and Brian's dad is back to normal.  He was very dehydrated as he'd been drinking mountain dew all day in the sun and hadn't had any water that was there.  The doctor seemed that he was keeping from us that there was other stuff in his system, we knew there was.  But he wouldn't say it.  So we're all in the room talking and cracking some jokes and his dad starts rustling through his pockets and searching through his clothes laying around.  He was looking for his stash.  He gets super pissed off and swears he has it.  Then realizes he doesn't and looks at us.  He says we have to go home right away because Brian's mom probably found his stash and it was really strong so we needed to go back and make sure she was ok and presumably brian needed to find it and keep it away from her.  \nSo we rush back to his house all the way calling her and it is radio silence.  She won't answer.  We get back to his house.  He rushes upstairs and finds her, sitting on a chair, unresponsive.  I run up the stairs a minute or two later and he's trying and wake her up.  We pour cold water on her we slap and shake her we yell at her and she won't wake up.  We try to check for a pulse but she's pretty overweight and we can't tell if there's a pulse or not.  Maybe a weak one?  So we lie her on her back and try to do CPR.  Brian can't stomach the situation so I give her cpr while he calls 911 and gets an ambulance here.  I keep trying to breathe life into her until the ambulance gets there.  \nThey epi pen her they shock her they give her the cpr machine.. Nothing works.  She's dead.\nBrian is torn up, crying and calling people.  The cops are there, they eventually get us all out of the house and what follows is the whole process of notifying Brian's uncles and getting her body out etc.\nDuring the following day Brian's dad comes back and is completely shaken but the cops insist they've got to take him.  Brian is in a state of shock and grief and is subconsciously and not so subconsciously blaming his dad for what happened.  He trashes the house and removes everything of sentimental or monetary worth and hides it and comes and stays with me for about a month.\nDuring that month or so I take him to work almost every day and we try to put our lives back together.  Mine just keeps going.  This was certainly fucking crazy as I havent even mentioned all the drama that ensued with the local gangs and his dad and their whole family not trusting my friend or his dad or his sister and not caring what happens to them etc.\nSo all that was a bit over a year ago.  They kept living in that house, not paying their landlord the rent who was too nice of a guy slash too scared to kick them out.  Brian's dad slipped back into addiction and his drug addicted uncle came to live with them and slowly Brian's dad turned into someone desperately trying to escape his problems and only working for and chasing his fix.  He mentally blocked his old self and was no longer honest about.. really anything.\n Brian never really got out of this state of shock and after that faced a lot of depression as none of his family would help them.  He couldn't hold a job he couldn't escape his thoughts.  He didn't want to drink or use any drugs and he kept on having suicidal thoughts and all that.  Even though he kind of blames his dad and kind of hates him they still live together and look out for each other...  Brian constantly sees himself as the victim in situations and over this period of time I keep trying to snap him out of all of this.  He's got a chance to start a new life.  He should get the fuck out of that house and find some roommates or move to another state as nothing here is holding him back from doing so etc.  I keep taking him to work but I can't have him stay with me as when he stays there he sleeps during the day and paces around at night going between the porch for a cigarette and the fridge for food.  Then if I take him to work he's falling asleep all day.\nSo more time passes and I keep giving him work and he shows up at 2pm to eat some food that I brought for everyone and then asks for a ride home at 5 cuz he's gotta go flip this aluminum ladder or this router or this drill set.\nAs time goes on Brian slowly cuts off all the branches he's been sitting on one by one.  His on-and-off girlfriend will no longer deal with him.  His sister just wants to act like she has nothing to do with any of this.  His other uncles and his grandpa wont help him cuz they think he's on drugs..  and to be honest who knows?  He wont be honest with me anymore and I don't think he can even help it.  Time keeps going on and he is dishonest with me about a job.  I confront him about it and he still keeps lying to me until I prove without a doubt I know he is lying.  Then he profusely apologizes swearing it wont happen again etc.  So the work I give him tapers down as how am I supposed to give him a task to do and know it's done?  Do I have to go check and make sure things are done how they are supposed to be every time?  I'm not a babysitter or a disciplinarian I can't run a business like that.  As well as from his last lie I would've charged someone for a job not even done if I hadn't figured it out before I did.  This obviously wasn't working.\n\nSo time keeps moving.  The landlord that wasn't collecting his rent from them has passed and his son is now getting the house cleared out and has basically kicked them out, not in a mean way.. they just weren't paying and had no intention to and he lives outta state so he's selling the house bla bla bla.\n\nIt took a while.  But Brian finally got himself a truck and started doing his own work of all kinds.  Flipping craigslist stuff and doing odd jobs.  I'm not actively avoiding him, but I'm not actively involving him in my life as much.\nThen recently one night, his sister calls me and asks if I'm still his friend and if I'll go pick him up from jail as \"something happened\" and they towed his truck and put him in holding.  She asks if he can stay with me again but doesn't tell me where he is and doesn't return my call the next morning until 1pm when I'm already working...  Honestly?  I don't want to go pick him up.  He's got nowhere to stay so I know he wants to stay at my house.  He doesn't have a vehicle until he can get his it out so guess who is now giving him rides everywhere he's got to go?  I'm tired of the whole situation.  I've tried to help him in so many different ways and things don't really change.. he gets a job for two weeks and then calls and acts like everything is different now and he's in a better place and he's glad to be working.  Then he gets a check and doesn't go back to work.\n\nSo now he's asking me to lend him $425 to get his truck out.  Problem is I don't really have it.  He thinks I have it and I could force the money out but it's money for my bills and I'll have to make that back somehow and currently winter is on us - so work is slowing down a lot.  Usually in the winters I barely make rent for my home and the shop every month.  He swears he'll pay it back to me as soon as he sells everything that was in his truck when they took it etc.  \n\nSo my question is wtf do I do with this.. in general? Do I lend him the money and let him stay at my house again?  Right now he's in a rescue mission program after getting out of jail.  Am I a dick for not wanting to do that?  Or even deal with this anymore?  \n\nTLDR:  my neighbor growing up who has worn me out for help is asking for money to get his truck out of the tow lot.  He's a good guy but life took a shit on him in the past year or two in many ways. The money I have to lend him is for my rent, which is due in 10 days.  \n\nThere's a lot more to all of this.  But I don't want to write a short novel any more than I already have.  Maybe I'm just venting or asking for advice, I can't really tell, but feedback is appreciated.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She was going on how I never let her do the things that she wants and never take care of her or looked out for her whenever we are out. \n\nWhich is so not true and we actually do a lot of what she wants most of the time--such as going to the places she wants to shop at or going to the places she wants to eat. I never minded or was bothered by it because of her food allergies and dislike for a lot of cuisines. Her palate is pretty simple and there is nothing wrong with that. I never complained whenever she wanted to me to hang out with her wherever she wanted to go to.\n\nThe way she said those things really hurt me because it made me feel like I am not being a good friend toward her through the years. It was as if all the things that I did and do for her are just taken for granted and overlooked. Let alone, I have never really gone out as often as I did this year so of course there hasn't been many opportunities where I have been present with her when she's out drinking. \n\nIsn't taking her to a safe place to sober up and feel comfortable before heading home taking care of her? I was taken aback because I never thought she would say stuff like that even if she were tipsy/drunk. Now it makes me feel some restraint with going out for drinks with her and hanging out with her. I don't want to be a burden if that is how she really feels. Is it true that people do say what they truly think and feel when they are tipsy?

I graduated high school nearly 3 years ago and I\u2019m unemployed. I live with my grandparents and I have no friends left. I\u2019m trans and live in the south. No one here supports it. I look like a freak. I\u2019m tired of living, I\u2019m tired of trying. I leave the house maybe once every 3-6 months and my life has been put on an absolute standstill. All of my friends from high school are gone and married, joined the military, or are literally on the other side of the world, living in Europe and asia. My day to day life is always the fucking same. I wake up, pee, eat, go back to sleep. People say \u201coh you\u2019re just exaggerating no one has it that bad\u201d or \u201coh if you wanted to get out of there bad enough, you should just push through your emotions and grow the fuck up\u201d it\u2019s not that easy for me.\n\nMy entire family is extremely conservative, every single member cut me off except for my grandparents who misgender me on a daily basis and humiliate me at any chance they get. I\u2019m treated as a child rather than an adult who needs help getting out of the situation I\u2019m in. My grandparents have told me directly to my face that I belong in a mental institution simply because I hate my body. All of my friends have left me, my last friend and I effectively cut ties today because she has bipolar and has difficulty relating with people. She\u2019s also lacks any sort of ability to compromise or sympathize, or at VERY least doesn\u2019t know how to communicate with me effectively tho she would argue it\u2019s I who doesn\u2019t know how to communicate. We knew each other for 4 years(?) I don\u2019t remember if we met in \u201816 or \u201817 but I\u2019m sure if she\u2019s reading this, she\u2019ll know exactly who I am.

It kills my motivation to do anything at all. I just need someone who isn\u2019t afraid of cringe moments.

I am in desperate need of perspective and a course of action. I met a redditor online a year ago and we have grown tight! To save the innocent, let's call her Sydney. We are so tight, in fact that she has visited me in my hometown and is moving very soon! We are in touch with eachother through text and phone calls and know eachother's lives thoroughly and in minute detail.\n\nAs of recent, I know she is stressed out because her move is going to be difficult- new city, new friends, no family or contacts except me.  I helped her earlier with securing work, but she doesn't have a place to stay. I offered for her to stay with me until she gets situated, until she finds a place. I recently heard a horror story about how quickly a simple and nice offer can turn sour or into a squatters rights situation.  That can be awful.\n\n Now, I am not normally a very trusting person, and she seems trustworthy, but I am always steps ahead of the game.\n\nI had my real estate lawyer draft up a document that basically covers me, my lease, and my landlord in case Sydney doesn't move out or find a place in a reasonable period- 30 days. After 30 days, it gets harder in court to battle as squatters rights can take affect.  \n\nNow, I want my friend to feel welcome and I realize this document doesn't do that. Quite the opposite, actually.  I cannot afford to lose my apartment, nor will I put up with someone who won't move out. Any advice on how to present this document without it being a big deal? I feel like I am gifting her with 30 days free rent. I don't want her to feel unwelcome but I need to protect myself at all times.

{"post_id": "eagkmy", "created_utc": 1576306533, "title": "How to deal with a flaky friend?", "author": "LittleBunnyFrouFrou", "self_text": "I'm feeling glum and torn about an old friendship and would appreciate some advice or insight.\n\nMy best friendship of about 10 years (since college) is slowly dying. Since early college, we have never lived close by, but we have always maintained a very, very close friendship anyway (technology!!).\n\nWhen things are \"good,\" she is the best friend ever. She is generous, very giving, very loving, thoughtful, plus we have so much in common and just share an easy camaraderie. I can sit with her for hours and talk effortlessly about anything.\n\nBut the downside is: she can't handle bad or stressful times, and she flakes when any arise (all conveniently MY bad times...).\n\nExample: when I started dating my now husband, years ago, she would never ask about him, talk to me about him, let me gush, etc. For reference, she has always been a serial monogamist, and he was only my second serious boyfriend ever. I only say that for the context - I have always been used to (and supportive!!) listening to her go on and on about her dish of the week. When I finally met someone and wanted to have a bit of girl chat about him, she never showed any interest. She would change the subject. She acted weird. She would clam up. I just stopped bringing him up, and she was happy to keep talking about her own relationships.\n\n\nExample: I asked her to be MOH for my wedding a few years ago. This involved 0 planning or logistical responsibilities (no parties, nothing like that) - it was literally just a title and a low key expectation that she would help me scroll through Pinterest and tell me what flowers and dresses and stuff she liked. She accepted and within weeks started acting super strange whenever I brought up wedding planning (changing the subject, refusing to give her opinion [\"Blue or green?\" \"I DON'T KNOW, I'VE NEVER PLANNED A WEDDING BEFORE!\"]). Finally, she acted so miserable, and admitted that the \"stress and pressure were too much\" that I \"let her off the hook\" and asked another bridesmaid to take over. Original friend never looked happier and also never really talked about or showed interest in letting me talk about my wedding again.\n\nExample: my mother battled cancer for many years. We were extremely close, and I always told Friend that when my mom eventually passed (it was inevitable and known by everyone), I didn't know what I would do. That I would be a wreck, even if I knew it was coming. Well, guess what. My mom passed away this summer, and my friend said all the right things, was supportive of me... For about 2 weeks. And then, nothing. She disappeared. Disappearing is very common for her whenever things start to get too real. She usually complains that she can't handle the stress anymore and then goes into low key incommunicado mode. And this is what happens. She stops initiating conversations, she stops responding to text messages, she just peaces out.\n\nExample: I was 6 months pregnant when my mother died. I just had my baby (yesterday! Yay!) and Friend (who knew about pregnancy from the beginning) never said, did, asked anything. She was still incommunicado from my mother's death, so for the remaining 3-4 months of my pregnancy, there was nothing. Radio silence. She never called or texted or said, \"Hey, how are you handling things? Are you okay? How is the baby?\" And as my due date approached... Well, I don't even think she remembered my due date. I haven't even told her I had the baby (and I don't have social media and didn't plan to).\n\nThere was only one break in her imposed period of being incommunicado: in October, she briefly texted me to complain about her mother's recent visit to her city (mom cleaned her apartment, bossed her around, made Friend carry her luggage for her... Really bad stuff...) and inform me that she and her husband had been laid off. I happen to know they have plenty in savings, are adventurous travelers and travel as part of their living, and so I found that I couldn't even be sympathetic about that. I texted her back very shortly: \"sorry about losing your job\" and that was the last I have directly heard from her since.\n\nNow, I do use a small photo app to share baby photos (I also have a toddler) with very close friends and family. Maybe 10 people have access to it (Friend included). Suddenly, starting last week, she has gone back and left comments and \"liked\" a huge backlog of photos I have posted of my toddler. Her comments are all very peppy and upbeat and act like nothing is wrong. I think, for her, nothing is wrong.\n\nBut for me, I feel as if I've reached the end of my rope. I feel as though our relationship has always been uneven, and she has always taken more than she's given. I'm tired and hurt and don't see the point in making an effort to maintain our friendship when I feel like she doesn't make an effort for me - to maintain our friendship or even to ever just offer me as much of a shoulder as I feel I have offered her throughout the years.\n\nHere is my silly, overdramatic wish: I briefly wanted to delete her from my photo app without saying anything 1) to see if she would even notice and 2) because it bothers me that she can still have access to my daily life without even having to talk to me!\n\nBut I don't know what to do. Should I speak to her? I don't really want to. Am I being unreasonable? How can I approach this? Thank you for your help.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We instantly hit it off and immediately became really good friends and hung out after school almost every day and on the weekends. We were inseparable and I didn\u2019t have any issues with her. But slowly she started showing really toxic traits? She always needs the attention of every guy in the room. If it\u2019s on another girl, me or any of our other friends she seems to need it to be back on her, even if it isn\u2019t the attention of her boyfriend. She puts other people down all the time to be funny including me. She is so mean, and listen, I get best friends ratting on people they don\u2019t like together, but she will call girls she doesn\u2019t even know ugly all the time and constantly fat shames people? \nAgain, I\u2019m all for some dark humor but she takes it to a place that makes me feel like karma is going to get me. She also hangs out with our friends without me (at least as of recent) and it doesn\u2019t really bother me because I don\u2019t like it when they\u2019re all together, they are just really loud and stupid and I\u2019m not into that. But then if I hang out with one of our friends without her she seems really bothered by it and needs to know everything we did. She has also dated guys that my other friends have liked which sits with me the wrong way. \nAt this point, I know our friendship is nearing an end and I\u2019m going to college next year, but I don\u2019t know if I should completely cut her off or not? Here is the thing. Anytime I have really needed her she is ALWAYS there. Anytime I need to talk or need to rant she always listens and is super understanding. I know if I really needed her she would be there for me no matter what which is why this is hard. She is toxic yes, but she is also very understanding. I know I could tell her anything and she wouldn\u2019t judge me. When she went away for vacation she brought me back so much stuff and is always getting me stuff she thinks I will like. she makes me feel so bad so much though. I truly do love her but I feel like this isn\u2019t good for me anymore. I just don\u2019t want to lose the good parts of the friendship too because they really are good. Without her I know I would be so lonely but also I wouldn\u2019t feel so bad about myself all the time. It\u2019s confusing.

{"post_id": "eaip9z", "created_utc": 1576323077, "title": "27 m looking for a protege", "author": "Will_BC", "self_text": "Weird title I know, but I'll do my best to explain, starting with a condensed life story. \n\nFrom a young age I've been (more than) a bit eccentric. I had a few friends even before I started kindergarten, but as time went on I got along better with the adults around me. I excelled in school from the start, but by the time middle school hit I felt myself becoming more and more isolated from my peers. My parents had been long divorced by then, and I was raised by a single mother in relative poverty. But I maintained a degree of brightness in school, a home away from home. I was close to some of my teachers, surrogate parents, taking all the advanced classes on offer and a couple that were not, thanks to the mentorship of one of these for independent study. I achieved a 1560 on my SATs, but ended up at my safety school despite that. \n\nThe chip on my shoulder may have begun to develop at that time, but when I entered college I spent more time around people my age than I had for a long time, and more informally. I tried to make up for the high school parties I was never invited to, and found myself drinking heavily to compensate for the social anxiety I felt on that new ground. This trajectory did not end well for me, as my partying became more excessive but less fulfilling, culminating in a nervous break and a diagnosis of bipolar in my junior year. \n\nI dropped out at that time, and spent years in a deep and black depression that nearly claimed my life, struggling to adapt to the  psychotropic medications I was prescribed and reclaim some sense of my shattered identity. If my isolation was stark before in high school, now it was absolute. My outward activity was negligible, but inwardly there was a war raging. I scoured the internet for understanding and enlightenment, ranging from self help and cognitive science to esoteric political, religious, and philosophical writings.\n\nAfter years of therapy, a lot of introspection, and trial and error, I hope this story has a happy ending. My most recent therapist and newest psychiatrist think I've come a long way, and that that diagnosis may have even been an error. I'm being weaned off of my meds. I met the love of my life, and am in the faltering stages of forming my own family. I'm in the process of finally returning to school for a degree, and getting my head firmly riveted back on my shoulders. \n\nSo back to the title. I feel like my life has left me with some degree of hard to obtain understanding, and I'd like to share that with others. Maybe you're in the dark night of your own journey, maybe you're as lost as I was, maybe something I said sparked some kind of interest in you, maybe you're just bored and rudderless for this moment, but if you have any inclination to know more or just chat, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. We can traipse through the rabbit holes together, and have a blast doing it.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I\u2019d been telling her for a few years after they began their relationship that she needs to leave him because of the marks and bruises and for some reason i was unable to get her to open her eyes. she claimed dick was too bomb but that\u2019s neither here nor there. Anywho she has a child with him and moves in with him all while being physically and emotionally abused. She has cheated on him several times and he has too and i never once gave her an untilmatum or anything like that i just stuck by her to pick her up when he knocked her down. I bought her weapons and we would spar in her driveway lightly. like the whole 9 yards. she just can\u2019t leave him and i\u2019m not talking about small bruises i\u2019m talking about black eyes, busted capillaries, deep cuts on her face, he dragged her in the street by her hair once and left her there. I ended up moving to austria with my dad and came back around Dec last year. which is when my life went downhill. \n\nsince i was here i figured i would try to spend as much time with her as i possibly could because she was still living in his house. she told me how she felt trapped and scared for what he might do if she tried to leave. Meanwhile her and i develop a strange dynamic as if we were more than friends which is more than confusing for me because i thought and have been openly gay for years. I narrowed it down to just knowing her for so long that we just have a platonic close ass friendship but those thoughts still stay with me. \n\ni knew that if i was going to be there with her even when he was home i would have to try to build some sort of relationship with him because he\u2019s dumb asf so i didn\u2019t want him to think we were anything more than friends which we weren\u2019t physically but we had been sexting or whatever a few times this that and the third. So eventually his birthday rolls around and i was invited to the party. Firstly he was very openly homophobic but was the type of guy that snickers with his douche bag friends but puts up a front publicly to seem more like able. so he was making slight jabs at me. saying things only i would know to be offensive. for example a few of them were making a beer run and asked carlos what kind to get and he said \u201cnot michelob ultra that\u2019s that gay shit\u201d (how is beer sexualized idfk) i looked at emily and she knew he was sneak dissing because they both knew my favorite beer was mich we had a discussion about it the week prior. so me and her go inside the house to get away from them (keep in mind her infant son is in the bedroom asleep) so upon entering the kitchen another one of carlos\u2019 friends approached me but this one seemed more ragged. he had a prosthetic leg. the first thing he said to me was \u201cwhat do u want?\u201d as he was pulling out three baggies one had weed one had cocaine and the other crystal meth. i knew what they all looked like but i had only ever tried coke once and was a reg stoner so i had my own. wasn\u2019t interested and then he proceeded to pull a loaded pistol out his bag and told me \u201cshe\u2019s for sale too, no numbers\u201d all i could think was this meth head has a loaded gun in the house with a baby. eventually most of them leave including the two strippers that were there one being the bich he cheated on emily with. He had just purchased a new Dodge Ram and at this point i wanted to go home. Emily had picked me up so it was her responsibility to take me home. Her Carlos and I pile in his truck and we go to my house. \n\nAt my house we begin to drink liquor. like straight southern comfort. We get to talking about his truck and all the cool things it has to offer etc. he offers to let me test drive it, me being a fucking dunce decided yea let\u2019s all pile in and let me drive drunk in the rain with my best friend and carlos. thankfully they didn\u2019t bring her child. We maybe make it a mile and i lose control of the truck we go off the road and clip a concrete pipe that was connecting two ditches underneath the entrance to a residential neighborhood. Paramedics and investigators had on the report that the truck flipped at minimum 7 times. Emily was unbuckled but we all managed to make it out alive with only minor cuts and bruises. We were rushed to the hospital where i was tranquilized because of how manic i was being. I wake up to find out that emily and carlos had fled the hospital so they wouldn\u2019t need to answer any questions from police. i obviously go to jail after i was given the all good from the hospital and got out later the next day. \n\nThis is when shit hit the fan. Unbeknownst to me, Carlos had pressured emily into signing for the truck and promised to make the payments necessary to keep it. she stupidly did just that. so the $22k truck that was totaled to shit, she was monetarily responsible for. We start hanging out after we do the whole holy shit we\u2019re alive we were being stupid conversation and everything seemed to be normal. \n\nThe next week i was served with a lawsuit demanding $34k in conjunction with my insurance which consequently dropped me. She didn\u2019t ask me for monetary compensation didn\u2019t discuss any legal action. i was blindsided. so i call her and ask her about it and she claims her and carlos spoke with their insurance and the insurance company was suing me which was a total lie because insurance companies don\u2019t employ hawk law. After all legal stuff. they win the case i had to pay out $12k and my insurance paid $22k. I\u2019ve known her for 17 years and suddenly it was like she was a stranger. the best friend i knew would\u2019ve just asked me to help out monetarily or we would e discussed it somehow and came to a consensus. the best friend i knew would never sue me. \n\nFlash forward to now we\u2019ve had each other blocked on and off. when we talked it was mainly sexual or surfaced. can\u2019t hold a conversation with her anymore. I asked if she was still with carlos and i was told no because he had let another man move in because he was paying in meth. Emily asked to meet somewhere to talk so we did. that talk was awkward as that was the first time we\u2019d seen each other face to face since the lawsuit. she was emotional and said she loved me and could lose me and i basically said the same. She said she was living back with her parents and already had everything moved back. of course i believed her but that was another lie. \nHer sister and i still talk, i mean i grew up with her and her family so of course i still close with her family. Her sister messages me about a month ago saying that carlos and emily were fighting in the front yard. She said when she went out in the front yard Carlos was visibly drunk his car had door was open they are baby child was in his car seat and buckled Emily was in the process of trying to get her child out of the truck and Carlos better off and did a circle around the block with the door open and the baby on back order so her sister called the police Carlos ends up stopping the truck her sister and her mom are able to get the baby out of the car as they are Carlos gets out of the truck in tackles \u2764\ufe0fEmily\u2764\ufe0f in the front yard cut up her temples and her on right eyelid. The police show up and \u2764\ufe0fEmily\u2764\ufe0f decides to not press charges however considering the baby was involved charges were filed by the state Carlos was put on a restraining order to be in no physical contact with their child however I know now Emily has been going back to him with her child for weeks at a time. her sister said her body is changing she has all these open sores she\u2019s getting skinny and more bony looking she\u2019s just looking more unhealthy and to me that means Meth. so I thought that I would unblock her a few days ago to see what would happen and she messaged me asking if I wanted to meet in our neighborhood to smoke and I obliged and we met and she looks completely different she again claimed that she wasn\u2019t going to Carlos\u2018s house that they were done and I get a message from Christina yesterday saying that Emily told her not to tell me that she was at Carlos\u2018s. \n\nI guess my question to you all is what do I do from here do I let us go I don\u2019t see how this could be salvaged even if we have a long history. also am I insane for trying to keep her afloat? We have so much in common and we have such a long friendship it\u2019s hard for me to let go but I just can\u2019t associate with her when she is still fucking her abusive baby daddy and now she\u2019s on meth. it\u2019s so hard to see someone I love so much destroy themselves I feel helpless.\n\nmy other good friends who are aware of the situation tell me that I am too good that I should leave her alone never speak to her again and go about my life I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so difficult though. \n\nHow much is too much where do you draw the line for how much you\u2019re willing to forgive?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019ll do my best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoing poop. New poop. Not \u201cnew\u201d, aka \u201chuh, I haven\u2019t done this for AgEs\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNEW. Aka \u201cHoly Crabs for the love of Thor what the quack is ThIs!?.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoing poop which is completely outside of my comfort zone. What I\u2019ve never experienced before. Or at least not on such deep levels, because of my scared ass. Poop that makes me crap my pants while overfilling me with tremendous curiosity at the same time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the last 5-6 months I\u2019ve decided to say \u201cQuAcK yOu\u201d to my toxic masculinity and take a joke from one of my dearest amigos\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2026 \u201cHah, let\u2019s group up then and start a goddamn choreography group!\u201d \u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2026 waaay too seriously. We burned the parquet for 2 months straight. You know what\u2019s scarier than making your first dance move as a stereotypical, European, white, pseudo-macho-male rap fanatic? Doing it with witnesses. What\u2019s worse than that? Witnesses that are female. Can we go further? Apparently yes \u2013 while jumping into a choreography of a music type which I absolutely hated with all my heart. K-POP. Ok, that\u2019s it, right? We can\u2019t\u2026 WHILE choosing a K-POP choreo perfomed by four goddamn women. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s just sum it up to this \u2013 I\u2019ve got broken. Mentally annihilated. I\u2019ve never been so blown away from my comfort zone before. Ever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd never have I felt so damn alive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring those 5-6 months, after two months of dancing (we had to stop because 3 out of 4 members of our little dance group were leaving for university), I\u2019ve decided to go with the flow, use that weird knowledge and feeling that I\u2019ve experienced, and throw myself into even more discomfort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI revived my old fantasy projects from the childhood (mostly revolving around one, irrationally big worldbuilding project - an RPG). I\u2019ve bought Cubase and allowed myself to suck like the utter noob I was, and pretty much still am, while composing my first soundtrack ever. If you ever wondered, yes, after 68 seconds of feeling like a god on earth, you pretty much hate each and every bit of your song. Just like while drawing \u2013 shoutout to my fellow suffering artists o/\u2019\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used to go to sleep at 4 am, so I gave myself a retarded challenge of *waking up* at 4 am instead. I kicked my buttocks, but for some magical reason I feel more energized than ever. And bro is it marvelous to have some time for yourself in the morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve got back to sucking at wanna-be-a-character-artist, but now, with not giving a single duck about *if* I\u2019m bad at it, and focusing completely on *why* I don\u2019t understand very specific rules of lightning, composition, anatomy and dynamic poses. Don\u2019t get fooled though, I\u2019m still far from where I want to be, yet I\u2019m better than I ever was before, and that\u2019s what counts. And by the way, I ain\u2019t doing this for money anymore. Thankfully. I just want to create amazeball creatures for my fantasy world and fanarts for my favorite Overwatch characters. Nothing else matters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve also forced myself to reach out to an old childhood friend of mine, who also wanted to move his lazy buttocks, and we started out with regular workouts. I still don\u2019t completely understand why, but the bare pressure of potentially disappoint my buddy through not standing in from of the gym on the given day at the given time, made me appear there every single time. No excuses. Amazing. It\u2019s amazing how we can make fear our strongest weapon. Especially as introverts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve jumped into a bunch of other weird ideas. I pretty much decided to try an idea out before I think rationally about it. What a sweet decision it was. And still is. I\u2019ve forced myself to become more social. Sometimes it made me lose hope in humanity. Other times it made me understand how to meet up with fellow souls to not hate my existence while being outside of my room. I needed a ton of dots to actually connect them and understand. But I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s not about *where* you are. But *with whom*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s not about *what* you are doing. But *how* you are doing it. With what attitude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHoly Legolas, wait a second, because I\u2019m deviating from the topic like a thordamn pro.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Would you maybe want to gang up, become children again and just.. create, together? Make ourselves comfortable in being uncomfortable while trying the weirdest poop we always wanted to try? \n\nWant to draw, compose, write and read, or create in whatever way you want to, together, from time to time, or during some fixed schedules, while sharing our doubts, artblocks, tips and tricks, while breaking down what we want to understand and how to understand it? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWant to banter about the this 2 seconds of Flume\u2019s song, while challenging ourselves to remake it 1:1, while failing quacking hard? \n\n&gt;I\u2019m currently addictively inspired by DROELOE, Flume &amp; Son Lux from the sound design perspective, divinely lyrically enlightened by EMINEM and Bitamina (rather unknown outside of Poland), absolutely, utterly shattered and in love with Florence Welch and when it comes to moods and telling a story through rhythms - Hans Zimmer is life.

Oh, and the yet-unread Lord of the Rings Trilogy, although my broken English accent would probably collapse under some of the words inscribed by this old bastard. Not to mention your innocent ears. I\u2019m also eager to buy the original, English version of any of Brandon Sanderson books. I\u2019d absolutely love to reread \u201cThe Way of Kings\u201d. We could also jump into some biographies. Or rom-coms. Or self-improvement books (I hate them, I\u2019m learning much more in this matter through self-reflections and from podcasts such as Joe Rogan, but \u2013 just so you know, that I\u2019m eager to jump outside my box).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Big plus if you are a fellow Polish comrade (yup, kurwa ma\u0107 etc.), since then we will have a much bigger variety of books, which I\u2019d love to reread or read of the first time ever (for example the whole Witcher Saga, which I\u2019d never dare to read in English, since that\u2019s pure heresy). I\u2019m also open for any recommendation of yours.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We would have yet another ton of stuff to rant about with such mutual adventures in our backpacks of memories. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWanna learn how to take a break, call each other on discord and go for a walk in the woods?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWant to start learning how to be human, take the first steps into meditation, take care of your body and start working out, put this puzzle which is your mind into a slightly less chaotic form, get rid of those fears that keep you up at night, get your diet together, stop napping through the whole Saturday or start with complete baby steps like taking a shower every single day (depression is a snitch), start knitting, break your high score of talking 87 words per year, finally finish (not write it perfectly, *finish*) your short story, jump into breakdancing, breaking your toxic masculinity and jump into ballet dancing or you crave for improving your diction, accent, or English, or Polish, and need a bro to keep your flow?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhatever you\u2019d be up to. Let\u2019s be uncomfortable together. Let\u2019s break our shells and grow into ways we\u2019ve never even imagined before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Oh, and boy oh boy, let\u2019s also make some crazy excuses... \n\n... and spend a whole evening binge watching Avatar \u201cfOr sOmE InsPirAtiOn\u201d, playing Overwatch \u201cbEcAuSe I nEed It fOr a project mOoOm\u201d and deep dive into breaking down every single sentence of Brandon Sanderson\u2019s books to understand how the hell did this bastard make us feel so many emotions with just a plain combinations of words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime to get dirty, nourish our brains and make some love to this crazy multiverse you always wanted to bring to life.

Bro. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s spark up the inner child and nourish all this ideas and dreams that we let dry out or let\u2019s create entirely new ideas. Step after step. Learn new skills. Let\u2019s shit on our self-doubt. We don\u2019t need to blow up, but we do need to create and share what rumbles within us. Creation for the sake of it. Not everyone needs to understand our amazeballness. We will. \n\n\\* UuUuUltra Hive Five! \\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon\u2019t have a passion that\u2019s occupying your mind? Sweet. I kind of envy you. So many tastes you\u2019ve yet to taste. Then let\u2019s develop your passion. Don\u2019t trap yourself into this \u201cfind your passion\u201d bullpoop. We will create it instead. We will create our passions, while trying out character design, songwriting, worldbuilding, animation or whatever smells the nicest for us this week. And digging deep into what we chose. Within our own tempo. No pressure. No expectations. Well, maybe just a little pressure, just to keep our fire burning, hah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd let\u2019s never, EVER, get serious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, let\u2019s work hard. But also, especially, smart. And being stressed, too serious, with a stick up your ass, with no place for humor, friendly banter and not allowing yourself to chill \u2013 there is no \u201csmart\u201d in that. That\u2019s how burnouts and art blocks are crafted. So, bro or sis, let\u2019s, most importantly, keep each other in check. No problem can\u2019t be turned into a fun, exciting challenge. Let\u2019s be vulnerable. Let\u2019s share our worries and achievements. And let\u2019s *play* hard and enjoy ourselves like the beautiful mthrfkrs we are. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing lazy is great. But have you tried being lazy after a bloody epic fight inside the realms of your passion? Aaaw yeeeeah. Indescribable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most paradoxical thing is \u2013 even resting is more epic than before. I mean, even something as brainless as taking a dump. Suddenly, when you do it after a big workout, after a deadly match of HEMA, after finally owning those 2 seconds of a choreography, or after working your brain out while creating the sickest beat you ever created \u2013 suddenly, even your crap glitters with gold. I mean, taking a dump is one of my favorite things during the day and it turns out I can do this *better*!? I\u2019m in. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going back. That\u2019s too much joy to miss out on. Discipline, the brute force of our mind, is breathtaking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to know the tiniest details about what you dreams and what you crave for and on what exact areas of your life do you want to work on in the next weeks. Write me an essay, bro. Oh, and by the way.\n\nNot necessarily men \u2013 \u201cBro\u201d is a legendary, unisex badge of honor and glooory.   \n \n\n\\* EpIc-UlTrA-lEgEndArY hIgh FIvE! \\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Oh, and please, don't get fooled by my joyful attitude right now!\n\nI'm a fellow human, just like you.\n\nI get scared, frustrated, paralyzed, stunned, overfilled with joy, overwhelmed, crying from laughter, crying from pain, bursting from anger and blazing with hope and inspiration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe don\u2018t need to laugh our bellies out to enjoy what we do together. There are some many more colors to feel and enjoy. The seriousness in our eyes when we look at each other in Battlefield, rushing like crazy to revive our fallen sister in arms. Being touched by the incredible talk of Lord Gnugbar, after we finish his quest in Divinity 2. The sheer terror and fear when we pierce ourselves into the enemy team in Overwatch, executing our impossible strategy which we just made up on spot. The love and huge crush on our Roadhog, who once again, with his fine belly, saved our asses from complete annihilation. Every emotion is worth feeling. And most importantly, there is something I needed way too much time to understand \u2013 you don\u2019t need to smile, to be happy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a terrible memory and often forget about it, but hey, that\u2019s why we will have each other.

He's very quiet and doesn't engage in much of a conversation.  I'm in my second year at university and we are neighbors in our block of flats on campus. I know a lot about social anxiety and I don't think he has social anxiety because he does not avoid things and doesn't get hot/sweaty etc, and he can become argumentive...\n\nWhen he does engage, it usually comes across as rude and even critical. In fact, the more I've thought about it, the more it comes apparent to me that when we talk he is only criticizing me or even being rude or being hostile.\n\nFor example, whenever I made a mistake, he will comment on it.  I'm a very positive person and even when I've complimented him, he's looked at the issues.\n\nFor example, in a presentation we did as a team recently, he barely added anything to the powerpoint slides in the prep. He only looked over my shoulder and whenever I made a typo, he would quickly comment on it. It doesn't feel much of a friendship, but more of a nasty shadow over me at the moment. I added a ton of details to the powerpoint and made it look nice with GIFs. Unfortunately, there was a slight error during the presentation with the GIFs seemingly lagging the presentation - my friend smartly thought of a solution that fixed it during the presentation. I complimented him for this, for his quick thinking. I thought it is good to compliment someone who is quiet and thought of a good solution. \n\nBut after afterward me complimenting him, he would go start to on about my GIFs and \"no thanks to you...all those GIFs...\" (this was not done or said in a jokey way or manner, it felt very rude and hostile.. I'm very confused; when you compliment someone for doing someone thing.\n\nEarlier today, I was upset over something and spoke to him, and he sided with a complete stranger by saying \"yeah, you should be sorry and then XYZ..\"  \n\nI'm trying to work out the person in front of me.\n\nIs it possible he has a specific type of social personality? I would struggle to ask him such a question because a) I don't want to come across as rude b) I do not know pretty much anything about him on a personal level since he keeps to himself a lot...\n\nThank you for your support in advance\n\nKind regards,\n\nDom", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm always the one to ask to hang out.", "author": "SevereCherry", "self_text": "I'm a freshman in college and I'm lucky enough to be going to school with my best friend. Her boyfriend is at the school too and I consider him to be a great friend of mine as well. Recently, I've been feeling that neither of them wants me around. In the beginning of the school year, one of them would text me so we could all meet and have dinner, now, it's always me asking. I don't really have other friends at my college and it has been hard for me to find someone that I could trust, so I basically hang out with my two friends every day. I think I'm just an overly attached person and I'm an ambivert, so I get very happy to be with my friends. I enjoy their company a lot. Being alone is not a good thing for me because as a depressed person, I'm constantly thinking about how much I hate myself. Being with my friends brings me happiness and it's an escape from my extremely negative thoughts. My best friend hasn't been asking me to hang out in a while. If I ask her to hang out, she will say yes, but we would have to hang out hours after the initial text. It's frustrating to think that I'm asking for an appointment to hang out with her. I sometimes feel that she hangs out with me out of pity because she knows how lonely I am. I know she loves me, but I'm worrying that I'm bothering her by asking to hang out every single day. She always says that she enjoys my company, but I'm worried that she's afraid to hurt my feelings. I understand that she's in a relationship, so I try to tell myself that I'm not her only priority, but I still feel slightly upset that she chooses to spend all of her free time with him and not invite me. In high school, the three of us were able to hang out as a group, but now she spends nearly all of her time with him. If I could, I would love to spend the entire day with her because, again, she is my best friend, but I feel that she definitely won't want that.

How do I tell her she\u2019s not staying at my place again next time they travel?", "author": "chriskuva", "self_text": "Earlier this year, my best friend and his girlfriend came to visit me in LA and stay for 10 days. They live in Florida, I live in California - an awesome trip to take for sure! I\u2019ve known my best friend for 10 years and I\u2019ve met his girlfriend a few times; they\u2019ve been together for 2 years. \n\nHe\u2019s visited me in California a few times before but he wanted to visit again with his gf. I obviously offered my apartment for them to stay for free and I drove them around LA all 10 days. They paid for my gas and some of my meals but that\u2019s it. Which is what we agreed on so it\u2019s fine. \n\nHowever, his girlfriend... I\u2019ve never spent more than 4 hours at a time with the both of them together so it\u2019s not like I know what she\u2019s REALLY like. \n\nOn this trip, she loved to complain. I would drive them both through the horrendous LA traffic to go to scenic areas that me and my friend have already been, and to be honest I wouldn\u2019t be going if it wasn\u2019t for them. Hollywood, Venice beach, Downtown LA; it\u2019s cool but it\u2019s chaotic which is why I don\u2019t go unless I have to. \n\nOne example of her complaining was I drove through 45 minutes of traffic to get to the famous part of Hollywood, \u201cSunset Blvd\u201d - and of course there was tons of traffic and tons of tourists walking the streets. I said \u201cokay I\u2019m going to park so we can all walk around and check Hollywood out\u201d, she said she doesn\u2019t want to get out. (I\u2019m driving, she\u2019s in the back seat, my best friend is in the front passenger seat) and she\u2019s looking down at her phone as I turn around and ask her why she doesn\u2019t want to get out. She avoids eye contact with me as she says \u201cshe doesn\u2019t want to be in crowds\u201d (she\u2019s from Miami, there\u2019s plenty of crowds there) - I was appalled by that answer and I said \u201cif you don\u2019t want to be in crowds, you should\u2019ve just visited Idaho\u201d  - the car was quiet. \n\nI was very upset. I don\u2019t have to drive her, I don\u2019t have to put up with the stress of traffic or energy for that matter and she comes with this dumb excuse. I park the car anyway and we get out to walk sunset Blvd. like i said, I\u2019ve done this tourist attraction well over ten times. \n\nThere were other situations. Like we went to Venice beach and my friend insisted she takes a photo by a landmark and she says no. He insists again 5 min later and she comes with attitude to her boyfriend (my best friend)... \u201cif it makes you feel better, I\u2019ll take a pic of this palm tree\u201d - I held in my anger. The palm tree is obviously not the landmark and she comes out with this b**ch attitude and sarcasm. \n\nOther times include her saying I AM annoying and complaining about food options. It was 10 days of this and I honestly wish she didn\u2019t come. I want my friend to visit, I know how much he loves LA. She wanted to visit soooo bad but 80% of the time she was complaining about me or about traffic, crowds, food, or other people in LA who did nothing to her. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing. I visit them every Christmas because I was raised in Orlando FL and that\u2019s where they live. So when I go to see my family I also visit my friend who lives with his girlfriend. I know for a fact it\u2019s going to come up \u201cI want to visit LA again...\u201d but I\u2019ve already made the mental note that if he visits with HER again, they are NOT staying with me. If he visits alone, that\u2019s different, he\u2019s my friend of 10 years. I don\u2019t give a rats ass about her. So if they visit LA together, they\u2019re going to have to find a hotel or Airbnb. \n\nBUT how do I say that without bringing tension in the air? It\u2019s like I want to be a smart ass about it but I know I shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m 29, he\u2019s 33 and she\u2019s 27. We\u2019re all adults here but I feel like she has the brain of a teenager sometimes. I just felt like she was so ungrateful.\n\nWhat would you do? \n\n**btw, opening my doors for them to stay for free is a HUGE benefit to them (obviously). But they both work part time at Starbucks and some other job for a little extra cash (it\u2019s not much) so together, they would have to save for yearsss before they can afford a hotel room and a rental car in LA for 10-14 days.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I took him up on the offer. He was a tad tipsy but even when it wore off he was totally down. Or maybe he was still drunk? Hard to tell since he does cocaine and whatnot. Not sure if that makes you just SEEM less drunk or actually less drunk. Anyway \u2026 when we got to the motel he went STRAIGHT to sex. No foreplay or anything. He even took out his penis because I wasn\u2019t warming up to him. I need foreplay first and all of them engage in foreplay before sex but whatever. He got little to nothing that night. I was so turned off. I was mad at him for a bit. Then we talked it over. He hung out again. He was slightly awkward when we did hang out  though. He seemed nervous and kept accidentally on purpose touching my shoulder. He brought his friend and told him not to spook me. I waited in the car with his friend for awhile. He took a bit long changing up buuut he did just get off of work so was dirty. I didn\u2019t agree to hang out with his friend last time because I didn\u2019t know him well enough and was scared something might happen.  Anyway \u2026 planning a meet up with him in advance never works out (buut when I was doing that he kept going in and out of prison so that\u2019s probably why.) Anyway, someone told me it\u2019s sketchy that he\u2019ll invite me to his friend\u2019s birthday party out of the blue and that time he invited me to some Labor Day party out of the blue is sketchy as well. Again, those events were planned in advance then he had to cancel. Does it really sound that sketchy, like he\u2019s plotting to get me drunk and take advantage of me? He had bought me drinks at the bar. And we have drank together before. I also had a difficult time in the motel with him because I was sexually abused when I was little. After I told him that he wasn\u2019t as pushy so that\u2019s a good sign. But anyway \u2026 yeah is his behavior really that sketchy? Our plans worked out better when it wasn\u2019t planned in Advance and he probs didn\u2019t wanna hang out all of the time because he felt my location was further from him than it really was and his dad didn\u2019t allow guests over (I can only imagine what happened. He gets drunk and obnoxious sometimes plus he has had major issues with his dad but he was king enough to take him back in when he was homeless)  and I was living with my parents before he grew distant (probably the arrests? He lied to me about why he couldn\u2019t reply when he was actually in prison).  But anyway \u2026 Yeah does it really  sound like he was plotting on hurting me?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Which bring me to my next nerdy topic thing, I like alternative history, for the same reason. The butterfly effect is fascinating to me and it\u2019s crazy to me how one simple action can change history drastically. The same way as if you were to launch a projectile and just change it\u2019s initial trajectory just by a single degree or two and by the time it stops it will be potentially miles off of what the target was, depending on how far it travels.

I really might find it hard to not come across as whiney or rude, and this whole post will be messy in terms of structure.\n\nTo put it simply, over the last couple of months I feel like I've become less and less important to people and more irrelevant in general. Not being invited to most parties or gatherings is the best example of this. I dont want to get into the nitty gritty but there's a house party coming up, around 50 people coming which includes all my friends, but i didnt get invited. I spoke to the host and she said \"So so sorry but i just have too many numbers and parents would be mad :(\".\n\nNormally I can move on and accept this as I used to have this \"Oh well, nothing i can really do about it i guess\" sort of thinking. But after missing out on the past 3 or more social events im starting to really sink into a self-destrcutive depressive state and im really worried for my mental health. I know for a fact that if i could just come to this party i would instantly feel better. One of my friends who was going tried his best to plead for me to come (considering every single one of my mates are already invited) but she kind of played it passive and said \"Ill see what i can do\"\n\nI feel like that is basically just a delayed rejection. What can i do to get her to say yes? I mean i just cant see how ONE more is at all a big deal in the grand scheme.

Up until maybe 3rd year college i was still fine and was still my charming, bubbly self. My senior year college really opened my eyes to what kind of a person I was and all that, and to make things shorter, I realized how unhappy I was with a lot of things that I\u2019ve just been tolerating. One realization was that I put everyone else before me. If there was a bad situation, it was less of how does this affect me and what am I going to do about it, but more of how does this affect the others involved and how do I make it easier for them? Which is a good thing, but i have discovered so much anxiety from this being an accepted norm in my life. These thoughts, and many other similar thoughts have been negatively affecting my life recently and it\u2019s so sad to me. \n\n\nAnother thing to mention is that I met a girl in junior year and started dating senior year. She is so lovely, the first person I met that i call a role model in the way she lived and loved life, among many others. I mention her because she was the first I felt comfortable enough to open up about depression in college, and negative thoughts because in my friend groups I was always the moodmaker, and I was positive and never wanted to show emotional weakness because mood is contagious. It was not the first time I had someone on my side, but it was the first time I felt it truly, like she hit me with a hammer that says I care for you. She left me for an ex that she never got closure with this summer. It was absolutely devastating but I let her go. My biggest regret in life is not asking her to stay, I encouraged her to find happiness even if it\u2019s not me. \n\nI have stopped talking to a lot of people, only talking to close friends on discord. I dread socializing although the old me made friends everywhere I went. I have opened up to two of my closest friends, one I met in college and one from high school.

It wasn\u2019t too hard to open up initially, but whenever I have a bad day and I want to talk to them, it feels like I\u2019m intruding on their happy lives. My college friend told me she\u2019ll always be there but i know she\u2019s going through some hard times mentally as well. I cannot bring myself to make her worry about me by sending her my saddest thoughts written out. With my high school friend, I feel he is kinda like running away from the sadness because he experienced heartbreak early. We understand each other well, but doesn\u2019t do well comforting people, I suspect because it reminds him of sadness. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this has been a longer post than I wanted, but it is also just the surface of what\u2019s what. I am writing this at ~5:30am local time because i can\u2019t bring myself to sleep and because I am so desperately in need of some comfort, a friend. I have lost all confidence and emotional fortitude that used to be my strengths. I am so anxious and my mom always comments about my hand shaking. I am so lost in what love means, and I lack the energy to do anything now. On top of everything, it is the worst time to be so low functioning, since I am in the process of preparing for jobs I feel I\u2019m not worthy of. \n\nI know it gets better, and I know better days are coming, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll make it there in one piece mentally, and it\u2019s so lonely doing this by myself. It was so much easier with you next to me. I feel less and less myself everyday. I hate being sensitive. Despite all this will someone be my friend? Goodnight now.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Throughout university, we met up sometime and talk sometimes. Kinda drift apart. This year few of our high school friends start talk more and hang out more. So me, 'a' and 'b' decided to hangout at least once a month.\nAnd if other from our high school want to joy, we are gladly welcome as the propose was to get all of us together but it end up with 3 of us who always can come. So we grow closer since we can talk about life and work now.\n\n'A' tend to talk really forward sometime with a blunt word. So I know this is her habit, tend to not thinking much over her words but what happened today kinda stung.\n\nWe were having seafood and we ordered 4 dishes to share. The shrimp dish come with 5 shrimps, we had 1 each and I ate 2 since they eat a lot of other dish more than me so I thinking it was alright. \n\nThat was until 'b' ask why 1 shrimp left.\nSo I joked 'that's your missed! But I left one for you' \nAnd 'a' was like 'it's not a miss, it's called a manner' \nI didn't hear it correctly at first so I was like 'what?' and she didn't said anything more.\n\nSince it kinda hurt, I didn't rebut and she said it with serious face, I know she mean it. If it was in a less serious situation,  I probably be like 'well you already ate other dishes more than me!'\n\nAnd when it sink in, I just lost my appetite and barely eat anything. I pretend to be on my phone because I don't want to talk to her at that moment. I mean why such a harsh word over 1 shrimp? Should I cut it up? But it like just 2 bite size. Ugh\n\nThey end up eat more of the dishes then 'b' ask why I eat so little? So I said that the food is just not my taste.\n\nSo I kept quite and busy on my phone for a while, don't know if she noticed since at the end of the meal, I talked to her still. And during the way back, we visited a cafe, so we talked and we just talk less.\n\nIt kinda annoy me, that my brain can't stop repeat the incident and it make me feel really down now.\nMy overthinking habit is not something I enjoy.\n\nI probably gonna talk to her less for a while until I felt better.\n\nThis happened before with another friend,  said something kinda hurt but she is the type to said thing more thoughtlessly and kinda less serious. \nI just talked to her less for a while and met up with her fine after some distance to heal myself. \n\nWith this 'a' friend,incident like this happened from time to time.\nSo I feel like I should avoid taking a trip with her unless there's many people come along.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She made several stories talking about how to cut toxic people from your life and I know she was talking about me. The thing is I don't think I am toxic at all! Our friendship has been pretty much over for a month or two(which I'm sad about since she was the only close friend I had) and she was the one ending the friendship, justifying her distance saying 'she had nothing to say to me, and she had she would contact me' ( being relegated as acquaintance hurt me quite a lot)\n\nShe pretty much just distanced herself, while I constantly asked about going out or simply how she was (to which she answered hours or a day later). I knew there was something going on at this point, and when we finally met in person she accused me, in her opinion, that I was never interested in her life, of never asking about her (which is not true), even bringing up an outing of a few months back in which I didn't ask about how she was or about her boyfriend! (In my opinion, keeping tabs is kind of weird) Honestly, I don't really remember asking her, so she could be right, but then again I don't pay attention to this sort of things. I don't do it on purpose, it's not like I'm thinking 'I'm only going to talk about myself', I really don't realize!  \n\nAnyway, I know I'm not a perfect friend (who is?); I'm not the best at keeping in contact or even proposing outings(I know it's one of my problems) but we're adults with our own lives, we can't be talking every single day like when we were teenagers, I think it's normal when you've been friends for a long time. Friendship (and relationships in general) just evolve over time, doesn't mean we're not friends if we don't talk every single day. At least I see it this way. I was always available to listen to her problems, just talk and watch a movie together, going to an event, whatever. \n\nNow I have to admit I've been going through a depressive episode recently, so I might have been more distant, but I've actually opened up about it with her and told her I was sorry I couldn't be more present! (she's a psychology student). I thought she could understand me but in her eyes, I  think I was only using her for advice and never asked her questions about her own life! \n\nI'm not trying to salvage this friendship, but now I'm terrified. Am I just a horrible 'toxic' person that only talks about herself and doesn't even realize it? \n\n(Sorry If my thoughts are not well organized, English is not my first language)", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Here they realized they didn't have boundaries or prioritize their needs and instead prioritized (what they thought) were my needs, which were their own projections of what my needs were. They realized they routinely fall into friendships like this and saw me as a lifeline. I did not see them as intensely, I saw them as my best friend and someone who would walk me down the aisle one day, as like a flower girl or some shit like that.  \n\n\nI get this and I'm glad they are taking care of themselves but the way they communicated it to me was fucking awful. We have always had very different ways\\* of self-regulating and communicating and this conflict brought it all to the surface (we've had conflicts before but never like this).   \n\n\n\\*I need shit to be vocalized, ESPECIALLY if it has to do with me and my relationships. They isolate and ponder until they are ready to share. It appears to me that they didn't realize that just because it's their \\~spiritual awakening\\~ doesn't mean i don't have a part in it/it doesn't affect me. Like, they straight up shared with me that our relationship and my being was a huge part of their retreat. Like dude, that has to do with me and our relationship. I'd appreciate being kept in the loop about if you fuck with me or not.  \n\n\nThey, let's say uhhh, Priscilla, returned from their retreat, told me they had a lot to process, and just didn't talk to me for weeks straight and then claimed I was avoiding them. It was like they built a big wall.  We had a talk where they shared a lot of stuff from their retreat and I shared my feelings but it was pretty surface level. We shakingly reconciled and the next day was Yom Kippur and Priscilla texted me saying they hope I can forgive all that they've done. This was way too soon and put this pressure on me to forgive them. Also from my understanding, Yom Kippur is about self-forgiveness not about other people forgiving you.   \n\n\nSo i said, \"thanks for the apology. Going forward we need to express our truths and also keep each other's triggers in mind as to not overcomplicate and exacerbate the conflict\" \\[we've both been in some pretty fucked situations\\] or something along those lines. They said \"okay but my priority is myself\" which was just a weird response because that's already implicit. Like me fucking too dude. I can take care of myself without strumming your triggers like a guitar.  \n\n\nEventually Priscilla came home and was on a rampage of some sort, accusing me of projecting all this shit onto them and eventually hit my biggest chord, or trigger, to tie it back to the text. They weren't fully wrong on things I projected onto them, what was infuriating is that since Priscilla returned from the retreat, they can't see how fucked up they are being and how much they are projecting onto me.   \n\n\nPriscilla spoke about me like they were in my brain. They said that I need to know everything, which was what blew my fuse. I said \"I don't\" and they snarkily said \"Do you?\" and I just babbled crying and told them to get out. \\[a really big fear of mine is being \"too much\" , sensitive, loving, needy, etc.\\] so they made me feel like I was too much for wanting an update on whether or not we were even fucking friends or whatever   \n\n\nPost argument and wailing in our respective rooms, I wrote them a letter talking about why what they said was so infuriating. We talked, again a shallow reconciliation. Since that point, I have been focusing on myself and it has been great. Eventually, they approached me and I shared all of my issues with what happened and it seemed to be settled. Nope. Shit just keeps getting weirder.  \n\n\nWe don't hang out anymore or talk really. I do not have a friend in them. I have no desire to share my life with them and am growing resentful of their dirty dishes and general demeanor. I no longer have these rosy bff glasses on.  \nYesterday for one of their finals, they made an installation in an empty dorm with a bunch of stuff they want to leave behind. Some of these items included gifts and drawings I gade them, things we bought together. Shit like that. That fucking hurt, it was such an explicit view of them being done with me. Which would be easier if we didn't fucking live together.  \nAnyway. Back to the present--- kind of. Before this whole conflict, we made a plan for new years with 3 friends. This plan involved 99 dollars that I cannot get back. Priscilla and two of these friends are like hardcore stans and I don't have much tolerance for it but whatever, that low tolerance was more tolerable when I actually felt comfortable around Priscilla.  \n\n\nI asked Priscilla how they're feeling about NYe and they said they are not going to focus on the weirdness between us. Alright, glad you can compartmentalize. They are also much closer with these 3 friends than i am since I just met them over the summer. Anyway, I have been feeling this lack of excitement for this trip for like a month now and it is just not getting any better. I don't know if anything BAD is going to happen, but I'm sure awkwardness will ensue.   \nI'm already going to be in the area so I may as well go, and I can't get my 99 bucks back. Does anyone have any advice on how to fuckin tolerate this shit?  \nTLDR; my longtime best friend went on a spiritual retreat, rearranged their whole life, didn't talk to me about it, claimed I was avoiding them, and then said I was being too invasive because I wanted to know where we stood. We are not in good standing right now. We have plans for NYE with some Stans (lol) and I cannot get my money back so I'm going. Plz help me make this trip tolerable", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

And my friend is in that group too. So during the break we were playing around, she started playfully hitting me, and then she slapped me. I know she didn't do it to hurt me, but I kind of hurt. But that wasn't the problem. The problem was the little feeling I had in my cheek after she slapped me. It reminded me of my abusive father and the way he slapped me (among other things). I started tearing up, but I didn't want to cry there. Usually when I'm like this I don't talk because I can't control the crying afterwards. I told her not to touch me but she did, so I stayed quiet. My friend kept on talking to me. I didn't say a thing. She then got upset and started telling me that she has reasons to be upset with me too and she can be too if she wanted. I told her to do what she wants and that I wasn't feeling well. She told me I was selfish and only my emotions mattered to me. I told her I wasn't feeling well again, then I went to the bathroom and cried. When I came back I went to her and told her I wasn't mad at her. She interrupted me saying I was selfish again. I told her that she was selfish to assume all my problems were about her. She told me she was tired of toxic people in her life and that I only cared about myself. I left her alone and I went to hang out with my other friends. I figured she would come around, especially because we had to meet with another girl. (this has been planned for a week). She didn't. After we finished dancing I wanted to talk to her but she stormed off, and I apologised to the other girl we were supposed to meet with. This is not the first time she explodes, but it was never this bad. We both have problems, she has anxiety and I have depression, but I can't help but be mad at her for this.

For example, she asked me to go somewhere with her which would be like \u00a330 something for a train journey and I couldn't get a lift there either, my family was quite tight on money at this point - it was litterally eat for the week or go out (I didn't tell her this, I was embraced to) but before I got the chance to say anything, she called me a 'lazy fucking bitch' for it. Another example is her constantly threatening to kick me out of our DnD group (which is run by her dad) everytime we get into a little flight, even just whether or not you can play a card in uno or something. She also has this thing where she's 'brutally kind', like you ask her how your hair looks and she'll say it's fucking ugly, for example. \n\nSome other kind of little things. She's started to lick people, yeah, *lick* people recently and it's absolutely disgusting. She's also copying my other friend who's colour blind -  kind of. She writes in multiple colours saying 'I can't read the rest' but she only started doing this in the past 6 months maybe? Along with that, she also denies that my friend actually is colour blind constantly too. \n\nI don't want to be friends  with her anymore, I've had enough of her shit, but I'm just scared because she's friends with all of mine and she could turn them against me or something. She also knows a lot of my secrets and I don't know what I'd do if they got out. \n.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

He\u2019s the only person I really have left in my life since I\u2019ve cut off everyone else due to some pretty bad stuff going on in my life right now, and nobody in real life seems to understand me and doesn\u2019t care about what I have to say. We've been talking for a while about meeting up sometime and hanging out for a few hours or even a day, maybe next year. He\u2019s helped me through some tough times and situations and I\u2019ve helped him through his - I doubt I would still be alive today if it wasn\u2019t for him. We both trust each other and we've been on calls together so I'm pretty sure everything is safe. I've read up online about other people meeting online friends and everything has gone smoothly with no issues at all, and I'm pretty confident that that will be the case for me too.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure how to ask my mom if I can meet him. I'm pretty certain that she knows that I am friends with him, but I still don't just want to ask her directly if I can meet him - I need ideas of how I can indirectly meet him (eg. not just going away for the purpose of meeting up, maybe something like a convention or sightseeing). I\u2019ve spoken to my mom about my online friends before and she treats them like normal, real world friends which I guess is a +1 in this situation. My cousin (17F) has met up with her online friends before, and my mom has 100% thought it was a great idea (and paid for her flights to a different city to meet them), and everything went smoothly when they met up. The only huge issue which I can see being presented at the moment is that my friend lives in Finland, and I live in the UK which makes it very difficult to meet, and also expensive. I'm willing to pay for flights and hotel to meet him so that might convince my mom that I am mature enough.\n\nSo yeah, in conclusion, I'd be really grateful if some people could give me some ideas of how I could ask my mom to meet up instead of just randomly asking \"hey, can I meet one of my online friends?\u201d in the middle of a conversation.\nIf anyone could help me think of some ideas I\u2019d appreciate it a lot.

(They used to be close friends but we've just drifted apart over the years, and most of our ideals are no longer aligned. We just meet a couple of times every year for old times sake)\n\nFast forward to today, 4 days before the meetup, 1st friend was asking in the group chat if we were getting gifts for each other as she had forgotten if we were giving or not. 2nd friend said that we already said no presents. Shocker. And in a lighthearted reply, i said we agreed no presents for the kids only and that I already bought them something. 2nd friend then replied that's fine too. Then 3rd one digressed to something else, and then brought back the topic with \"so we are getting something for each other then?\". 1st friend says \"guess so since xxx (me) already bought haha\".\n\nSo this is where my blood pressure started elevating, because, not one not two, but all three of them were of the opinion tat we weren't buying any presents for each other. To be honest, I wouldn't have gotten anything for them if it was not suggested in the first place, and in our earlier chat weeks ago, 3rd friend was also asking if we were also getting presents for the kids and I said no, which i gathered now that's probably where they all thought no presents for the adults too (but it was specifically mentioned no for kids). Secondly, if you already read that I've gotten something, just probably go along with it instead of giving such curt remarks, I really didn't appreciate that.\n\nI told them that I'm surprised no one remembered,  showed them the text bout no presents for kids, and said that if no one had suggested in the first place, I wouldn't have gotten anything. And since no one had gotten anything, I can just use the presents myself, no need to trouble them to buy anything. To which they probably sensed my annoyance and were saying things like \"let's exchange presents!\" or \"actually I did buy some small things\". Right.\n\nAfter that I didn't reply because I'm really not so sure I want to give them anything now. Christmas is supposed to be the season of giving and I would be more than happy to gift my loved ones with a nice present and not expect anything in return. Like truly, and even for the kids. Yet in this case it was suggested to gift and receive by everyone that I'm no longer close to, so I did what a friend does, but I didn't expect everyone to conveniently forget about things. And this is why I hardly meet up with them now because they dont really care much about your feelings, they are always late for meet ups, and they always, always forget things like this! \n\nTL/DR: former close friends turned not so close friends suggested xmas gift exchange, only for all of them to forget or thought no gift exchange few days before the meet up. How exactly should I be feeling or reacting to this as all I feel is anger now which I think I shouldn't bother wasting my energy.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

M19 Bonus for being ok with awkwardness haha.", "author": "CashedOutTurtle", "self_text": "       (Scroll to skip to interests in 2nd paragraph)\n\nHey there umm I'm not sure how to exactly go about this. Honestly this may be a bad time for me to do this considering the state of mind I'm currently in. But waiting until morning probably means I'll procrastinate for way more. I actually made this account to meet people but with a few click or taps you can see how long I've been putting it off. One reason was that I kept seeing people complain about about folks that more wanted a therapist than a pal. And I didn't want to bother someone by accidentally doing that. The other more relevant reason was that I don't have any consoles or games on my computer. I know that's a real popular pastime on these sorts of subreddits but, I just didn't grow up like that. I'm definitely not wealthy by any means. And growing up in NY that sucks big time. Anyway to get specific about my situation, I get bored alot. My best friend is dealing with some heavy stuff so he's not available sometimes and we don't have much to do anyways. Don't want to be clingy as well, yes that old Chestnut. My other friends are busy at school. I know Christmas is around the corner but beyond that they're gonna be gone. Also...um yea i myself am not in school, or working atm. I know it's stereotypical but maybe you're in a similar boat. \n\n\nAnyways to actually know about my interests\nThey are movies. I really couldn't give you like an amateur film class but I'd love to learn. I really like some (again in stereotypical fashion) like Quentin Tarantino movies, as well as cinnemassacres recommendation videos. I love watching video essays about themes and technique used in film. Wisecrack has some really good stuff too.  Joker is definitely a conversation starter. I enjoyed it portrayal of austerity as well. More on that later. My favorite TV show is Better Call Saul. My god even from the opening shot I could tell it was gonna be great in technique as well as story. Even better than breaking bad and I'll fight ya on that one \n\nNow music. Let's see well for the longest metal was my favorite genre. It's really diverse so I didn't get bored for a long time. In fact for the past three years Rammstein have been my favorite artist on Spotify. But lately I've preferred prog rock or classic rock bands that were pushed aside for me by led Zeppelin when I was starting out. Love me some King crimson and rush. Also a while ago I discovered a band called Sleater-Kinney. So that's opened up New horizons for me in the alternative or pop scene. \n\nAlso stand up comedy. Ah Carlin and Hicks, how many hours of entertainment you've given me. I'm glad that Netflix is bringing the art form back into mainstream consciousness. One of my friends didn't even know comedy albums are called that because they used to be actual albums. But Marc maron is currently my favorite at the moment. Along with Louie Ck (even if hebdid s terrible thing) he sort of inspired me to pick up the pen. And more often than not make myself cringe than anyone else laugh but ah well. Their shoes are also great, both dealing with comedian stereotypes and sOciETy. \n\nOther forms of entertainment include failing at a pokemon emerald nuzlock challenge, game grumps, journaling, lamenting how underappreciated Hufflepuff is and hoping I don't see any more goddan JoJo spoilers. Also James May, good chap he is.\n\nAlso I mentioned austerity before and while I'm definitely up for a chat about politics I dont want it to be a deal breaker with any potential pals. So for now I'll just say that I'm pretty left wing, and enjoy an economic update here and there. \n\nSo if any if this seems cool just pm me and we'll add each other on discord. Oh also I'm Hispanic and am indeed 420 and ADHD friendly if you wanted to know. I've gone on far enough so I look forward to an awkward meeting. Have a good one.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

A couple of years ago my wife [25] and I [27] moved to a small town. It\u2019s one of those places where everyone has known each other since high school. For months we couldn\u2019t make any friends. We just played board games with each other.\n\nOne day I went out on a limb and maybe a post about finding a D&amp;D group in town. A couple reach out to us and we immediately clicked. We started hanging out all the time. We hung out a couple times a week, and it was a great friendship match. \n\n9 months ago, we had our first baby. When we did they kind of just dropped off. They said they wanted to give us the space we needed. We have no family in town and tried to explain how badly we needed friends in our lives, but that didn\u2019t help.\n\nThey just became less involved in our lives. Not responding to texts, and basically just wanting to do the occasional dinner out. He and I had started a weekly board game night with a couple of guys he knows, when I went through a really rough patch with the baby.\n\nNow to keep that game night going and he largely just blows off my texts and messages, so in turn the other guys do (as they know him better). I messaged him last night and asked if he was getting my messages-he said he was and that he might make it to the next night if the weather wasn\u2019t bad. I tried asking if I was being a bother or if he didn\u2019t want to hang out any more, he gave one word short answers saying everything was fine basically. Then started ignoring me again when I tried to say I wanted to hang out more again.\n\nFaced with the prospect of going back to no friends, I\u2019m super bummed. I\u2019m hurt and feel like I did something wrong. It\u2019s in my nature to try to fix stuff, and I don\u2019t know what to do. The wife and I have been trying to make new friends, but not having any luck. I just kind of feel like a loser. \n\nI feel ridiculous continuing to text and ask if he/they want to hang out. I\u2019m thinking if he blows me off again saying something like \u201che I don\u2019t know what happened, but let me know when you want to be friends again. Otherwise I\u2019ll stop bothering you.\u201d \n\nTLDR: only friends ignoring texts, slowly becoming less involved since I had a baby, not sure what to do, feel like a loser.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Of course I'm not here to request a personal assistant, I am looking for a friend before anything, but I would really appreciate someone who could motivate me to do things since that's the biggest issue in my life right now. I would happily help you in what way I can, too, naturally.\n\nSo, for quite some time now, I've been having issues with productivity, by which I don't mean that I'm just not doing well as I want to\u2014No, the thing is I'm doing almost nothing at all. Not only am I neglecting what I want to do, but also what I quite literally have to do. It's been really getting to me and I'm obviously not great at dealing with it on my own, hence my post here.\n\nBut enough with the bitching, I'll talk a bit about myself. Well, I guess the first thing I can say is I'm not a person who has an easy time talking about himself. I've got I could say, yet none of it seems completely valid or particularly important. Socially, I guess I'm a pretty easy-going guy. Although I'm not very charismatic, I usually get along well with everyone. I usually become the clown of any given group in time, but I've been the quite kid as well. That, however, is only who I am among people, which I'd say doesn't say too much about me\u2014but then, I can't say too much about myself either. I'm inconsistent, I guess. Not because I contradict myself often, but because I'm always swinging back and forth between rationality/emotionality, arts/sciences, pessimism/neutrality etc.  I could talk about my interests: I'm really interested in philosophy and lately some literature, too. I like playing computer games, my main means of procrastination. I wish I could say I like reading books, researching, composing music and writing, but those are ambitions rather than hobbies when I'm spending most of my time on computer. I'm more or less interested in many things though, so I doubt we'd run out of topics to talk about. Oh, and lastly, I'm in my last year in high school, so that's mostly what I'm dealing with. Normally I don't care about school too much, but this year is really crucial, so naturally it's been causing me a bit of stress. Still, I usually feel apathetic rather than stressed, which is worrying on another level.\n\nThank you if you've read all of that. I'm primarily hoping for someone to help me in my struggles as I've said, but still, don't hesitate to reach out if you found my post interesting.

During this time my friend John was flirting with her as usual, but every so often she would comment saying something like \"I like your voice\" or \"You are emotionally strong, thats attractive\" to me. This made John clearly upset and he ended up leaving after the two of them (being drunk) fought over the keys. John left (after he sobered up) and texted her a weird apology which she proceeded to show me. She laughed about it and called it weird and even asked if I could text him and act like I was her (which I of course declined).\n\nSince this incident John has been very upset with me and I have not even talked to either of them, besides texting. She has complimented me and called me cute in front of John before, but I think this time it really got to him. To add she never talks like this when it is just me and her, only around John. It bothers me cause he keeps on trying to start arguments with me over the group chat and does not want me to be included when all of our friends hang out, but continues to kiss her ass in everything she does.\n\nAm I over thinking this and it really is John being silly, or is Mary manipulating him.

As the title says I'm looking for buds to play games with, swap music, and general art things. A bit about me: I'm Canadian. That means I have a dumb accent, I say sorry as sore-e not sar-e, our money is cooler than yours, bagged milk is the bomb, and believe it or not I don't like hockey. That's it. That's my entire personality summed up for you. Oh, and I'm overwhelmingly sarcastic and I like to talk shit. Those are kind of important.  \n\nAbout 2 1/2 years ago I got back into drawing after a 7 year hiatus so I'm crazy behind where I should be skill wise. Hoping to one day make a career out of it but that's a long way off. If you're into sharing your art, lookin' to give and receive input, help each other grow, do art swaps, definitely message me. I have zero art friends and they seem like the hardest to keep around for some reason. Maybe it's just too independent of an activity to base a friendship on? I don't know.  \n\nAs far as games go I play on PC and I'm lookin' for a co-op buddy or two. I've had my fill of PvP games. I just recently finished Far Cry 5 and am hoping to either do a NG+ on the hardest difficulty or start New Dawn. I also picked up Red Dead Redemption 2 but I haven't played it at all so please teach me to cowboy. Other than those I mainly play RPGs, survival, and indie games. I love zombies and post-apocalyptic games. If you want a list [CLICK HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamerPals/comments/eb4z63/26mestpc_lookin_for_a_coop_buddy_for_a_variety_of/) to go to a post I made the other day that's all gaming focused.  \n\nMusic. What can I say other than I'm an indie pop trash boy? In fact, [Spotify even told me so which means it's gotta be true](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/395599944024588289/652325215434571780/Untitled.png). I absolutely love those end year reviews. My all time favourite artists are Chvrches, Wye Oak, Veela, Fall Out Boy, and Hannah Telle, then you got a bunch of other stuff sprinkled in there like Billie Eilish, Three Days Grace, Linkin Park, The Sounds, Alexandra Savior, Alvvays, Panic! at the Disco, Of Monsters and Men, Interpol, Purity Ring, Shakira, Silversun Pickups, Death Cab for Cutie, and a little bit of Eminem to top it off. It's an absolute mess. I love swapping music and I especially love taking walks down memory lane and listening to those late 90's early 00 songs that fill me with nostalgia.  \n\nAnyway, if you've actually made it this far then good on ya. All I need from you is that you be 18+, use Discord (mic mandatory for gaming and PTT preferred), and not take stuff too seriously. Shoot me a message and tell me about yourself, maybe hit me with your favourite song and game. You don't need to write a novel like me but low effort replies equals low effort people who you barely talk to and delete in a week.. so.. ya. Don't be a sheet of cardboard and it'll be alright. See ya!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

No need to type in weird commands that you forget the prefix for even though you've just done the command a few seconds ago and it's all pinned in the bots channel. :D\n\nThere is a one word story channel that has some weird lines that have been followed ;\n\n\"Grandma cried because she had a stroke.\"\n\n\"Grandma lost all her marbles because she ate them.\"\n\n\"Death is for Australians who commit fraud.\"\n\n\"I'm going to my room because I'm bored.\"\n\nThe server is rife with honks and other nonsense that I believe has been conceived in an elaborate plot just to annoy me and drive me crazy.

I need help\u2014 I\u2019ve never done this before.\n\nI\u2019m posting here instead of something like \u201crelationshipAdvice\u201d, because this would get buried for sure there. This is still relevant to this subreddit.\n\n\nTL;DR\u2014 I like someone I volunteer with who doesn\u2019t want to date anyone from the same volunteer place because of a poor experience she had with someone who volunteered there as well. We used to hang out on occasion, and were quite fine for a while even after she told me about her experience, but she\u2019s become distant the past few months. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s distancing herself and I\u2019m not sure how to ask her what she\u2019s feeling and why. (I\u2019m going it\u2019s something that can be worked out to where we can even just be friends.)\n\n\nFull-text:\nThere\u2019s this girl I volunteer with who I really like. (We\u2019re both young adults, with me being slightly older (and yeah, I\u2019m a dude)). We hit a major pothole in our relationship.\nWe\u2019ve hung out a few times in groups along with going on a few dates ever since this past Spring. (She was actually the first to ask the other on a date.) One time I asked her out on a date about a week after we did a group activity with friends. She declined, saying that she wasn\u2019t looking to get romantically involved with anyone who volunteered at the same place she did. She said that she\u2019d had a bad experience doing it once, and that she didn\u2019t want to do it again because it made it hard for her to go back and volunteer (which she absolutely loves doing\u2014 it\u2019s a huge part of her life). She said that she\u2019d still like to do activities as friends, though, and the interest she expressed seemed genuine. She was really nice about it, but I was still heartbroken. Still, I understood and told her I was totally fine with that. (Then I said I wasn\u2019t trying to get romantically involved with her (yeah, I know\u2014 immensely stupid.)\n\nFast forward a few months to now and we\u2019ve hung out only once or twice. I try to respect her space, but it\u2019s still hard. I haven\u2019t asked her out on a date and have tried to treat her as a friend, but within the past two months she\u2019s rejected me a few times to go out and do different things with a group of friends (and I\u2019m pretty sure it wasn\u2019t the activities \ud83d\ude02). She\u2019s used the same excuse, giving no explanation AT ALL why she can\u2019t come either time. (Last time I asked for one she told me about the relationship thing.)\n\nShe\u2019s told me that she\u2019s had fun whenever we\u2019ve hung out, and it truly seemed that she was having fun (she wasn\u2019t indifferent, genuinely enjoyed things (the activities, my company), etc. (NOTE: though I\u2019m not perfect, I\u2019ve tested for fairly above average in emotional intelligence. I\u2019m not completely oblivious) so you can see why I\u2019m pretty confused. We haven\u2019t really spoken at the place we both go to (1. we\u2019re normally busy helping others and 2. I\u2019ve felt too awkward and sad to initiate contact with her myself). I don\u2019t know if she doesn\u2019t want to hang out because she\u2019s worried about the relationship thing, if she feels awkward, or if it\u2019s because she just doesn\u2019t want to put effort into a friendship with me. (NOTE: If it\u2019s the latter then it\u2019s really out of nowhere, because she\u2019s always been friendly and kind even after all of this happened. Even now I think.) I want to ask her, but I\u2019m not sure how to. She\u2019s seems fairly conflict avoidant and I don\u2019t want to put her into a corner.\n\nI\u2019m willing to just be friends with her, because she\u2019s absolutely amazing (talented, smart, compassionate, kind, a bit of a nerd like me (don\u2019t tell her I said that \ud83d\ude02), beautiful, funny, low key emo (also like me), loves so many of the same things I do (most of which are rare interests), etc.). She\u2019s an absolute gem\u2014 and diamond\u2014 and I just want to preserve the relationship we have/had, but don\u2019t know how to. Thanks. :)", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I did always know that he somehow was jealous of me. Lately this 2 years has got me really thinking about our friendship is really even that worth! \nLet\u2019s call him X..\n\nThis is maybe gonna be complicated - and may sound childish - idk  \nIt\u2019s a little life story and only few points of our long friendship \n\nso I can\u2019t really start from the start but here are some things that have gotten me feeling like this!\n\n\nWe are both in high school, but in different schools.\nI had a best friend Q in my high school ( Q and I had known each other for more than a decade), X was jealous.\nI had a girl friend that was me very close in high school, he was jealous. Because he never had a girl friend( not a girlfriend) that was that close to him in his own high school. He told me that they were fake in his high school! I eventually kicked with another dude later on in high school, X was jealous - 1st time he even told me that!\n\nKnow I don\u2019t even talk to them folks anymore, because I changed high school. And X is happy about that!\n\nI have uncles that have rare vintage clothes, yes stylish vintage clothes. Every time I get a piece from my uncles he says \u201c oh probably sponsored from uncles, huh?\u201d  \nI have even borrowed him some pieces, because his uncles never gave him stuff. \nOne time he borrowed a yellow hoodie from me, he told me when he was wearing it in school - he got compliments every where. He gave it back and said \u201c I\u2019m looking for a real yellow hoodie, not fake yellow color\u201d dfuk (ungrateful) \nHe borrowed a jacket from me (he still has it to this day today) he uses it for workout -with his sweaty ass!\nHe actually got me to show all of my clothes, so he could see my clothe game!\nAnd eventually upgrade his own.\n\n(May sound childish)\n\nHe says I\u2019m a great storyteller, he also said that I have a more interesting life than he does. So I have told him almost everything through the years. About girls, trips, gossip and other stories like that. I eventually realized that he never told me something, something useful.. like he had shit to tell but only told me things from the tip of the iceberg! \n\nSomehow all he wants is to have what I have, or if I do something with somebody, he gonna do the same with others just to show me that he also have options.  If I post something on Instagram, he gets annoyed if he can\u2019t post something better in stories or homepage. He thinks we\u2019re playing chest .He even told me that it hurted him when Im posting stories about me, hanging out with other friends , eating food, being in bars, seeing a movie etc. When I think about our friendship, it has  always been a competition for him! \n\nThis episode got me really really thinking about our friendship. We tried weed (kids don\u2019t do drugs) \nYes I had tried it before him, like every other things in life.  I got a bad trip (search for it) like a feeling of not living in the real world and having a feeling of death every second. It\u2019s like being on the edge between life and death. I was constantly crying (and I\u2019m not a guy who cries out of the blue) He laughed and joked about me through the whole scenario. Thanks to God we was 4 people that day, so the others took care of me. He wasn\u2019t high that day. He smiled through the thing, he looked like the devil who finally won a battle!\n\nAfter that I got disgusted by him and we didn\u2019t talk for over a month. I even told one of my good friends about this, and he said that we must see it from his perspective. He didn\u2019t give me right, even tho X was\u2019nt there when I needed him the most (through my bad trip/ death experience)\n\n(Like I said before, I have tried almost everything first between us.. he\u2019s eyes always lightens up when I tell him stuff and stories he haven\u2019t Tried yet) lightning of jealousy. \n\n\nWe finally got in touch through our mutual friend. \nHis sorry was\u201d I was also high, so I didn\u2019t know if you made that up\u201d \n\nKnow we don\u2019t talk like we used to. Every time we\u2019re together he just wanna know what\u2019s status with my life and if I have anything interesting to story tell.  Constantly trying to figure out what I have been doing lately, who I have texted, who I have seen, who I have talked to, what my plan is, if I\u2019m seeing somebody new etc - curiosity in a dark way. Ambivalence feeling. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t tell him. We\u2019re both cold. There are coldness between us. He won\u2019t  say anything because i don\u2019t say things like I used to do before.\n\n\nWhen there is periods/time were we haven\u2019t seen each other, I compliment him. He don\u2019t compliment me at all, he\u2019s still ungrateful and trying to win. I compliment him to see if he has moved or changed behavior. He has not. \n\nI really don\u2019t know why he is like that or acting like that. Personal I don\u2019t get jealous Of people, because it\u2019s not in my nature - instead of getting jealous, I admire and learn. He\u2019s the opposite. \n\nHe once told me that he used to see some \u201creversed dark psychology\u201d and how to win every \u201cfight\u201d in life. And control others in situations.\nHe always wants to win a discussion or just have a little bit right. \nWhen he tells me something, it\u2019s very strange things. \n\nHonestly I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m writing this and guys you may think I\u2019m crazy or delusional. It\u2019s fine, but I really had to take this out of my chest. \nI really need some advices, have you tried something like this or some experience?\nThank you for reading!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Then on a trip with him earlier this year, he asked if I was happy and told me I need to reconsider the marriage.\n\nI haven't talked him since and I'm feeling guilt. But if I reach out to him, I have a feeling we will be friends but he still won't support my decision and I can't really take that right now.

Sorry about that and thanks for reading it. \n\nAfter years of a rocky friendship, my best friend (let\u2019s call them Heidi idk) and I developed a close bond for each other. Heidi has been there for me for the past 2 years. She\u2019s been there when I was hospitalized (like everyday she was with me) more then my own parents would be (they visited once for 20 mins). She\u2019s been there when I was going through an abusive relationship, telling me that my ex is terrible person and I should just move forward with my life. Which at the time I didn\u2019t get mad because I agreed, my ex is a piece of shit. Then I celebrated Christmas with her and her family last year instead of my own. Heidi and her family took me in without hesitation. I\u2019ll be honest and say I don\u2019t have the best relationship with my parents specifically my mom. So being in a different family who cares about me makes me happy. \n\nSo this year Heidi decided to let me live with her. I figured it\u2019s best since my apartment lease ran out and I couldn\u2019t afford it anymore, plus I wouldn\u2019t have to move back with my parents. So after my college ended, I lived with Heidi since late August of this year. Around this time, she was also going through relationship problems and her ex broke up with her. I realized that hey maybe I can help her like she helped me.. boy I was wrong. If I tried to help her, she\u2019ll get mad and say that\u2019s not what she wants to hear and wants empathy. So I was like okay, less advice giving more caring. Ngl, I had to chose my words around her because if I tell her that she\u2019s an amazing individual, she deserves the best of life and she learn to be kind to herself, she hates hearing that. And if I accidentally mix a sentence of those sentences by saying, idk, he\u2019s not worth it or fuck him or you need to start living for you, she\u2019ll interpret it as \u201coh op is saying that I should move on, what a cruel friend I have\u201d. So I gave up. Especially since we had a therapist session me and her. Long story short, I told her to come to work because there\u2019s a meeting, she said she couldn\u2019t cause she\u2019s depressed especially since of the breakup, I responded with okay whatever. And she was furious. I get it, I saw what I did wrong, I apologized. So in that therapy session we were talking it out and I brought up how I feel like she\u2019s a hypocrite and she laughed at me when I said that. I never forget it. Plus, she accused me of faking my hours of work, won\u2019t forget that either (cause I don\u2019t). \n\nSo I\u2019d say this happened somewhere in September. Fast forward a month and I realized a trend. I work 5-9pm and when I came home, I see her doing 3 things. 1) she\u2019ll be sleeping nothing wrong with it 2) we\u2019ll hang out and I\u2019ll try to make the effort to talk to her but she\u2019ll be on her phone till 3) she gets up and calls her ex for the rest of the night. I realized after 3 weeks of living with her she calls her ex everyday and talks to him all night. She claims that she can\u2019t get over him, will never find love so she\u2019ll wait for him to get therapy. Which meant she\u2019ll wait for him to get his bachelor (he needs a fifth year in college) then his masters, then after a year of working, she\u2019ll wait for him to get therapy so they can work it out. So basically she\u2019ll wait 5-6 years for him. She knows how I feel which I don\u2019t approve but hey not my life. Anyways, she calls him everyday and claims that their best friends now. Which is great cause it\u2019s not everyday you can be friends with your ex but she still wants to get over him. \n\nFast forward this to when we wanted to go to an event. We planed a whole year to go to this event on a Saturday. Day comes and she didn\u2019t wanted to go because she was feeling very depressed, I get that, I\u2019ve been there before. Though I asked if she was still going with her ex the next day cause the event is a two day thing. She said yes but she\u2019s unsure if he\u2019s going. I told her, If she cancels out on me today and goes with her ex the next day, I\u2019ll be upset. She then looks and me and said let\u2019s go. So we went. Mind you she was depressed but the next day when she was with her ex, she\u2019s didn\u2019t hesitate to go. In matter of fact she looked very happy. \n\n\nFast forward, we have this talk where she wanted me to tell her how much I need her in my life and I did. I told her that she\u2019s my best friend, I consider her as a soul sister and I\u2019d take a bullet for her. I noticed that since then she never told me how she feels about our friendship. Like if she loves me or not so I\u2019m like okay, I mean she tells her best friend who\u2019s her ex that she can\u2019t live without him but ok. \n\n\nFast forward and after realizing what I come home to (the 3 things), I decided to hang out with another close friend of mine since he lived down the street from my work place. So everyday after work I come over to his place, we talk, watch anime and overall have fun. Like he tells me that he feels that I lacked attention at home so he feels that I always came to visit him cause he gives me attention. It could be simple as talking to me about anything and that makes my day. So now I hang out with my close friend and even on the weekends, I thought it was fine since me and her would be doing our own thing. During this time, I began picking up my pace as a roommate. I\u2019ll admit I don\u2019t do chores around the house unless if I get told so. But moving forward I\u2019ll take more initiative in finding out what needs to be clean. So instead I keep my room clean. I realized I\u2019m not home a lot so I keep my room clean. \n\n\nFast forward, me and Heidi hanged out and she asked me \u201cwhy do you hang out with your close friend a lot?\u201d I told her that\u2019s the same way if I asked \u201cwhy do you call your ex everyday?\u201d She tells me that she feels that I don\u2019t want to talk to her nor hang out with her. I told her that\u2019s not true. Fast forward it to last week, she stumbled across her ex\u2019s playlist of music on Spotify. She told me since she didn\u2019t have premium that Spotify auto generated a bunch of love songs and one song ending the playlist called \u201cmarry me\u201d. She looked in despair when telling me this, her face looked like she witness a disaster. So I told her Spotify is dumb as fuck and I\u2019m concerned for her. She asked why, I told her I was concerned that for a split second she thought that she had a chance with her best friend/ex which I told her is painful to feel. I told her I was worried she felt that pain. Then she looked even more sadder. I told her, I\u2019m surprised that you\u2019re more sad then you should be. I told her I was going to the bathroom and she walked out of the room in silence. \n\n\nI have this built up of emotions so I decided to talk to her on Tuesday night (before her therapy the next day). I told her that I feel like she values her friendship with her ex more then she values her friendship with me. I told her that I can no longer hear any pain you get from your ex because it\u2019s too much for me. It\u2019s not triggering, it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t handle it but I have too much opinions and I think it\u2019s best if I don\u2019t share it. Ngl I told her I feel like I\u2019m watching a forest fire and I can\u2019t look away. I\u2019ll admit, calling your friend a forest fire is not the way to go. That\u2019s my mistake, I\u2019m owning to it because I know that\u2019s wrong. So she kept quiet, thank me and I went to bed. \n\n\nFast forward to idk Friday or Thursday, she calls me closer friend (the one who I hang out a lot) and according to him had a lot to say about me. She kept calling me just a friend but her ex is her best friend. She said that I never cleaned and I\u2019m taking advantage of her. She said that she expected me to apologize not to say all of this. She said that she tries to talk to me or hang with me but I\u2019m always on my phone. Trust there\u2019s more but my friend had to be vague as possible because he didn\u2019t want to hurt me. I cried on Saturday because I told him that I told Heidi that I feel like I have to walk around eggshells around her and he says she\u2019s starting to say the same thing about me so I\u2019m just like okay. I told him that yeah I don\u2019t clean the house, but in our room (me and Heidi) I actually clean up after her. Like I said I may not do much outside my room and that\u2019s my fault but I do make sure the room is clean and she would leave empty food containers from fast food places in my room. Ngl, since I live with her and her family, her mom agrees with me that she doesn\u2019t clean. She refuses to clean and Heidi would spend 7 days of the week sleeping all day. Furthermore, she told me Tuesday night that she doesn\u2019t remember what I said during Friday night about the Spotify playlist (because she blocked it out of her memory) but proceeds to tell my closet friend (2 days after our talk on Tuesday night) that she does remember and she remembers that I laughed at her. I never laughed at her. \n\n\nLast Sunday night we finally talked again. She apologized for getting on the phone with her ex when we\u2019re watching something. I took the apology. She told me that she expected me to apologize what I said to her about the Spotify playlist and I didn\u2019t tbh. Instead I told her that if she has a problem with what I said to call me out on the spot like we been through this back when we had a session in September. One thing I\u2019ll add, she tells me that I ignore her when she\u2019s trying to talk with me and I told her that\u2019s how I feel too. I mentioned that she\u2019s on her phone when I\u2019m trying to talk to her and she laughs. We talked and this is where the title of this post comes in. \nIn my talk on Tuesday night, I mentioned to her that I feel like this friendship is one sided. So she brought that up to me again but in her manner. She said \u201chow dare you call me a bad friend, after everything I did for you. I gave you my personal space, my home, a job (she did help me get the job I currently have) and thousands of money (for me to get therapy). How dare you say that I don\u2019t treat you right.\u201d That did not sit well with me. I looked at her and I realized that \u201cwow am I a leech?\u201d So we finished our talk (theres more to say but this post seems very lengthy so I\u2019m cutting it as much as I can) and I went to sleep. \n\n\nYesterday I went to see my therapist and I decided this: I wanted to move out and get a new job because it seems like it\u2019s putting a strain in our friendship. I told my therapist, I rather live with my parents to preserve what I have with Heidi. My therapist was trying to insinuate that it\u2019s a terrible idea. So I was like okay, maybe I\u2019m bringing my personal life to work. I shouldn\u2019t do that because work is work. But living with her, idk. So I told my therapist that she tried to justify why she isn\u2019t a bad friend after everything she gave me and I told her I felt guilt tripped, like nothing I said matter and terrible part of it, I felt manipulated. My therapist told me to let that go because Heidi isn\u2019t my abusive mother and even tho she may show some traits that my history isn\u2019t relevant to today. \n\n\nI cried in my car after my session. I didn\u2019t knew what to do believe. All this happened is because I simply expressed how I\u2019ve been feeling, I vowed to myself to never want to express to Heidi again. I called my closet friend last night and he believes Heidi is in the wrong. He tells me this vital important information that made me change my perspective on Heidi. On the talk on Tuesday night, I told Heidi that I can see myself being next to her forever. Because we have this bond as a friends that no matter what I\u2019ll stick by her. My closet friend told me that she took it as that I\u2019m in love with her and I\u2019m jealous of her ex. That.. broke me. Million questions ran through my head and the biggest one is why didn\u2019t she tell me this? Like I\u2019m not in love with her I\u2019m sorry but she\u2019s not my type. So I\u2019m like weirded out now. Idk what to do. My therapist told me to let me suspicion go that she\u2019s manipulating me when she tried to justify that she\u2019s not a bad friend. Ngl I told my closet friend, Heidi reminds me of Regina George where she\u2019s like \u201cwhy is Janet (i don\u2019t remember the goth chick girl) obsessed me? Just cause I blow her off to hang with my bf and not call her back. She gets mad and asks me why I didn\u2019t call back like why she\u2019s obsessed with me?\u201d My closet friend stayed extremely silent and was like \u201cyeah... she sounded like that\u201d. \n\n\nI know it\u2019s wrong to talk behind friends back, but Heidi isn\u2019t telling me the whole story. My closet friend is trying to tell me as vague as possible because he said that Heidi had a lot of cruel things to say about me. I have no idea what to do. At this point I plan to get a new therapist because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to have the same therapist as Heidi. I\u2019m very conflicted and I frankly want to cry in my bed.\n\n\nTL DR: I approached my roommate/best friend that she isn\u2019t treating me like a friend. I told her that we only hang out when she\u2019s not busy. I admit I\u2019m not always home because she doesn\u2019t pay attention so I figure to hang out with other friends. Her reasoning is that she doesn\u2019t believe that she\u2019s a terrible friend, that she gave me a home, a job and money for therapy so there\u2019s no excuse to feel this way.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to believe. I\u2019m lost.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I did always know that he somehow was jealous of me. Lately this 2 years has got me really thinking about our friendship is really even that worth! \nLet\u2019s call him X..\n\nThis is maybe gonna be complicated - and may sound childish - idk  \nIt\u2019s a little life story and only few points of our long friendship \n\nso I can\u2019t really start from the start but here are some things that have gotten me feeling like this!\n\n\nWe are both in high school, but in different schools.\nI had a best friend Q in my high school ( Q and I had known each other for more than a decade), X was jealous.\nI had a girl friend that was me very close in high school, he was jealous. Because he never had a girl friend( not a girlfriend) that was that close to him in his own high school. He told me that they were fake in his high school! I eventually kicked with another dude later on in high school, X was jealous - 1st time he even told me that!\n\nKnow I don\u2019t even talk to them folks anymore, because I changed high school. And X is happy about that!\n\nI have uncles that have rare vintage clothes, yes stylish vintage clothes. Every time I get a piece from my uncles he says \u201c oh probably sponsored from uncles, huh?\u201d  \nI have even borrowed him some pieces, because his uncles never gave him stuff. \nOne time he borrowed a yellow hoodie from me, he told me when he was wearing it in school - he got compliments every where. He gave it back and said \u201c I\u2019m looking for a real yellow hoodie, not fake yellow color\u201d dfuk (ungrateful) \nHe borrowed a jacket from me (he still has it to this day today) he uses it for workout -with his sweaty ass!\nHe actually got me to show all of my clothes, so he could see my clothe game!\nAnd eventually upgrade his own.\n\n(May sound childish)\n\nHe says I\u2019m a great storyteller, he also said that I have a more interesting life than he does. So I have told him almost everything through the years. About girls, trips, gossip and other stories like that. I eventually realized that he never told me something, something useful.. like he had shit to tell but only told me things from the tip of the iceberg! \n\nSomehow all he wants is to have what I have, or if I do something with somebody, he gonna do the same with others just to show me that he also have options.  If I post something on Instagram, he gets annoyed if he can\u2019t post something better in stories or homepage. He thinks we\u2019re playing chest .He even told me that it hurted him when Im posting stories about me, hanging out with other friends , eating food, being in bars, seeing a movie etc. When I think about our friendship, it has  always been a competition for him! \n\nThis episode got me really really thinking about our friendship. We tried weed (kids don\u2019t do drugs) \nYes I had tried it before him, like every other things in life.  I got a bad trip (search for it) like a feeling of not living in the real world and having a feeling of death every second. It\u2019s like being on the edge between life and death. I was constantly crying (and I\u2019m not a guy who cries out of the blue) He laughed and joked about me through the whole scenario. Thanks to God we was 4 people that day, so the others took care of me. He wasn\u2019t high that day. He smiled through the thing, he looked like the devil who finally won a battle!\n\nAfter that I got disgusted by him and we didn\u2019t talk for over a month. I even told one of my good friends about this, and he said that we must see it from his perspective. He didn\u2019t give me right, even tho X was\u2019nt there when I needed him the most (through my bad trip/ death experience)\n\n(Like I said before, I have tried almost everything first between us.. he\u2019s eyes always lightens up when I tell him stuff and stories he haven\u2019t Tried yet) lightning of jealousy. \n\n\nWe finally got in touch through our mutual friend. \nHis sorry was\u201d I was also high, so I didn\u2019t know if you made that up\u201d \n\nKnow we don\u2019t talk like we used to. Every time we\u2019re together he just wanna know what\u2019s status with my life and if I have anything interesting to story tell.  Constantly trying to figure out what I have been doing lately, who I have texted, who I have seen, who I have talked to, what my plan is, if I\u2019m seeing somebody new etc - curiosity in a dark way. Ambivalence feeling. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t tell him. We\u2019re both cold. There are coldness between us. He won\u2019t  say anything because i don\u2019t say things like I used to do before.\n\n\nWhen there is periods/time were we haven\u2019t seen each other, I compliment him. He don\u2019t compliment me at all, he\u2019s still ungrateful and trying to win. I compliment him to see if he has moved or changed behavior. He has not. \n\nI really don\u2019t know why he is like that or acting like that. Personal I don\u2019t get jealous Of people, because it\u2019s not in my nature - instead of getting jealous, I admire and learn. He\u2019s the opposite. \n\nHe once told me that he used to see some \u201creversed dark psychology\u201d and how to win every \u201cfight\u201d in life. And control others in situations.\nHe always wants to win a discussion or just have a little bit right. \nWhen he tells me something, it\u2019s very strange things. \n\nHonestly I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m writing this and guys you may think I\u2019m crazy or delusional. It\u2019s fine, but I really had to take this out of my chest. \nI really need some advices, have you tried something like this or some experience?\nThank you for reading!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I was deeply hurt by the event and am unsure how to respond, if at all.\n\nEarlier this year a long-time friendship kind of exploded. We both had our faults that led to it, and it would've been fine if we had talked about it civilly and decided to part ways, but we kind of didn't. It got very personal, and I left feeling very hurt and angry.\n\nFurthermore, as we were co-workers at the time, I have reason to believe that they played no small part in me getting fired from my job. It was a miracle that I got a new one in a timely fashion but it was still a month or so where I could barely afford to live.\n\nThey just messaged me today saying they've \"thought about\" what happened and would like to talk. I saw this coming, because in all the years I've known them they've done the same thing with the (countless) people they've fought with in the past.\n\nI'm definitely not allowing them back in my life; the things they said and did were far too hurtful to trust them again. I'm stuck on how to respond, or if to respond at all. Any tips?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "ec2o6u", "created_utc": 1576619625, "title": "Has anyone repaired a friendship after recovering from depression?", "author": "needtorecover2", "self_text": "This is my first post and I\u2019m typing it on my phone, so hopefully it\u2019s not confusing! I\u2019ve struggled with PTSD, depression, and anxiety since I was 10ish and am 26 now. In college, I made \u201cfriends\u201d and was so happy to finally not be alone. But realized they weren\u2019t true friends, and someone I considered close is now engaged to a man who sexually assaulted me multiple times and is supported by most of my friends.\n\nSince my abuse, I\u2019ve tried to hide feelings. I recently got my Masters in school counseling and had an amazing supervisor (F30) for 2 years. She opened up to me about her struggles, and we began to get close. I began to trust her and opened up. At the beginning, I downplayed it but then began to reveal my actual struggles. She would tell me how I wouldn\u2019t be alone and would always have her. On my last day of internship, she told me that she would rather have me texting her all day than lying in bed and not talking to anyone.\n\nAt the beginning, she was reaching out to me to check in. I began to feel supported and actually was able to open up to my therapist about the extent of my trauma because of this support. She even wrote me a note that said to remember that I can always reach out and will always have a caring friend in her. I trusted her and she became like a big sister to me. She was struggling too at this time as her boyfriend of 4 years broke up with her. But she kept talking to me. I began to text her more, typically multiple times a week. She never said anything about it. She began to seem off when school began but said she was busy.\n\nI began to really struggle around September due to my meds. During this time, I texted about suicidal thoughts. The first weekend in October, I reached out about this and asked if she would be willing to call my psychologist to let him know. She did, but then said that it was the limit of what she can do and she couldn\u2019t support me how I need. Then she said she wasn\u2019t leaving me but needed to take time to focus on her, and would reach out when she was ready.\n\nMy therapist was advising me on when to reach out and what to say to repair my friendship. I would wait a few weeks before texting about things like rebalancing our friendship. She never replied to any of these. Over Thanksgiving, I messed up and texted quite a bit. That Tuesday I texted that I had a gift for her (I made her a gift of 365 notes for her 30th birthday and she cried telling me no one had done anything like this before so wanted to do that again). Texted on Thanksgiving to wish her a happy Thanksgiving, as my therapist said to do. My next session was that Monday, and my therapist said to share how my suicidal thoughts are gone now that I changed meds. My friend lost a friend to suicide a few years ago and while she reassured me that she was ok talking about it, it may have gotten to be too much. So I reached out sharing that. I also reached out Monday evening saying it\u2019s been 2 months and asking if she could react to a message so I knew she was alive and ok (have anxiety about people dying after losing 3 family members in less than 3 months). She replied and said she had told me she would contact when she was ready to reach out and I have not respected that. She said she wishes me the best but to please not reach out to her again. I panicked and said I wouldn\u2019t and was trying to give her space, and I hoped she would give me a second chance. 2 days later, I texted explaining that I didn\u2019t realize I shouldn\u2019t text at all and wasn\u2019t trying to disrespect her but I understood now. Then realized she blocked me.\n\nI am so panicked. I was trying to repair the friendship but instead ruined it. My therapist said to now work on getting better to help repair the friendship eventually.

Anyway I had to move one of my shifts for a reason and the only one I could do was the night she worked and I was so excited I got to see her like every week and be with her for 6 hours, so we got even more closer, we would sit in my car for a couple of hours after work and just spoke about anything, then there was the week that changed a lot between us, I'll be honest I kind of started having feelings for her about a week before this happened and I think she knew but didn't say anything.\n\n We where both sat in my car after work and we started speaking about relationships, life, and our sex life's. She told me she had broken up with her boyfriend who she was with for a long time and she had kids with aswell, I kind of saw that as a chance but didn't want to say too much because I was a bit scared to tell her, I then mentioned to her that I've never done anything with a girl besides kissing one and she jokingly took the piss but I was fine with it I knew she was only joking around, we spoke a little more then for some reason I decided I would pretend to try kiss her to see how she would react(not sure why I thought of doing it to be honest) I got kind of close and stopped and she said to me don't kiss me or I'll slap you so I sat back into my seat, spoke a little longer then I dropped her off home. We spoke to whole week and our chat was getting more and more flirty and we sent pictures to eachother aswell so we where getting fairly comfortable around eachother. She wasn't working the her normal shift that week but she decided to come in when I was working when she got back from where she went out and asked if I could give her a lift back and I said yes.\n\nShift finishes we go back to my car and spoke for a bit as we normally do, I then asked her about the previous week about me getting close to her and her saying she would slap me if I kissed her, I asked her how come she said that and would she ever kiss me, she said she would and she said that because she wasn't really expecting it which is fair enough. Anyway I faced her and said do you want to try it now and without hesitation she leaned towards me and we start making out a few other things happened in the car which I won't go into details about but we didn't have sex, after it had all finished I took her home. Fast forward a few more weeks she meets this guy starts talking to him and I felt like I needed to tell her about my feelings for her so I did we spoke about it and come to conclusions that it probably wouldn't work out because or her situation and the fact I probably wasn't old enough for her situation with her having two kids and also having to move out of her house, it hurt but I knew where she was coming from.\n\nFew more weeks later she's still seeing this guy, at first she never told him about what happened between me and her but she ended up telling him everything a few days ago which is fine I'm not bothered about it and I don't think she is it all happened before she started seeing this guy, anyway she also mentioned it to someone we work with but he's somewhat close with her aswell so it was fine. But recently at work people we work with have started spreading rumours about us both how everytime I take her home after work we're fucking at her house and all that stuff because it's a guy and a girl getting along really well and it's got to the point now where everyone who we work with has something to say about us whether it's us talking to eachother a lot or hanging out with eachother a lot and it's really starting to piss us both off because they don't know what's happened between us two their all just making stuff up and it's almost like we're both the talking point of our work at the moment.\n\nNow this is the part why I'm on here, I finished work earlier and in the first hour I got four comments about me and her, I messaged her about it saying how childish they all are and the need to stay out of our business, it's really getting on her nerves now and she told me earlier that's she considering quitting Because of it (this isn't her only job it's just part time to earn more money) and that hit me really hard I literally just started balling my eyes out, she's my bestfriend, she's the only reason I like working there and I'm always so happy when I'm around her, but I can't blame her for wanting to quit she doesn't deserve all the shit. I'm worrying now that I'll barely get to see her now because of her wanting to quit, I only get to see her once a week through work and if she stops working there I don't know when I'll get to see her, she has her kids to look after, her full time job and obviously has a boyfriend as well. I don't know if I'm just being selfish but I don't want this to affect our friendship Because she is such a special person to me even if it's only as my friend, I'm just really worried and could probably do with some advice or something because I don't want to go back to how I was feeling before I started talking to her and not have her in my life because of pricks at my work spreading rumours about us.\n\n\nI'm sorry this is really long but I felt like there needed to be a bit of context I would really appreciate it if someone spoke to me about this.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

In middle school and high school we all had different phases and one of my friends went through a phase of as he himself described it \u201cbeing an ass 24/7 for no reason\u201d. This usually consist of him just talking garbage A LOT but has evolved in a way.\n\n      He is a good guy and is not an ass in his heart and does truly care about his friends a lot but sometimes he is just too much because he knows how to make each of us angry and he does it on purpose because he thinks it\u2019s funny. \n\n    The most recent and by far most irritating thing he has ever done is every....... single...... times someone talks about something they are interesting in/excited about/ thought was funny he cuts you off instantly and says in a annoying voice \u201cthat\u2019s craaaaaaaaaaazzzzzyyyy\u201d and will keep cutting you off and saying it until you stop talking. He has even started to do this while other people are having a conversation. Today for example, me and another very close friend were playing rainbow six siege and something funny had happened and we were talking about it and laughing and our other friend just kept talking over us so that we couldn\u2019t hear each other until we stopped trying to talk. \n\n     This isn\u2019t so bad until you add in the fact that if anyone cuts him off or does something similar to him he gets angry and childish and just try\u2019s to ruin whatever we are doing for everyone. \n\n     He is truly one of my best friends but I\u2019m not sure what to do at this point cause if I ignore him and let him just cut me off constantly then he wins and if I confront him he is just gonna brush it off and say I\u2019m angry or getting mad for stupid reasons. Getting fed up with this and it\u2019s been going on for a year now so I was hoping it was a phase but we are beyond that. \n\nSo do I confront him, ignore him, let him keep getting his way, or something else I haven\u2019t thought of?\n\n\nEdit: I should add I do want him to have a good life and part of this is me wanting him to be a better person because his behavior has made it so in our 8 person friend group he is the only one to not have had a girlfriend for over 1 month and only 6 total in the last 5 years while I myself and married and other friend have relationships lasting at least 2 years", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

So I\u2019m 22M and have been in a relationship with my S/O for about 2 years.. She is 22f and her little boy 5m..at first we lived in my mothers basement, and then we got our first apartment together and 9 months later we had had a baby boy (my first real blood child and he is currently 6months old) and after he was born we moved into a town house and have only been there 4 months. We were so happy together we had plans for our future as a family together. While she was pregnant I had proposed to her and she said yes - that was one of the most happiest moments in my life. And everything was good - she was going to school and I was a stay at home dad after our child was born - now up untill 2 months ago she was happy with me and then things started to take a bad turn - her love for me was not as it used to be - she fell herself into more depression and was not happy and it got to the point were even I started to feel it mind you this has been a very bad year for me (my cat passed away my grandmother passed away and my grandfather passed away aswell) all through out this year. So I have been depressed and sad alot through the year and i never took care of it myself so I ended up getting a problem with anger and i never realised how it affected her untill it was too late (my anger caused alot of fights and my temper to use wrong words and be mean and say stupid things ) and it never helped and now its to the fact where she loves me less to the point of not wanting to be with me. And I realised that part of what happened between us was my fault so I wanted to make admends and I have now made apointments with counsuling and i have been more docile and tempered but even after that she tells me it is her and that she was to be alone and focus on herself and the kids and it hurts me to the point were after she told me that she no longer has the same feelings for me or that spark that its tearing me apart - my family the only thing I wanted to support more in this world then myself - my little family lifted me up and made me feel better about things but I still never focused on myself and when I found out the hard way that I need to - it feels like its to late - i\u2019m still holding onto hope that we may have a future together but as of now she dont want to be together as partners and it sucks so bad - As of now I am temporarily living in my mothers basements that she rents to tennats as rooms and 2 other rooms are occupied with out of country students. And she is at home with the kids. I\u2019m alone with my cat right now and I\u2019m hurting and I\u2019m alone and it sucks. Thats the jist of what is going on - its been 2 days since iv left home and been living in my moms basement and so close to christmas for the kids - most of my friends are in relationships or either have kids thenselves and we dont have that conection anymore to talk about stuff like this its just a few words here or there. I\u2019m in need of someone to talk to.. my mind is all over the place.. I\u2019m sorry for this to be so long of a read but st this point I\u2019m alone and I dont want to be.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I am really worried, cause I moved back to a new hs now(freshman) everyone knows each other, people are quite friendly I would say, but I am worried I won't make any friends this year, I moved back for 8th grade, for only the last few months,  made a friend, thought he was a very good friend, hung out a lot with him and others, but now I just dont talk to him anymore at lunch and I still sit next to him, clubs won't help, I have talked to people about this(have the best parents and great therapidt) , and I tell them I can deal with it, cause I can, when I am at home in my room alone and I am watching something, I am happy, but from time to time I have thoughts about this but during lunch everyday , my heart sinks, and I am thinking should I just sit alone, I dont have any  good friends at all really. I always felt different than others my age, like I have an old soul or something, I think maybe I should start sitting alone, and maybe someone will come along, I just want it to happen next year, hope so, and if I switch schools that will be pointless because the same thing will happen again), don't know what to say anymore, this is basically my life story,  maybe I expect too much from \"friends\", but I always saw a friend as being loyal, guess I had a different definition of the word, anyways need just a  good friend or something,(if you want to search up the term old soul like on urban dictionary, and you might get the picture) Thank you if someone read all of this, would be great to have a new friend, and excuse me for my poor writing, have a great week.\nOh my interests in case: Elder scrolls, all type of fantasy wizard stuff, csgo, or mc doesn't matter, like to listen to the skyrim soundtrack a lot, philisophical conversations, but honestly I like most things\n history, and if anyone knows how to play dnd I wanna learn how to play", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Or, if I'm being realistic,  that one person who accidentally clicked on this. Age or gender don't matter. Unless it's you Ryan. You suck. Not Ryan S, but Ryan L...\n\n(EDIT: I realize just how stupidly depressing I am. I swear it's just how I write. And feel)\n\nThe holidays draw near and I'm getting kinda sad about it. I don't particularly like holidays or whatever. Seems that happiness makes me unhappy. Probably should look into that. But other than that, I'm right as rain!\n\nCan't say that I'm terribly interesting but as everyone on this sub has done before of themselves, allow me try to sell myself to you.\n\nI like to draw. It's one of the main things I do these days. I'm working on two comics at the moment. One more so than the other one. The first comic is about a kid who is the son of the grim reaper, trying to stop the end of the world from demons and zombies. It's....very gory. But a lot of heart! Although that's because he punched it out of her chest.\n\nI'm not great at drawing but I can't get these stories out of my head so I need to make them. I'm close to finishing the first chapter of the grim reaper one. I'm kinda excited to finish. Nervous that it was a waste of 10 months. Guess I'll find out soon enough :D\n\n\nOther than that, I listen to a  lot of music from all genres. Mostly from soundtracks to movies, games, anime which allows me to enjoy all types of music: John Williams, Hans Zimmer, Tyler Bates, Christopher Drake, Owl City, Danny Elfman, 50s-00's, Lorne Balfe, your mom.  All the greats. Currently, I'm obsessed with the song Send Me On My Way by Rusted Root. Listened to it like 6-7 times these past days.\n\nI've also tried to make my own songs. I made a few themes for an interactive novel I created a few years ago.\n\nI enjoy games as well: Assassins' Creed. Watch Dogs. Batman Arkham series. Recently got Playstation Now. Although I got it specifically so that I could stream and record the sound effects from games because I'm a (fan fare) A WEIRD NERD!\n\nSpeaking of streaming, I stream myself drawing so that I could talk to people. If you want we can talk. If you want. If...youre into that.\n\nWhich brings me to this. I like voice chats. Or, at least, the idea of it. I haven't spoken to people like that in some time. But I like it because sometimes I find it hard to understand people and it's easier to know what we are saying when we can hear the emotion in our voice.\n\nI really only have a few rules when it comes to talking to people. As long as you put the effort into the conversation, we should be fine. I like longer email-like messages, but it isn't a requirement (as you can see, I tend to write alot). And if you take more than 2 weeks to respond, then I'll be asking you if we should call it quits. No hard feelings or anything. If you're too busy, I totally understand.\n\n\nOkay, guess thats it. Uhhhhh... I don't like watermelon. I'm ordering Chinese food tomorrow and happy about it. I can't watch animals get hurt in films. Huge fan of Batman. I don't like ice in my pop. I still like the first novel/film of Twilight. I once watched a kid get run over by a truck and honestly I keep forgetting to look up on the internet to see if he died or not. My left eye is worse than my right, and I'm sure its because of all the porn (thats what my grand-pappy tells me). \n\n-Greg, the only man whose sense and two cents is only one cent, since his sense sucks.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

So my beat friend texted me to ask if I was alright and I responded of course cause I always fall for peer pressure to respond to people. I've helped this friend numerous times mind you and God the worst of em too. But I was getting super low and they asked me to open up and well I did cause I felt like I didnt have a choice so I talked about my dark thoughts what I've been feeling and they got mad even though they wanted me to open up? In the past aswell they had been very obsessive almost acting like we were dating (we are both the same gender and I am straight but she kept also trying to push the fact I was something else? Even though they know I'm not????) So about a week later of not responding to them because I was honestly hurt deeply by them doing that to me I was always kind of weighed down by them (as I am with everyone I cross I be sure of that) I finally responded and said it would be best to go separate ways and that I needed to recover and they like wouldnt stop clinging onto me? Even though they saw I was done? So now I am much happier without them but did I make the right choice? Or have I made a mistake? Cause they were nice and all but I'm not sure from the obbsessiveness to the anger to how they acted. Like did I REALLY make the right choice on letting them go? Or am I just an asshole for doing that to them?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I was bored one night, procrastinating sleep, when I stumbled upon a new idea. Inspired by the algorithmic matching of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/e185ze/quiz_to_help_you_find_friends_similar_to_yourself/?st=k4awa5nd&amp;sh=366b52b3) and the cute, human-based matching of [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/pibat/your_personal_cupid/?st=k4aw5zfv&amp;sh=e408d3d5) (old, I know), I decided to try my own version. I am going to try to match every responder with their new internet \"best friend.\" Basically, it works like this:\n\n1. Read the entire post and instructions. Otherwise, you will not understand the process correctly and I may have to cut you from the pool.\n2. Be prepared to wait for a little bit. There's no telling how many responses I may get (just see how many were in the automatic process). I will be doing this manually.\n3. Fill out the form [here](https://forms.gle/L8v4DGccjFwM1pEV8). Be comfortable with sharing this information with your \"match\" because this will be what I share with them. Be as thorough and specific as possible -- this will help me with matches, and help you to avoid small talk and get straight to the fun part. I cannot guarantee low effort responses will be matched.\n4. Wait.\n5. Get matched! As soon as your match is finalized, I will send you a PM with the other person's reddit name and introduction. Contact them based on the provided information.\n6. See how it works out! If your match doesn't go well, PM me and I will add you back into the pool. Please be respectful and let the other person know you are doing this.\n\nThat's it! The only thing I ask in return for this service is a nice PM if it ends up working out. I want to know if my work leads to success stories!\n\nExtra Note: If you are interested in helping match other people, PM me and if there is an overwhelming response, I might request your help. And let me know if you're supportive of the idea in the comments :) Remember that the more people see this post, the higher the likelihood that someone perfect for you will match.\n\nDepending on the response, I might release matches in waves.\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone offering help and for all the positivity! Currently (\\~13 hours after posting) I have about 390 entries and growing. I will begin the process and try to get a feel for how to match people up before considering help, just to make it a little smoother. My current ETA for the majority of matches is early January, but that's just a guess at this point.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I'm a creative, introverted person. The most interaction I get is at work, otherwise, I'm staying home 100% of the time.\n\nSome interests of mine that I hope we can chat about;\n\n* **Psychology** \\- like why we do the things we do, what the heck love is about, how society normalizes the damaging effects of alcohol by how it's portrayed in the media, development stuff (everyone talks about Freud but I'm JUST beginning to study it), and interactions between people (mostly relationships, because I'm a hopeless romantic).\n* **Video Games** \\- That is such a blanketed term for what I would love to talk about in regards to video games. LIKE. I LOVE lore, with a passion. I like psychologically analyzing horror games, and making sense of the world and try to make sense in why the villain took such a turn. The main genres you'll see me play is horror, psychological thriller, RPG, and FPS.\n* **Writing** \\- I love writing stories, fictional characters are my speciality. I'm currently writing two fanfictions, and one original story. I'm a BIG roleplayer too, so that's also something to talk about and get into. Most genres I write SciFi, romance, psychological thriller, horror, and sometimes fantasy.\n* **Music** \\- My dudes, I'll listen to anything. I don't have a really particular taste in music, I just listen to whatever sounds good. And I'm usually finding songs that fit my stories if anything lol. Oh right, I play the piano, been playing since I was 8. I don't think I'm very good, but I'm just mindfricked because I can create an entire song with my fingers; I just think that's pretty neat.\n* **Unexplained Mysteries** \\- I like that term... Talk to me about ghosts, demons, angels, spirits, fortune reading, witchcraft, conspiracy theories, aliens, UFOs, cryptids, whatever your heart desires! I love the supernatural, and the unknown, I don't know! I love weird things, and I love talking about it with other people.\n\nI rarely sleep, so I'm always down for a conversation. Not really looking for particular people, just whoever likes any of these prompts. Fair warning: I'm a casual worker at my local casino, I'm a card dealer. So I'm not sure of scheduling. Anyways, give me 8 hours to reply back, I might be busy at work. Or I'll usually say I have work. BUT IF I DON'T, gimme 8 hours. Thank you all. &lt;3", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I\u2019m finding that I have allowed a lot of complexes and self esteem drop due to these comments. We lived together for a short stint and it was the worst experience. She constantly accused me of things, always was keeping count &amp; guilt me about money I owed her (even though I have always paid her back and even then some because I allowed her guilt tripping to get to me). I had honestly never been in such a toxic environment. But like, she has been my friend for a couple years and this all started once she started being friends with another girl who definitely has shown the same behaviors. I have gotten really upset with how she has treated me but she doesn\u2019t believe she has really done anything wrong and I\u2019m over dramatic for feeling this way. Things have cooled down but now I feel like I have to be overly nice to her and even then she takes offense to certain things. Anyone else have experience with a friend that has acted like this?

We used to spend a lot of time every day talking and doing things together but over time they've been slowly separating themselves from me. They've stopped inviting me to things, initiating conversations, having me in art they make (Everyone else is there) and more, despite that that I'm still doing all of those things for them. I believe this is because I'm the only one there that's suffering from depression and that makes me a less fun and interesting person to be around. For the past several years I've told them that I feel dis-included and unwanted but they ensured that I mattered to them as much as everyone else in lengthy, loving, and genuine sounding messages. Yet they continued to ignore and leave me behind progressively more often and acted almost like they had a grudge towards me. They'd praise everyone else's minuscule accomplishments and highlight my minuscule mistakes. They'd make new hangout groups without telling me and act like I'm invisible in conversations unless they're forced to acknowledge me. After a while I couldn't endure it anymore and started having breakdowns where I'd vent about how I felt. They'd once again ensure that it's all in my head and tell me I'm stressing them out. This became such a common occurrence that they stopped taking it seriously. Nowadays I'm no longer allowed in the group because they want it to be stress-free but I still talk to a few of them in DMs. Whenever I bring up the idea of ending our friendship for good so I can have closure they say just the right things to get me not to. As things are now, I'm miserable. Thinking about them is deeply upsetting and I want to go back to how things used to be.

I've always been the leader or mom friend in my friend group, though most of the time it was both, and I just hate how friend groups usually work. It's generally a group of people who all get along, and that's the extent of it. Fights can happen, gossiping can happen, and all sorts of issues can arise simply due to there not being a real leader to calmly sort out issues with unbiased opinion.\n\nI like the idea of being so close to a group of people that they become a family. A sense of community is very important to me, but I guess I probably take it too far. When I become friends with a new group, I stick to that one group and establish myself as leader just by taking care of everyone and making sure everyone is doing as well as possible. That much is normal, I'm pretty sure. But more and more, I've become very territorial over friends. I don't like the idea of one of my friends hanging out with a different group. It feels disloyal. And I know 100% that it's me who is wrong for thinking that, not anything bad they are doing. It's perfectly normal and fine to hang out with various people that aren't in your main friend group. I guess I just get worried that something bad will happen to them. I never express or act on these feelings, because I know my feelings are wrong, so don't worry about me being toxic or anything. I always have my friends' best interests in mind.\n\nI'm just wondering if anyone else feels this way. Is there some type of friend group that functions with slightly more primal aspects? Leader, loyalty, family, etc. I feel like I'm the only one who thinks this way.

Just this year I went to visit him and a couple other friends and had a great time. We always make jokes and have a good time and we may piss each other off but that\u2019s something that comes with experience (we don\u2019t piss each other off often anyways and if we do it\u2019s just a little). \n\nYesterday we were playing he got on his mike and he sounded really serious. I didn\u2019t think anything of it cause he just woke up and so he needs time waking up so we can be goofy and mess around. We have a group of four going and one person whistles and it wasn\u2019t me or R it was the other two. Turns out one of the two did not have a mike to talk so it was \u201cone of the three of us\u201d. And it was the dude accusing R of doing it. R was getting irritated because we kept accusing him I complimented him on it while the other kept accusing him. He turned his ps4 off out of no where and got off. I asked him if he was okay in the group chat and he said we irritated him and he wants to shower to wake up. My friend texted him without a question mark saying \u201cwe pissed you off because we said you whistled\u201d. R responded \u201cno I didn\u2019t whistle\u201d and I told him \u201cyour whistling was bomb don\u2019t hide it\u201d. R got serious and swore on something he holds dear and said he didn\u2019t do it but if we wanted to believe he did then so be it. I replied relax man we\u2019re joking with laughing emojis and my other friend also apologized and said to relax as well.\n\nFast forward to today and I find out ,while trying to send him a meme, he blocked me over Instagram, snap, text, and PlayStation. I asked him \u201cYo are we good?\u201d And then \u201cwell i hope you feel better zaddy, if you wanna talk I\u2019m here\u201d. Just to lighten the mood. I\u2019m really pissed that the one time I really pissed him off he blocks and doesn\u2019t openly talk with me. He always used to preach about being \u201creal\u201d and \u201cnot giving a fuck\u201d but today he broke his own codes. I hope I can be friends with him and set some new rules like being more direct and if I\u2019m going too far to let me know and vice verse. \n\nHowever, i don\u2019t know how to feel about this it feels way too extreme and childish asf for someone so grown. Idk if it\u2019s my perception but I used to look up to his \u201cidgaf\u201d attitude but to see him give a fuck and instead of admitting it he blocks people hurts. Idk I feel like I don\u2019t know his true opinions towards our relationship. He\u2019s a cool dude and well meaning, but at the same time he is willing to cut people off completely and try to move past it. I know who is i just want to see some perspectives on this and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come around. \n\nIf not that\u2019s more time to study, go to the gym, and live life than stay home and play video games!!!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Well a few days later I saw him at work and he acted like he didn\u2019t know me. All right, fine, really weird. I moved on and we never spoke again. Literally. I assumed I\u2019d said something to turn him off or he\u2019d assumed I was romantically interested (we\u2019re both married). Whatever. Six months later, he messages me an apology and that he was \u201cbusy\u201d be he hoped we could chat soon. So effing weird. Surprisingly though we began to chat at work and things were fine. We had a lot in common and became work buddies. Again nothing inappropriate. I forgot about  his weird initial behavior.\n\nWell recently he\u2019s just started to piss me off. He only talks to me to vent or brag, never asks me about my life, and honestly I get very little out of our friendship.

He's 31 and has been single for a couple (possibly even three) years now. For simplicity's sake, I'll call him L. L's last relationship crashed and burned quite hard. Long story short, he fell deeply in love with this girl. According to him, it was the first time he'd connected with a woman so deeply. To quote, \"I connected with her physically, emotionally, spiritually...\" They were even looking at getting married. Unfortunately, he found out that she was more in love with the prospect of simply being married, than being married to him. And thus, the relationship ended. He says he's gotten over it, but I'm not so sure.\n\nWe've often hung out late into the night, and he's brought up his opinions on the relationship (he still does have good things to say about her), but then it devolves into his opinions on relationships and the dating game in general. Most of the time, I take no issue with what he says, but its when he starts to be bitter where the worry arises. For example, his favorite saying is \"women be shopping,\" which isn't entirely wrong ( in that some women are just shopping around for boyfriends and trying on dates like you try on clothes), but it isn't exactly right in that it does to woman what radical feminists do to men (lumping individuals under the banner of their gender just because some, or a majority behave a certain way).\n\nThe reason I worry is because he'll just go on these bitter tirades about his unluckiness in love, and the direct that towards the female population in general. I'm concerned that this bitterness may seep into his very core, and come out on his next date, thereby driving women even further away from him, and exacerbating the bitterness. He's a great guy, and I don't want to see him join the ranks of angry, lonely, bitter men so often found online.  What advice do I give him?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

All sorts of interesting past too. You can be out going or shy. Shy people don't feel intimidated. We are mostly kind people and you can take your time to warm up. Most of the main members were shy at first. Just hop in and hopefully you find something you like here. I will say we are not a gaming server but do have Voice Channels and Text Channels for it.

The politics situation in my country is something that defeats even the best of spirits.\nThey make it very difficult for me to work in writing and sometimes i even think that trying is silly. \nThat's why I come with you lovely people of reddit, looking for friends to talk and cheer me up. I know that will greatly improve my condition and help me focus. \nBut do not think that we have to talk only about my writing, nor do I expect them to dedicate themselves to cheer me up as if it were a job. \nI want friends with whom to talk about whatever music / video games / that last book or show you saw and are dying to discuss with someone, I am happy to talk with you of that! ^^\n\nPS: To clarify a doubt, my first language is Spanish. And although I am much more fluent with him, I love making the effort to read and speak English to improve my ability.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

In fact, this occurence actually started us talking even more, with me being the first person she texted when she needed to talk. This continued for about another month.

She said no and then completely cut me off.\n\nI no longer have feelings for her, but I am sad that we are no longer good as friends. I talk to her occasionally, but it's just awkward small talk and doesn't lead to anything.  I've tried to reach out again, but she doesn't seem interested. I feel really guilty and stupid.

She was always at best a fair weather friend although I enjoyed her sense of humor and had a blast spending time and being silly with her.\n\nAs we began to reach middle school, our dynamic shifted to her as the popular and very socially successful pretty girl and I was her awkward sidekick. I was basically the person she would call when there was nothing to do, she never would include me with her other friends, and bullied me subtly. \n\nShe would make plans with me and then bail to hang out with her \u201ccool\u201d friends and throw it in my face for no reason. Once she and another girl who I had introduced her to, broke into my house while my family and I were on vacation. They went in my room and read and took pictures of my diary and then sent them around to other kids we had gone to school with. that was probably the worst thing she had done, but I do think she would talk behind my back, she was always cool with the people who were mote actively bullying me.\n\nSo fast forward to now... and she\u2019s asked multiple times over the last 2 years to get together. I don\u2019t want to because I have a gut feeling her intentions are selfish. Every time I give a excuse like I won\u2019t be in town at the same time she is.

I\u2019ve stopped all connection with this friend because of the way he acts. He just flipped a switch all of a sudden this year and is completely different. Like for instance us hanging out together used to consist of us talking, playing games, watching videos or movies, ect. Now when we hang out, his main goal is to make it clear that I am not his only friend, or at least that\u2019s what it seems like. \n\n\n**EXAMPLE 1:**\nI use Snapchat to communicate with most of my friends because a lot of them don\u2019t have cell service and it\u2019s easier, and when he\u2019s over and I get messages I silence my phone, turn my brightness down, and I am not obnoxious about it. When my friend spots me on Snapchat, he almost ALWAYS makes some sort of story up for no reason, it always has no bearing on anything, and always has nothing to do with anything that anybody is talking about. Like for instance, he will open up Snapchat after he spots me on it and randomly tells me something along the lines of: \u201cbro I just got a message on Snapchat\u201d or \u201cdamn, someone just sent me a pic on Snapchat\u201d  \n\n(I\u2019m gonna keep this next one short and just say exactly what happened, because this is how he acts every day so I remember it pretty vividly)\n\n**EXAMPLE 2:** \n\nI\u2019m walking around the hallway with 2 of my friends talking because we have time in between class, I walk by my friend and he sees me and we just acknowledge eachother because I have distanced myself from him as this has been going on for the entire year. We have the same class though, so I go to my class when the bell rings and I sit down, the first thing he says to me is \u201cbro after I saw you in the hallway I started walking with like 3 people\u201d\n\nSo this friend was my best friend for 5 years, we were extremely close, talked everyday, hung out most weeks, and he still wants to, only problem is the above examples I listed are what hanging out with him would consist of.\n\nWhy do I have such a big problem with this you may ask, HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND! I knew him so well and still do. Why is he trying so desperately hard to prove to me that he socializes with others? I was his best friend for 6 years, I don\u2019t care about any of this and I liked him for who he was, yet it\u2019s his prime objective any time I see him now.\n\nI want my friend back, my real friend, not whatever he has turned into. I haven\u2019t talked to him about it because I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s doing it in the first place, I just want to try to understand what he wants from me, and possibly get to the bottom of it so we can be friends again. Please someone help, I\u2019m desperate.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "edalng", "created_utc": 1576850646, "title": "Am I justified in wanting to end this friendship?", "author": "toebeans_club", "self_text": "Basically, I just came back from a short holiday with a close friend I've known for about a decade and she acted in a way that's bringing up bad memories of other times when she's been mean, and I'm seriously thinking if it's time to let this friendship go.\n\nQuick backstory. So I've known this person (Z) for a long time. Z and I have been friends since high school and we've stayed in touch despite going to universities in different countries and having different friend circles. We're both studying for different professional degrees - but she's a medical student. Very smart, confident, comes from a well-off family, clearly going places in her life.\n\nWe both have strong personalities, and I've always considered her a close friend. But whenever I'm around her, I stop being outspoken and sort of become a more passive person. She's a more assertive person than I am, and part of it might be because we always speak in my second language due to where we both live, which I'm pretty fluent in but definitely not at the level of how I speak English.\n\nWe've known each other for almost ten years, and honest to god there have been several times when I wanted to distance myself from her for different 'incidents'. One summer during uni when I flew back home and met up with her, we'd both just finished the first year of our respective degrees and she was telling me how she wanted to join Doctors Without Borders or work exclusively in public hospitals, never private. I said that sounded great, and (naturally) she asked me what I wanted to do when I graduated. I said I wanted to qualify and join a commercial firm, get a job that paid well so I could start helping my parents out with financial stuff, and she gave me such shit about how I shouldn't be helping big corporations and be more like her because she was going to work in public hospitals and \"actually do some good in the world\". There I was, 19 years old, sitting across from an old friend in the middle of a restaurant, getting berated about what to do with my degree and my life by someone who had zero experience in that field. At the time, I was so shocked that she'd act that way and seriously considered not speaking to her/seeing her, but eventually she reached out and asked to meet up and things went back to normal.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to present day. We're both getting close to graduation and having to study for stressful final exams. We've met up for dinner and are discussing our schedules, and Z tells me how she's been planning to go on holiday with one of her med student friends for a short trip between exams. Sounds great, except the med student friend wants to go to a city that Z thinks is boring, and to meet up with an old high school friend that Z doesn't know. Z's logic is that she only has two days off for this holiday, probably the last holiday she'll ever get before she starts working, so she doesn't want to spend it in a boring city and seeing/staying with a person she doesn't know. As luck would have it, I've found out my exam schedule and it turns out I have free time during that exact period as well. Z and I both agree she shouldn't ditch her med student friend because Z did ask her first, and then nothing happens for a week.\n\nZ messages me out of the blue saying things fell through with her med student friend and do I want to go to Shanghai with her? (We live in Asia, so it's not really that far away for a short trip) I say yes, and we book hotels and flights, but apart from her saying she really wants to go to this shopping area in Shanghai, neither of us really know much about the place.\n\nA week before the trip while I'm studying for my finals, I get a message from her asking if I can plan the itinerary because Z's super busy with her own finals. Fair enough. We're both busy but med students are busier. I do my research, ask people for recs, Google Map the shit out of the plan, type up an organized itinerary for our two days, and I send it her way. She says she loves the itinerary and thanks me. Great.\n\nThe day of the trip is when things start to get iffy. We agree to meet at the airport, and when she turns up, several issues are apparent. 1) she's wearing fashionable shoes which are flat but not exactly the best for walking around the city as the itinerary calls for; 2) she has a tiny crossbody purse as her travel bag (apart from a suitcase); and 3) she left her real phone at home on purpose and brought a crappy one she borrowed off someone else because she didn't want the police seizing her phone. But it's not a huge deal, and everything goes smoothly.\n\nWhen we get to Shanghai, more red flags. Z's phone has data service but since it's borrowed she doesn't want to use the data to download a map app that works in China. Luckily I got a SIM card that works and I already have the app loaded on my phone, so we won't be stranded without maps. But I didn't find out from her until we got to Shanghai, which sort of sucks because she could have given me advance warning that I'd be solely responsible for navigation and transport on a holiday that's meant to be relaxing for both of us. Another thing is that she can't speak Mandarin (which I expected) or read simplified Chinese (did not expect because she can read traditional Chinese) so I really would be responsible for any communication on the trip - transport, buying food, etc. She also gives me shit for bringing too many things out for the trip when all I'm carrying is a small backpack big enough to put the things I need - umbrella, scarf, bottle of water, passport, wallet - while she has her tiny crossbody purse and asks me if I can fit her camera into my bag (no, I couldn't). But again, I don't say a word and we get to the hotel, check in, drop our bags, no issues. \n\nMy itinerary had food options planned near the attractions we wanted to get to (and I figured that it wouldn't be a big deal, either street food or nearby restaurants would be fine), but because Z has a friend who lived in Shanghai, she got food recommendations off of her and insisted that we HAD to try them. I also did tell Z in advance that I have a crab allergy (which is a big part of Shanghai food) because she kept saying she wanted to try this and that local dish with crab. Anyway, the first stop involves a 30-minute detour by foot to get to this local chain restaurant in the opposite direction of where we're meant to be going, but I get us there using my phone. It's lunch hour and this place (which is fast food, basically) is crowded. Z can't read the menu so she says she'll grab us seats while I stay up front at the counter where people make their orders. \n\nI admit the next part was me being sort of dumb. I saw that the menu had a crab dish that Z said she wanted to try, and there's a bunch of people behind me in the line so I just decide to order in one go so I don't have to come back. I order this local dish with crab and another without it for myself, and then I wait until the order is ready for pick up and I bring it over. The whole thing took maybe 10ish minutes. So I go over to Z at the table and I put the food in front of her and say \"hey, I got you \\[crab dish\\], hope that's OK --\" and before I've even finished talking she's like \"What the hell took so long? You got me the crab version? I wanted the regular. Don't you know you're supposed to ask people what they want? I got us seats but you were supposed to come back and ask me what I wanted from the menu - what the hell?\" I figure I've messed up, so I immediately offer to swap meals with her but Z already looks super pissed and she says \"you can't eat crab, so I have to eat this and you can only eat the regular version\". I apologize (a lot) and say \"I didn't know, I'm really sorry Z. Are you sure you don't want to swap?\" She ignores me and starts eating in a really pissy way and doesn't speak to me for the rest of lunch, even though I offer a few times to swap or get her something she really wants. The part where I gave up was after I offered a piece of my lunch (in case she wanted to try the taste) and she just gave me this really angry look and said \"I'm already full eating the version with crab, so no.\" I figure that whatever I say won't help so I just pull out my phone and start looking up how to get to our next stop. Eventually we finish eating and I suggest our travel options: forty-ish minutes by foot or cab. She chooses cab because her feet are already hurting (not wearing the right shoes will do that to you), and the ride over is still very silent, but when we get to the attraction she starts talking to me normally again so I figure everything's fine. No harm done.\n\nFast forward to the next morning, when we set off to get breakfast on the way to catch the Metro. I'm navigating again, and on the way I'm pointing out breakfast options to her. We pass a restaurant with the soup dumplings (xiaolongbao) she said she HAD to have while we were in Shanghai and I point it out to her - \"hey, that's what you wanted to eat, right?\" All of a sudden she snaps: \"I don't understand why you're so pissed about the soup dumplings, I said I wanted them for lunch but that doesn't mean I want them for both breakfast AND lunch. It's like lunch yesterday with the crab dish, just because I said I wanted to eat that crab dish doesn't mean you should order it without asking me. You keep saying 'you want to eat this' and it's so mean, I don't understand why you keep doing that\". At this point I stop walking and I'm looking at her completely shocked, because I thought I was paying attention to what she wanted to eat by suggesting where we could go to get it. Also, we've had lunch and dinner at this point and at both meals, she's ordered some local crab dish that she told me she wanted to eat. Is it a huge leap in logic to think that she wants to eat crab, the thing Shanghai is famous for? I guess so.\n\nBut she's getting really mad at me, and I don't want to fight with her on vacation, so I apologize. A lot. Literally, we were standing in the middle of a street with people on their morning commute and I'm repeatedly apologizing for offending her and asking what I can do to make it better. But she won't/can't tell me how I can make it up to her and just keeps looking really mad, so I end up apologizing if the way I speak made her feel bad. I'm not even sure how I made a mistake, apart from maybe I put the wrong emphasis on a word in my second language a few times and it came off passive-aggressive to her. At the same time, I get this feeling that this is how she is with her boyfriend - she's told me that she gets mad about things that he does and every time he always apologizes first, contrite to the max, and does something to make up for it.\n\nBut since I'm not Z's boyfriend, and I've apologized a lot before 9AM, I figure the way not to offend Z accidentally is to be quiet and careful about what I say. So we go about the rest of the itinerary and I pretty much just agree with whatever she wants to do and eat. My function is a navigator and walking clock to make sure we don't run behind on our schedule. I also provide commentary on gifts Z wants to buy for her boyfriend (when she asks, of course) and I wait for her outside the changing room of an expensive boutique while she tries on different evening gowns for an event she has coming up and take pictures and stand there for her to bounce ideas off of. Luckily, we avoid another fight, but I pretty much spent the rest of the trip in walking-on-eggshells mode, which was not fun.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed Shanghai as a place but I'm seriously shaken that she'd get so pissed about something kind of small and then drop it on me suddenly even after I apologized (a lot). I felt like she really wanted to be on the trip with someone like her boyfriend, not me, who'd do all the planning and take care of her and let her walk all over him (he's a nice guy, very doting). And to be honest, this trip reminded me of all those times over the years that something completely shocking happened between us that made me feel terrible about myself, and I wanted to stop talking to her. I felt exhausted after two days with her and was genuinely happy to get home to the pile of studying I had to do.\n\nSo I guess I'm just wondering - I'm not in high school anymore, I'm about to graduate and start working, is it time to cut this friendship out of my life?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "edbocd", "created_utc": 1576856031, "title": "My longest friend", "author": "ztayfig", "self_text": "I'll try to make a long story short. My longest friend, off and on a good one, over the last ten years and I have had a very difficult relationship since I started dating my boyfriend about 1.5 year ago. We became friends in high school and  now are in our mid twenties. I dated earlier in our friendship but can't really remember if that caused issues but we just weren't really as close. After that, college and then I moved a couple hours away. We got really close during this time but I wasn't the happiest version of myself during this time and relied on her a lot. After I moved back home, I met my boyfriend and our friendship took a nose dive. I still tried to make plans and tried to combine me and her time with my relationship too. She's been in a relationship the entire time we've been friends so it felt natural that we would do things with our boyfriends but this entire time she has never once done something with just him and I. She'd always make excuses for that saying we haven't been together long enough or were too \"coupley\" which we are definitely enthralled with each other but not in a in your face way. Also, we use to drink a lot together in the past and I'm not into that as much as I was at 21/22 and this has been an issue. To the point that when were together she gets angry at me for not getting drunk? So within the last 1.5 years she's at least 8 times blew up at me, always via text, telling me I've changed and our friendship deterioration is all my fault and she's exactly the same, etc. The most recent time I called her out of the blue to tell her I missed her and we should do something soon. we both had parties the next night but we were gonna try to see each other after. At the party around 8 I checked my phone and she had called and texted me a couple times saying she was upset we talked about hanging out cause she's clearly second on my list. I told her I was at my party and planning on calling her after and she got on to the whole I've changed, new relationship, new me, all that shit. In the meantime, she never tries to make plans. Ever. I couldn't tell you the last time she called or texted me first. Additionally, my boyfriend just bought a house that's going to be our first home together. The extent that we've talked about it was to tell her about it when we got dinner a couple months ago and then update her on the process (mainly cause i thought not hearing about it would piss her off). She told me that how much I talked about it was like beating a dead horse. she told me she was jealous maybe a month ago and that apparently meant I wasn't allowed to talk about it.\nNot that she talks to me about it but she says shes going through a rough time and that she needs me.\n\nThe people I trust for advice think that our relationship season is over and it's time to move on.

Fast forward time, I made it out on my own. I found my own apartment, pay my own rent, &amp; run my own business full time. I have extremely limited time because this is the life of a small business owner, at least in the beginning.\n\nIn comes my friend, who is still struggling &amp; I just don't understand why or how. \n\n\\- Unlike me, she qualified for a program that paid her rent for the entire year, so she doesn't have that burdon. All she has to pay is utilities, her phone bill, &amp; Wifi.\n\n\\- Secondly, she can never hold a job. A new job will last a maximum of 3/4 months MAYBE. She has a hot temper &amp; just can't handle work related issues. \n\n\\- The first thing she decided to get when she got her apartment was a puppy. She has no funds to be a proper pet parent, and has below zero patience with him. She complains that she has no money to buy him food, and when she does come over she brings the dog who destroys my apartment because he's not trained. Then comes the challenge of her going back home, she lives an hour away, and because the dog is so big she can't use public transportation. It always seems to be something with her.\n\n\\- I enrolled in a food assistance program that gives me $100 a month to buy food. Being that I'm self employed, my income varies. This friend insists that I split it with her so she can buy food. She sends me texts saying she's hungry I don't have this or that...meanwhile I don't understand why she doesn't apply to the exact program so she can get it too if that's the case. She currently isn't working so the amount she gets will surpass mine, why does she want me to split the little I have when she can go out &amp; get her own??\n\n\\- I loaned her a total of $265 to pay her utility bill 2 months ago, and I have received nothing back. Before that, I gave her my old bed and my old dresser because I wanted new furniture for my new apartment. She came over and helped me wrap it all up and I drove it to her apartment. I have a feeling she still wouldn't have a bed if I didn't give her my old one.\n\nI don't know what to do with this friend. She is feeling more like a burden than a friend. Constantly in need of something but yet no drive to figure it out. It's almost as if because we came from the same struggle, I'm suppose to just give her half of what I worked for. Add in me running my own business, I have zero time for stupidity and I find myself not even responding to her for hours, sometimes days. \n\nShould I talk to her? Or should I just drop her - because honestly I am a champion of ghosting people. She is extremely emotional and sometimes I believe she is suffering from bipolar - but this can't continue. She is my friend. Not my girlfriend, not my grandmother, not my child or my puppy. There would be no negative feeling because she takes way more than she gives, so I wouldn't feel anything. \n\nI just want to make sure it's not me being the isolated being that I naturally am.

{"post_id": "edhj19", "created_utc": 1576882845, "title": "Losing a childhood friend over weed", "author": "thecrazydumpling", "self_text": "The title is definitely super vague so let me explain further. I have had a friend for more than 20 years now and we have always been close. During sophomore year in college, I introduced her to weed. Im a recreational smoker, and she wanted to try it, so we smoked and she had a great time. At the time, she went to a different, more isolated college. She hated it and was looking for an outlet. Since she liked our experience, she continued to smoke more frequently and found a sense of solace through bud. About a year and a half later, she got caught with it on campus. She had a couple court hearings, and fortunately she had to do community service hours rather than spend time being incarcerated. She put the court papers in the glove compartment of her car, and continued smoking weed. After a while, the college that she was at became overwhelming for her mental health and she moved back home. She saw a couple therapists and was prescribed antidepressants. Weed continued to be an outlet, and she relied more heavily on it. Fast forward a couple years... and her dad had found the court papers that she stashed in the glove compartment. He reacted irrationally, threatened to kick her out of the house, made her flush her weed, and forcefully had her admitted into a type of rehab program. Over time her mental health had improved and slowly started to rebuild her trust with her father. She became more responsible with weed and cut back so she did not rely on it, but she still used it recreationally. I would be hesitant to smoke with her, but I saw major improvement and noticed that she was more responsible with it so I would agree to do it with her. Recently, she asked if we could smoke and go for dinner. I agreed and went over to her place. Her father had arrived from work and I could feel that there was a type of tension in the house. We went for a walk to smoke and during this she told me that he had smelled weed from her bathroom, where she rolled the joint. She used the excuse that it was her bath bomb. He also mentioned smelling that in her car 3 times over the span of 6 months (I did not smoke with her these times). The next day, she called me and told me that he was incredibly suspicious and ordered the same bath bomb to see if it smelled like what he smelled in the bathroom. She said that she wanted to come clean and would throw me under the bus. She eventually did and now I'm not allowed to see her since her dad made her cut ties with me and she's under house arrest until she finishes up her credits which would be in 2 or 3 years. \n\nIm not sure what I should be feeling. On one hand, I personally would never throw my friends/family under the bus since I would know that it would compromise our friendship. Her dad isn't concerned with me as much as he's concerned with her smoking. Involving me hasn't really cushioned her fall. But including me in this situation has forced her to compromise her friendship with me... 20 years worth of friendship. But on the other hand I feel as if I enabled her by introducing her to weed  in the first place, and agreeing to smoke with her in the most recent situation. I feel like shit and I truly feel the loss of a friend. What should I be feeling? Is it my fault?\n\nThanks in advance to those who reply, I truly appreciate it", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Lately I have been struggling with family issues and my puppy that we just got, who was only 6 months old passed away, and my sister just having heart surgery. I stopped replying to my friend around early November because I was really upset and Iv'e also been taking care of my sick mom. Once I was ready to talk to her again I messaged her telling her the reason I stopped replying suddenly was because my puppy passed away and because of my sister having her surgery, and that I didn't want her to think I was ignoring her, I was sorry for not replying, etc. I sent her a super long paragraph and several others but whenever I tried sending everything my messages would turn to green or the'yd be blue, and the bottom of the message would be blank not indicating weather they sent or not. I was really confused so I kept trying to message her and nothing would work, so I finally googled something to see if I could fix the problem. Every website I went to said that if you're messages are green or blue and they don't say delivered at the bottom then your'e blocked, but she also could have been having WiFi issues or was out of service, so I tried not to worry about it to much. I even talked to another family member about it and they said that usually when your message is green it means you're blocked, and they told me to just wait it out and if I never hear from her to just give up. So I waited and waited thinking she'd eventually respond, and she did finally message me yesterday saying she missed me and had so much to tell me. I messaged her back saying I had tried to reach out to her but every time I would get a green message and sometimes it would be blue and show nothing at the bottom. She then goes to say she's been trying to message ME for weeks but that they would never send and even said she sent me a message on Facebook Messenger but when I checked my messenger I didn't see anything from her. I even sent her a screenshot of all the messages I tried sending and she left one of them on read in one of the screenshots which was weird, and when i asked her about it she's like 'I never read that wtf\" and said \"that's really weird\" and i'm all like \"yeah I was confused and I thought I was blocked or something\" I honestly thought she had been busy because it is the holiday season and people are usually busy during this time of year and I told her that, and she tells me she's tried messaging everyday for weeks , that she's always on her phone, but I never received any messages from her at all on my phone. The only message I got was my phone notifying me that it was unable to deliver to her contact name. I would open up my messages and they would all say \"not delivered\" with a red icon next to it in green and some were just blue with nothing underneath. Before I told her all of this she's like \"I don't get why you disappear for months\" and I'm like \"well I thought you were just busy with things it's the holiday season so and didn't want to bother you, but I also never got any  anything from you either\". I found it kind of weird that when I would send her screenshots to show her and long messages telling her what I think happened, she would just ignore all those and asked me about my puppy instead, and when she asked me why I wasn't able to take her to the vet i'm like \"well it's because my mom's disabled and can't drive and there was no one else available to take her\" and all she said was \"oh\" which idk what that means. I'm just confused because I don't get why I couldn't message her this whole time even though she says she's tried messaging me for weeks and even tried Instagram DMS at one point and I told her I don't have Instagram anymore. Like I never received any messages from her, and when I tried showing her proof (like screenshots of my messages) she'd ignore that and wanted to know why I just disappeared for months, even though I already told her about my dog and my sister several times, but she would go back to the same topic every time I brought that up, making me feel super guilty and selfish about the whole thing. Also when I tried sending her more screenshots she just stopped responding even though she told me she's always on her phone. Sorry if this is super confusing but I'm not sure what to do. Have I been a bad friend even though I've tried reaching out and getting in contact with her? Like I would never  ignore her like that and I feel so bad :(", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

What do I do?", "author": "pissballs102020", "self_text": "I'm 24, male, and an only child. Please, please help me. I know this is a lot to read, but this is some deep shit and I really am looking for advice, or just.. anything. You have no idea how much you'd help me.\n\nMy story is, my biological parents got divorced when I was 0, and I have no siblings. I was relatively happy up until 12. I would go see my dad every other weekend and wednesdays, and would stay with my mom majority of time. At 12, my mom met my stepdad who is a complete ass and I couldn't stand the thought of living with them at 12. I then turned 13, went through another custody battle and my mom ended up with majority time still (which sucked because I never wanted that, and the courts favor the mother), but my dad got every weekend in addition if I wanted to go there, so I took it. I lived with my dad mostly until 14, and he ended up meeting this woman, who also sucks, and got married to her when I was 15. Edit: This is long and rambly, I'm sorry, I just had to get it out, it's been on my mind way too much lately. It's late and my punctuation and everything is off but please, if you bare with me you it will help so much. \n\nFor fucking 12 years now, I have been uncomfortable, felt awkward, and not myself in both of my homes. My stepparents have completely taken over the house and through all the fighting, counseling, tears, and distraught, my parents are still with these people, and I've just come to the conclusion that they don't really give a fuck. I'm afraid to even SPEAK in my own home because I know my step parents will make SMARTASS comments, and I want NOTHING to do with them. I don't know how to sum this all up, I just can't type everything it'd be too long, but I promise you, they SUCK, and my parents could have done better. My stepdad is worse than my stepmom, so he will be brought up more. I'm not kidding, I watch the pitch of my voice because I know if I even speak up a little louder because I don't want my stepparents to hear me and make a comment, or I just don't speak at all, what kind of fucking home is that. I HAVEN'T BEEN MYSELF IN BOTH OF MY HOMES SINCE FUCKING 12. THERE IS NO OUTLET.\n\nFrom 12-18 as a kid, I had so many less people over, so many more fights at home, so many awkward moments, so much hate, danger, tension, depression, everything in the books. So many lonely nights in my room, with not a soul to reach, just playing xbox to death or getting bored on the internet. If I ever wanted to have someone over it'd have to be okay with my stepparent. I miss the days before 12 when my parents seemed to care and I could have people over whenever and all of our relationships were so much more... they were just happy. Now? Even at 24, after going through college and coming home for the holidays, which I skipped a lot of holidays btw because I never wanted to come home to these monsters, it all still feels the same. I can't take it anymore. I skip meals because I can't even walk into the kitchen and pass my stepdad, I wait to hear him leave from my room. I can't tell you how much weight I've lost, and how many meals I've skipped. I do this all time, yes, I would rather starve than go out in the hall and even see him. He even judges me when I eat too much. Fuck you. Absolutely fuck you. I'm 135 pounds of fucking bone now you piece of shit. Same with my stepmom, all they fucking care about is the money spent on food, fuck you, fuck fucking you. You're not my fucking parent, and I will eat because I FUCKING HAVE TO. There's only goddamn one of me! I mean, it comes down to necessities of human life that they stress me out with. My parents don't do shit when I bitch to them about both my stepparents, they just say they'll talk to them, ok, ok, then a few quiet awkward days go past and it all goes back to the same old bullshit. I hate hearing my step dad laugh and talk loudly, like he is comfortable in this house while I fucking rot in my room, miserable and unhappy. It makes me fume. When guests or my moms sisters come over, he puts on a fucking bubbly act, then when the doors shut, he goes right back to being a disparaging ass. I was this close to walking out there today and saying oh you sure like to put on an act when guests are around don't you? But I didn't.\n\nI never use to leave my room when I was a kid, I would always wait for them to leave the area or drive somewhere before I went out. I always listen to their voice and footsteps when I'm home. It's constantly awkward, and I honestly feel like this reality is just a joke now, like whoever decides fate, made my life a joke on purpose, it's impossible to explain. I hate all of my fucking \"parents\". Worthless fucks. The saddest part? My parents will never divorce these monsters. They'll be with until they die. I've already accepted that. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm not a kid and I'm slowly, very fumbly, getting my shit together as an adult, but it sucks because I feel like I almost have no parents, no siblings, distant cousins, just about nothin. The only positive about all this fucking bullshit, is that at 24 now, I'm a hell of a lot stronger. I have stood up to my parents and stepparents in the past, but in the like last 2 years, it has gotten serious. I've put them on hush mode, made the fucking house mine (some days), and made everyone worry about me. It felt fucking empowering. All those years of misery, to come up in short, powerful moments. I'm starting to snap more and more. I snapped hard 5 days ago at my step dad and called him fucking disgusting, and told him that he's really pissing me the fuck off. I say fuck A LOT. He didn't even respond or look me in the eye, he just stared at the tv. Finally got him to shut up. But, like I said, few awkward days past, and it's right back to their shitty personalities because my parents don't WANT to change. Now I'm starting to brainstorm a llooooot more. The cards are in my hands now. I threaten suicide because what's the fucking point anymore? My family is dead to me. You want to lose your only son? Of course you don't, you couldn't live with that, and I really will off myself. I will get up and push my step dad against the fucking wall like he did when I was 16 if I have to, because he's fucking weak now, and I know that. I've gotten a lot stronger. I'll throw shit at him, I'll yell until the neighbors hear me. I'm not this shy, scared 12 year old anymore that you got off too when picking on. The tables have been turning, and I fucking like it. Now, for example, when I got mad at him the other day, I haven't come out of my room much, it's too god damn awkward. I hate when we asks the one question of the day like where did you eat? Or some bullshit like that. I hate when my mom goes and runs errands and leaves me here. BTW I'm recovering from wisdom teeth surgery so I'm a little crippled atm lol. But anyways, this has a been a theme for years, and I'm not sure what to ultimately do here.\n\nOn one hand, my real parents, especially my mom, are all I got, really, and my psychologist who I love to death. Also, I WANT a relationship with my real parents, that's all I ever use to know, but it just hurts so fucking much and i'm constantly torn on what to do. SO.. guys.. once I'm financially stable, do I never come back here? Do I cut off my parents completely, phone numbers, everything? They've had their chances, and I swear it's over. Well, they still have chances but I'm not a kid anymore so I think they sort of \"got away with it\" and waited til I was 18, which really does not sit well with me. Should I go kick my stepdads ass? Should I raise hell, and break a bunch of shit? Should I go in his room and destroy everything until he gets in his fucking car and at leasts leaves for the rest of christmas/new years? Should I talk to the police? (Not sure what they could really do, I'm an adult now). I yearn to feel like I use to when they weren't around..I feel hopeless most days, that's for sure, but I'm powerful on my own. What kills me is deep down, it's like my parents never really cared for my happiness, and it fucking hurts so fucking bad. I'm a lone wolf. Like I said, I WANT a relationship with my parents, I WANT to love them so deeply like I use to, but it's just too hard living in the same home with these monsters. It just won't ever work.

Pretty much, my family is constantly stuck in a series of unfortunate events where money always seems to just go away. My mom works at Burger King and used to work at Subway before, but she's quitting and thinking about working back at Subway. My dad always have on and off jobs at gas stations, but robberies tend to happen or my dad gets fired. To pick up the slack, I got into a local public university that offered me a full ride, so I could graduate debt-free, but it seems as though I really didn't.\n\nI got a job offer from a company which is a 45 minute commute from my home, and they're offering me an $83,000 salary, which is great (given that I graduate). Except the thing is, I don't want to live at home. I grew up in a pretty abusive household and every time I come back home from school (I live in a dorm), I'm nearly driven insane by the constant fighting which has become my background noise as of lately. I've been back home 4 days and I pretty much am battling breakdown all the time. My uncle and aunt have just emigrated with their 4 year old daughter who has developmental issues, and it's like watching my life with my parents unfold all over again. My little sister is 16 and doesn't really get an escape from home, so I want to have my own place to provide her that, and I can't even drive her and take her anywhere because we only have one working car.\n\nHowever, I'm scared about how to budget for the real world and I don't want to fall into the same cycles as my father, but I really want to help get this weight off his shoulders. Not only that but my parents have such big dreams that I want to fulfill for them. I carry a part time job while in school so that they don't have to pay my finances so much, but I make about $100 every other week since school is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\nSchool has been really hard lately since as a child I used to do really well, but life is starting to take it's toll, and my grades have been falling. I used to be an all A student, but now I struggle to pass some of my hardest classes. Two of my grandparents have passed away within the last two years and I dealt with a lot of pain since I'd only seen them both as a baby, and the other a second time when my grandparents flew to visit my mother while she was pregnant. I've been having a hard time coping with this because I wish I had more time with them, but they lived in my parents home country. I'm having a hard time holding it together, and I had been using substances to cope (an expensive habit) and trying to go to therapy and seeing a psychiatrist. My anti-depressants and birth control have been costing me a lot ($55 a month). I've failed to reach the Dean of Students and asking for extra help at the sake of persevering regardless of circumstance, which I deeply regret. I'm at the final stretch, but it's just really hard.\n\nAnything or any help is appreciated", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Don't get me wrong, he's great, but I'd love to make some friends for once.\n\nI always struggled socially. Never had much friends. My mental health issues started in my teens (14/15) and I've lost my only friend because she said she doesn't see a point in meeting up with me anymore because I'm clearly more interested in myself and my stupid issues than 'being there for her'. \n\nYear later I've met amazing group of friends. We were a sailing group. Although we had good contact with each other, I was very often excluded/not invited to parties or to hang out. \n\n Then I left my home country to do uni when i was 19 and ended up very lonely. \nMy friend group cut contact with me. I tried to contact them, but it ended up very one sided (it was always me who was sending messages, also barely got any other answeres than short words/an emoji).\n\nI tried to make friends at university, but because of my issues I had no choice but to drop out after few failed modules. I thought I made a friend there, but she cut me off as soon as I told her I won't graduate and had to drop out ( I was doing a rather snobby course - graphic design). It hurt because I was always there for her with some advice and help. She used to call me in the middle of the night with her problems asking for advice.\n\nThen I tried to help out my work colleague. We are from the same country and she has problems with English-language. I started teaching her every week and was taking very little money for a few hour session (which she always offered to me). I was taking care of her daughter over summer holidays (mimd you I had to commute). Then one day when I changed jobs I told her I can't come tonight because of work and haven't seen her for few months ever since (as she says she's constantly busy and has no time, she also dropped our lessons). \n\nHow to make friends? How to meet those people that would want to hang out with you? Where can I meet those people? \nAlso, it might be a useful information: I currently live in the UK.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'd say about 6 years now. We met through a mutual friend and found each other on Facebook right away, Throughout the years, we liked and commented on each other's statuses. And I supported her at-home business by becoming a customer of hers. We got even closer during this time and she's even coached me for job interviews. Emma was also the reason I even got married to my current husband. I had previously been scared of marriage and she convinced me I should do it.\n\nAround this time last year, tragedy struck Emma. She had been having trouble getting pregnant for along time. But she finally got pregnant and her baby was born prematurely. The baby died after only 5 days. She actually didn't even tell me she was pregnant. So imagine my shock when I found this out through my fiance (who was also friends with her on Facebook), who had found out about her baby's death on FB. I then asked a mutual friend about it and the friend confirmed it. Emma apparently told this friend about the pregnancy, but not me. The friend said Emma didn't want to tell a lot of people about it because it was high risk. So fine, I accepted this. I knew she knew this particular friend for longer than me and was probably more comfortable sharing this information with her.\n\nDespite my shock, my fiance and I decided to attend the memorial service she held for her baby. I found out that most people there did know about Emma's pregnancy. But again, these were friends she had known since she was in high school. So I didn't let it bother me that I was left in the dark. Emma later sent me a text and thanked me for coming. She said she valued our friendship, despite the fact that we don't talk all that much.\n\nA few weeks later, I asked Emma to be a bridesmaid at my wedding. She declined, saying she didn't think she'd be a good bridesmaid right not, since she could barely even get out of bed. She apologized and said she felt really bad, but was honored that I asked her. I understood. Still, I sent her an invitation to the wedding (as well as invited her to my bridal shower and bachelorette party). She never responded, but I understood why. I just thought she appreciate the invitation. I had been through the tragedy of losing both my parents many years ago, yet I still wanted my friends to invite me out. I figured Emma would be the same way. I won't pretend to know what losing a child is like though.\n\nI didn't text Emma for a few months after I got married, as I got busy with my own life and figured she needed some space anyway. But noticed she was posting really sad stuff about losing a baby, as well as things about her own late child nearly everyday on FB. Other than occasionally reacting with a sad button, I didn't comment because I didn't know what to say. But about a month ago, I noticed Emma disappeared from FB and my husband could no longer see her profile either. We assumed she needed a break and deactivated. I texted her later that day to ask if she was ok, but got no response. I brought it up to a mutual friend and said friend told me she was looking at Emma's profile right now. Yet I still couldn't find her and neither could hubby. I later asked a friend who didn't even know Emma to look her up. And what do you know! This friend was able to view Emma's profile. That means Emma blocked husband and I.\n\nI understand Emma has been through hell and back. But I'd be lying if I said this didn't hurt. And I can't understand why someone I tried really hard to be there for and after many years of friendship would cut ties with me without so much as an explanation (I'm guessing she blocked my husband to keep me from looking at her profile through him). Was going to the funeral and sending an occasional text (while still trying to give her space) not enough for Emma? Was I being too pushy by asking her to be a bridesmaid and still inviting her to wedding events? As I said, I thought I was doing the right thing there. I thought she would've felt worse if I left her out.\n\nI thought about writing Emma a letter asking her about why she decided to cut me off (I think she blocked my number too, as my texts have been going unanswered and it only rings a couple of times when I call). However, I wouldn't expect to hear back from her. I also thought about sending her a card just thanking her for everything she's done for me (most importantly, encouraging me to get married). Thought maybe I could send a little gift too (not sure what I'd give her). But if she blocked me from all forms of contact, maybe I'm better off just letting her go? Just would like to know why she would possibly do this and what the best thing to do here would be.\n\nThanks in advance!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm 16 and she's 24, is the age gap for friends weird?", "author": "throwingawaysoon04", "self_text": "I absolutely love English as a subject and the class is quite chill and the teacher is really good. I often go to her after school classes for an hour about 3-4 times a week to study and we often end up talking instead of studying. Sometimes I go there to study things unrelated to English because I prefer her to my other teachers and she still manages to be super helpful. She's actually pretty cool surprisingly and isn't as weird and boring as I imagine most teachers are. We talk about all kinds of things and I genuinely enjoy talking to her. She's also super helpful whenever I need help with something and sees potential in me and told me I should become a writer, which I plan to try and pursue. She has mentioned I'm quite grown mentally for my age as I'm 16 which is probably why we get along so well and she has helped me feel a little better about myself in general. I do really like talking to her but I worry that the line has been crossed and I don't want her to risk losing her job. Like I understand the line of being friends with a student is not allowed, but she seems to be getting kinda jealous of my best friend lately which is more confusing.\n\nSometimes my teacher sits next to me in after school classes and we just chat away about unrelated things but I think that's pretty harmless. What isn't is I think she has become kinda protective over me. A while back she moved my best and only friend into another class and said she was distracting me, which fair enough maybe she was a little. But I was going to after school classes anyway so I always caught up. Then I basically had no friends in my class and I'm kinda shy so it wasn't great for me. Not too long after that she told the class they can start sitting wherever they want so I ended up sitting in the front near her desk because I had nobody else. I don't mind much of course, but I just wish my best friend was in my class and I feel she did this because she knew I'd move to the front of the class because I had nowhere else to go. I do like my teacher though, she's a cool person but it just felt kinda unnecessary and a little manipulative. I don't know for certain if this was her intention but I just get that feeling. Also afterwards during one of our after school classes she asked me about my love life and asked if I was dating my best friend which I'm not and she seemed genuinely surprised that we weren't dating. I think she disliked my friend because she thought we were dating but I'm not sure. My teacher also has called staff from the office to collect my friend for misbehaving before because she returned to her old English class and sat next to me and refused to go to her new one. \n\nI want to hear your honest opinions of what do you think of all this? Do you think she's just being a protective friend by trying to look out for me, or maybe she's just acting broody like a mother/big sister or that she might like me a little more than she admits? Should I try to avoid my teacher by going to less of her after school classes? I do really like her but I'm a little different to most people my age and like to think logically and something about this friendship feels off. Also before you mention this teacher might like me, as vain as it sounds it has crossed my mind several times but for as long as I'm in high school I'm not going to do or say anything to risk it as this person positively impacts my life quite a lot just by being a friend to me. Her career is also very important and I don't want her to lose that either. I don't 100% know her intentions but how do I ensure this stays a healthy friendship at least until I finish high school just in case?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Advice/help would be appreciated?", "author": "cherryspritz", "self_text": "Hello all! \nMy friend in question does not use Reddit so I\u2019m not too worried about them finding this. Like title says, I\u2019ve known her since Grade 8 for me and Grade 9 for her (she\u2019s one year older.) (8 years)\n\nI don\u2019t know where I stand with her sometimes. She has big mental health issues, depression, I think lots of unresolved trauma she doesn\u2019t want to try to help herself through, anxiety, body dysmorphia- it\u2019s possible she has BPD. All my friendship with her, negativity has been a constant force. When we were teenagers, it was there, and now as we are young adults it\u2019s intensified and turned into hopelessness/no drive. My own mental health problems, I constantly work at to keep me okay. I\u2019ve always been the listener friend up until around the last two years, when I realized I was absorbing her mannerisms and it was really affecting me negatively, draining me and changing my thought patterns about myself. From that point on, I decided I couldn\u2019t do it to myself to stay the same in the friendship, and I think since then we\u2019ve been struggling to find a good balance. As of late, I feel very \u201coff\u201d in this friendship because this was someone I really loved to be around, but it doesn\u2019t always feel so natural now. \n\nMy father passed in 2017 and it affected me greatly. I\u2019ve only really felt that now, at the end of 2019, I feel that I have a purpose again in life and I have plans, goals, hope and also, honest personal happiness. I\u2019ve come to terms with who I am, and I\u2019ve also come to terms with what I want to become and how I want to change.  It\u2019s not at all set in stone, but I\u2019m feeling better. \nMy friend is someone who can never feel these things or believe in them or herself. She draws so much negativity to her life in many ways, through self deprecation or second guessing herself or just never having anything good to be thankful for. \nEveryone in my immediate family was/is still depressed. It might be that my threshhold for staying around people with SUPER SUPER bad emotional states is too far gone. Everyone has bad days, and I can always sympathize or theorize why someone is upset/down, that is HUMAN! With my friend, I feel like this has been 8 years of the same things. \nI\u2019ve tried to help her, I grew up taught to be the way I was before, and no one\u2019s at fault for that. I fear trying to communicate anything wrong in our friendship because she blows up situations so badly it causes me more stress and exhaustion, and that\u2019s my energy I\u2019m trying to protect. \nTo anyone who\u2019s reading this and has had similar friendships, did you have any ideas/conversations that helped? How did that friendship pan out? What helped you the most? \n\nI don\u2019t really want to stop being friends, I am okay with distancing myself a bit, but her anxiety goes into overdrive when that happens. \nThank you (:", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

He said that it started innocent but ended in chilling in a hotel room together and you know what comes next. He didn\u2018t go into further detail but it was pretty obvious what he was on about (she showed my screenshots).\n\nTo be clear, I\u2018m not blaming him for having a weird dream (he probably thought about it before sleeping but he obviously can\u2018t control what he dreams about) but he consciously decided to tell her about it. Did he want something in exchange? Like she replying \u201eok let\u2018s make your dream come true\u201c lmao? I\u2018m trying to understand his intentions. On the other hand, it\u2018s not the first time my ex talked to one of my guys and some bullshit came out in the end, like they complimenting her and she telling me \u201etell your friends not to hit on me\u201c. Sounds childish I know.\n\nHe told my ex not to tell me or his gf about it, so he knew it was a risky topic but my ex ended up telling me because she felt bad for me (at least that\u2018s what she told me\u201c. He also lied to his current gf since she doesn\u2018t have a clue about this incident to this day. \n\nAfter confronting him his initial reaction was \u201edamn, I didn\u2018t know you still talk to your ex\u201c but he quickly realized that he can\u2018t really talk his way out of it. He apologized multiple times but I told him that my decision to end the friendship stands and I don\u2018t wanna talk to him anymore.\n\nToday, a couple months later, I randomly saw him with his gf and I started thinking about the whole situation again. I do miss him as a friend but I\u2018m not sure if I can forgive him. What do you guys think? Does he deserve a second chance?

If you\u2019d like you could go down a couple of posts on my account, the post should have 3 comments.\n\nMe and my friend are really good friends, we met in April on an online game. Everything goes well between us (I think), but something has been bugging me. Her friends can be pretty rude, and can be weird at times. Sometimes it can be understandable, but I don\u2019t know what to do about this one friend.\n\nI really want the best for my friend, and it\u2019s upsetting to hear horrible things he\u2019s said to her. But what he\u2019s about me really hurts me, and I don\u2019t know if my friend wants to defend me, or end the friendship with him. \n\nSomething came up today, we were all playing a game together. Kind of like freeze tag. He was frozen, so was my friend, and I was trying to find him so I could unfreeze him. I ran into my friend, where she was frozen. So I went and unfroze her, he eventually died when I was doing that. He said \u201cSo you save *friends name* and not me\u201d \n\nI thought he thought that I wasn\u2019t trying to save him, so I said in the chat \u201cI was trying to find you but when I started looking she was right near me\u201d \n\nSomething her friends did (including him) made her sort of upset, so she left. I left too. \n\nShe shared messages he just sent to her to me. He said \u201cshe doesn\u2019t understand that was a fucking joke\u201d \u201csmh\u201d \u201csuch a drama queen isstfg\u201d\n\nI told my friend I didn\u2019t know he was joking, and that I was never mad at him, I just wanted him to know I didn\u2019t give up on him. She told me she felt like she was in the middle of this.\n\nShe shared another message he sent about me, it said \u201cwhere I jokingly said \u201cso you got her and not me\u201d it\u2019s a f u c k i n g j o k e e\u201d\nThen she sent another one saying \u201cidefc anymore, so annoying man\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t know what to say, but I wanted her to know how I\u2019ve been feeling. Maybe it was a bad idea, and I\u2019m sorry if it was. Here\u2019s what I sent, it\u2019s pretty long:\n\n\n(Her name), I know you\u2019ve said he\u2019s a good friend to you sometimes, and after all the things he\u2019s said to you, and other people, I didn\u2019t want to give him another chance, but I wanted to because maybe something would happen and I could try to rethink what I thought. What he\u2019s said about me really hurts me, and things he\u2019s said about you and to you really hurts me too. And it hurts me that you let him say things like that to you and others. I know you\u2019re scared of being hurt if you stopped being friends with him, and I\u2019ve been there before too. I don\u2019t like that all the things he\u2019s said and done are just him, it hurts me. I don\u2019t like saying these things because I don\u2019t want it to look like I\u2019m pushing you, or making you seem bad. But it really hurts for you to be friends with him after all of these things, and I understand not wanting to leave a friendship after you\u2019ve made good memories, and being scared you\u2019d miss them, or that you think you made a bad choice. I don\u2019t like having to write this. It\u2019s been really upsetting hearing the things he\u2019s said to you. And the things he\u2019s said about me upsets me too, and I don\u2019t want to brush it off. I know this is pretty long, sorry about that. I know you\u2019ll probably be upset that I\u2019m feeling this way, but I wanted to let you know. This whole situation is hurting me, and I know it\u2019s hurt you too before. I don\u2019t know how to end this message off, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nI\u2019m scared if that was the wrong thing to do, and what she\u2019d say if she responded. All the times I\u2019ve talked about this she\u2019d send \u201c:/\u201c \u201c:|\u201d stuff like that.\n\nI\u2019m really in need of some advice right now, thank you.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I am very lonely. I'm looking for true friends in/around my age bracket.  Older &amp; younger is all right too, but I feel that those closer in age may be more understanding. I was homeless not by choice of my own, from Jun - October 2019. I am currently in a temporary living situation where I will be out on the street in February. This may sound shocking but because there are no resources or assistance, I am coming to terms with my death there. Its hard. I dont want to die on the street. I've never been homeless before. I was fortunate, for lack of a better word to spend most of that time in two homeless shelters. However neither would I wish on my worst enemy. I was not raped but sexually assulted in one of them.  I have termed out &amp; I cant go back to either. I'm in good mental health. I am getting minimal help for \"situational\" anxiety &amp; depression. If I was to attempt suicide, I would receive the maximum care. That's how it works here. I'm in good physical health aside from needing  extensive surgery on my ankle which I have previously postponed. I take no narcotics for either condition. During homelessness, I have been proactive to the best of my ability &amp; resources to better my situation. Because of the area, my age, marital status, no family, no income, resources &amp; help are extremely limited. I am stuck between a rock &amp; a hard place. I take pride in being honest, up front &amp; living an honest life. Being homeless, you learn the hard way who your friends are (if any) &amp; who you can &amp; can't trust. In my prayers each night, I thank the Lord for each day off the street and ask him for friends of the same caliber.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We met in college and were best friends right away, sharing a lot of common interests. Unfortunately the only thing we don\u2019t agree on is how to communicate feelings. Mary\u2019s never been one to tell you what\u2019s bothering her but you know she\u2019s upset right away cause she\u2019s probably giving you the cold shoulder. On the other hand, I like to talk things out and open up, especially if there\u2019s an issue or argument to resolve. \n\nA great example of this took place our second year of college: We were having lunch and talking about life post graduation. On the topic of money and the like, I mentioned off hand that I\u2019m lucky to have supportive parents, emotionally and financially. That while I pave my way in the world, I know they have my back if anything bad happened to me. She thought I meant they were gonna pay for anything and everything I wanted, and that I wasn\u2019t ever going to work hard. But did she ask me to clarify? No, she ignored me for 5 WEEKS because she didn\u2019t like what I said. \nI would come back to my apartment, Mary would be hanging with our mutual friend and my roommate, and Mary would get up and say goodbye to everyone else and walk out the door without even looking at me. She would ignore my texts asking \u201cis anything wrong? Did I do anything to upset you?\u201d\nAll our friends noticed and asked if I knew what was wrong. They didn\u2019t have a clue either, cause she was totally normal with them. I unfairly cornered Mary after class around week 3 and asked what was up. She said \u201cwhat are you talking about? Everything\u2019s fine\u201d and ran out past me to avoid walking back to the dorms together. \nIt wasn\u2019t until a month and a half later, she told me it was that money comment that upset her. Once she did, I realized she misinterpreted and made up her own narrative. I was able explained to her what I meant and she was totally fine after that as if nothing happened, but I\u2019ve never been the same since. \n\nThat\u2019s how she deals with stuff she doesn\u2019t like. This is the best way to describe my entire friendship with Mary. I walk on eggshells when I\u2019m with her, out of fear she\u2019ll flip and get pissed at me. I have an ongoing group text between her, and my partner (were all buds) and we both notice when she isolates something I said and ignores it. She does it to him sometimes too, and it wasn\u2019t until she gave him the cold shoulder for the first time that he believed me when I said she did that. For the most part though, it\u2019s directed at me. Every now and then she\u2019ll isolate something I said and won\u2019t acknowledge it. She\u2019ll hyper fixate on something my partner said however, to drive home the point she\u2019s ignoring my comment. I could get into a bunch of stupid examples about all these different times, but all I can say is I think she has a major problem with me. \n\nRight now we\u2019re planning a trip for New Years while my partner and I are home for the holidays. Mary, my parter and I are all super close and we\u2019ve taken this trip before. We live in another state so this is the only time we get to see her. \n\nI just asked in the group chat if it was okay to invite my sister along. My sister has been on this trip with the 3 of us before and gets along well with everyone. I haven\u2019t invited my sister yet, made that clear in the text, and was just checking how everyone felt. I could tell I upset Mary because she only replied with a curt \u201csure.\u201d  It\u2019s easy to misinterpret over text, but I know her well and my partner even messaged me separately saying \u201cI think you upset Mary\u201d \n\nI messaged Mary separately, explaining myself a little better, and checking if she was really okay with everything. She only replied with \u201cyea\u201d and now I know she\u2019s pissed, with no clue why. I\u2019m expecting her to cancel on the trip, since this has happened before. (Making plans to get together, someone says something she doesn\u2019t like, and she cancels a week or so prior)\n\nTo her benefit she has some pretty bad anxiety, lives at home, and doesn\u2019t get out much. Being with people is pretty overwhelming for her. I\u2019m sure the random addition of my sister has thrown a wrench into her plans, but I can\u2019t understand why. She knows my sister really well and my sister has been on this trip before, so what\u2019s the deal? \nI just want to know if I\u2019m doing anything wrong, or if I\u2019m just crazy. My partner thinks this is all normal, that it\u2019s \u201cpart of the package\u201d when being Mary\u2019s friend. He thinks bending over backwards to keep her happy is the right thing to do. Honestly thought it\u2019s not worth it to me anymore. I am a shell of myself when we chat, she makes me furious thinking about how strongly she reacts and says NOTHING about it even after you beg and plead to make it better. \n\nFor the most part I do love her. She\u2019s funny, smart, talented, and creative. I love talking when we\u2019re together in person (sometimes) and she\u2019s great to bounce ideas and laughs off of. It wasn\u2019t until this year I was ready to let her go. Before now, I was able to forgive everything she did and move on. \n\nHow should I move forward? Should I work harder to empathize and keep my words careful and precise to keep her happy? Or should I be honest with myself and stop trying to be her friend? That last one would be difficult, because she\u2019s close to my partner as well, but I think he\u2019s starting to get annoyed with her too. \n\nJust for the record stuff:\n\n-We both have middle/high class families, no real income difference between us\n\n-Mary, my partner and I all went to art school, we all draw/illustrate. I\u2019ve wondered if there\u2019s some kind of insecurity there but I\u2018m probably assuming too much\n\n-Mary has opened up before about her difficulty communicating. She\u2019s admitted to ignoring people before because she doesn\u2019t like/know how to resolve conflict \n\n-She\u2019s recognized her fault in ignoring me that once time and has apologized\n\n-Yes, she\u2019s done the same thing to me multiple times to me since but that\u2019s the longest cold shoulder I got from her\n\n\nTLDR: it\u2019s really hard work being a friend with someone close to my life. They overreact and handle communicating poorly (in my opinion). Is it worth it being friends anymore and how to I more forward?\n\nEdited paragraphs and spacing", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

He would take me and show me all details about his projects, and sometimes tell me how much he would like to have someone to share them (humans are so melancholic). It's quite impressive, i have to say. So if you interested on that, you might like what he does.\n* **Art:** He is a pretty creative person, when not 24 hours on front of that screen, he will take a book and start making lines, even if it is 3 am.

In 17 years I have not been able to shower consistently or control my impulses. In 17 years I haven\u2019t been able to achieve anything I\u2019ve wanted to do, and in conclusion, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a promising sign about how the rest of my adulthood will be.\u201d \n\nI am a very dysfunctional person, and I I don\u2019t express these feelings to anyone outside of my family, because my flaws aren\u2019t evident. I seem pretty successful on the surface. \n\nI came to the US in mid 2017. My English is void of any accent, I\u2019ve acclimated pretty well to this country. I\u2019ve got good social skills but I cannot keep many friends, I was the one who was seen as the smartest in the class in high-school, I\u2019ve finished one semester of college (which I\u2019ve failed two classes, because guess what? I had to pay attention and work on a long term goal for the first time.) \n\nI\u2019ve had teachers give me letters at the end of a semester saying that they can\u2019t wait to see me get published one day (until I came to one of them this year after a drug induced psychosis, and I could see the disappointment in his face, it was heartbreaking but at that moment I did not give a fuck.) \n\nI\u2019ve been hired on the spot because I impressed the manager so much (until I got fired, then rehired, and then fired again by the same manager in a five month span for my repeated transgressions and mistakes) \n\nI\u2019ve been accepted and given a comic book scholarship (which I never finished and completely failed at) and I\u2019ve been given a two year free tuition scholarship to my local community college (which I might lose soon because of how badly I performed this past semester) \n\nI\u2019m all talk, if anyone dug deeper they\u2019d discover that I cannot control anything about myself. It\u2019s a never ending battle to not be an extremist. I either sleep too much or stay for hours and hours on an end without sleep, I binge eat, I get obsessive about my looks and spend 300 dollars on makeup and then go for weeks without showering, I go from being very social to isolating myself socially and feeling disgusted with social interaction. I go from being very religious to believing I\u2019m an atheist. In essence I cannot trust myself and I do not think I\u2019ll be leaving my parents\u2019 basement anytime soon, but no one (except for them) understands that. They\u2019ve been aware of it for as long as I\u2019ve been with them.  Without revealing more personal information about myself (Tune in and message me for a very incriminating life story) they do not come from a background that tolerates my impulsivity and behavioral issues, when we lived in Saudi Arabia, my behavioral issues went undiagnosed for a long time. They\u2019ve put me in therapy for being (\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- another thing you\u2019ll need to tune in for\u2014\u2014\u2014-) at the age of 13, and recently I\u2019ve finally agreed to test for adhd (after me denying it for years and self medicating with other things instead) and I\u2019ve been diagnosed with adhd, turns out I have very bad executive function and that I\u2019m on the low end of the spectrum of intelligence. I do not hate that, but I just don\u2019t know what to do with that information). \n\nMy parents are wonderful human beings, they\u2019ve given me chance after chance to redeem myself. The other day they found out I gave lsd to my 15 year old brother (the second time I\u2019ve done that and promised not to do it, they hated me and called me a devil the first time) they were very nice to me this time, just forgave me. I thought it would be the final line for them, the line that ends it all. I told them that I always thought our relationship would crumble sooner or later and that I would go out and destroy myself, I asked them why they were so merciful with me. They told me that it was because I was their daughter and they loved me, and that absolutely destroyed me. I wish I could go back in time and not be so impulsive, I wish I could live again without reducing myself to what I am today. It\u2019s too early for me to have so many regrets but I\u2019ve fucked it all up from the moment I breathed my first breath. They don\u2019t deserve what I do to them, and yet I don\u2019t know how to resist all these temptations, I don\u2019t know how to not be a slob. \n\nWhat frustrates me the most is the amount of patience and time poured into me and opportunity given to me, my parents have 12 kids they need to take care of, yet I give them the most trouble. Theoretically I should be able to succeed and soar, however, I end up failing repeatedly and struggling with the most simple everyday tasks. \n\nI suppose I just want some comforting words  or tragic realities, I want you to tell me about how it all worked out (or didn\u2019t) for you.

My friend of 10 years and I made plans last week to go out Saturday night. The day of, I texted her asking if she\u2019s still down. She replied in short \u201ctoo cool for you\u201d type of texts, followed by saying this guy might come over (heart eye emojis). This guy blows her off all the time and she knows I\u2019m not a huge fan of him so I just said that\u2019s lame, and she should blow him off like he always does. She said I was right, asked what bars we should go to and if I was ready. I told her I was almost ready and we should go to ____ bar, then she said her other friend just called her and needs her to help her move... at 10 pm Saturday night. So I just said mmmkay bye. This is probably silly and I\u2019m overthinking it but we haven\u2019t talked since. I\u2019m upset because she was going to blow me off to hang with a pretty lame guy and then seemingly made up a lie to not go last minute. I wish she would have just said she didn\u2019t feel like going out from the get go. For some reason I feel like the bad guy. I want peace with this friend but idk how to go about it. I also don\u2019t want to accuse her of lying but I highly doubt someone would call her up to ask her for moving help at that time, and also bugged that she\u2019d say yes to that if so. Please help, need other perspectives. Thanks!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I expected this to just go ignored and move on with my life but i've actually received a lot of messages and am totally overwhelmed with the response so far. If you've messaged me at all know this: I am eternally grateful for that. It's 7 AM here currently and i was awake all night crying because i felt so miserable. Now i'm here crying because i'm genuinely touched by the response to this post. If you've messaged me at all please know i will message you back, i might need a bit more time to cry myself out and process what just happened but i will message every single person back, i promise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis sub has been getting recommended to me recently so i guess why not try it.\n\nI'm Jacky, 22, female and born/currently living in Germany. German is my first language but i greatly prefer speaking English. I'm LGBT+ friendly and consider myself agender (i do go with she/her pronouns for ease, though) and bisexual.\n\nI'm a bit of a troubled person and struggle a lot with my mental health. My life so far has been quite traumatic and so i've developed several mental and physical illnesses. I still live in a very abusive household which makes it hard to get my health under control. I've been labled too sick to work and therefore stay at home most of the day and don't get to talk or spend time with people a lot. Growing up with an abusive family i never developed a good relationship to them so even now i'm not able to bond with them. As a kid i got bullied in school, the trauma left me being the \"weird\" and sad kid and i never fit in. I've basically struggled making friends all my life, the only person that's been consistently in my life is my partner and even that situation has now become troublesome after 5 years.\n\nI hang out and play video games with people whenever they let me join them, but i constantly feel like the odd one out. I'm always just the friend of a friend of a friend and not really part of the \"group\". For the past year i've been spending more and more time just by myself and i'm getting progressively more lonely and miserable. Most of the day i have no one to talk to, no one to check up on and no one who will check up on me. I can't remember the last time someone hit me up and asked me how my day was.\n\nI'm honestly not very interesting, i don't do a lot of things and i talk a lot and have a hard time getting to the point (as one can see). I'm boring, my humor is shitty but i'm honestly just trying to have a good time and make some good memories with someone. I'm not looking for someone to talk to about my problems and i don't just want to become a sponge for someone else's sadness. I just want someone to hang out with, i guess.\n\nAs said above i mostly just play games and would love to find someone willing to come join me. Currently i mostly play Warframe and League HOWEVER i am absolutely awful at League. Quite possibly the worst player you will ever meet but i just enjoy the game and wish i had someone to play with that wouldn't just get mad at me. I also really enjoy playing Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Risk of Rain 2, Path of Exile, Overwatch, Black Desert Online and even silly games like One Hour One Life. As you can see i'm desperate as fuck so someone please have mercy.\n\nI did stream on twitch for a while but most days i can't find the motivation. I feel like i don't deserve anyones time and so it's hard to... get going i guess.\n\nI am also an artist (wow!) but i don't draw much anymore.\n\nI don't really watch anime or any shows in general but i'm not that opposed to it. I just don't enjoy watching shows/movies by myself so i stopped getting into \"fandoms\" and such but if someone wants to just hang out and watch the Witcher series on Netflix with me i'm not gonna say no to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdk what else to say really, i saw some posts on here but was too shy and scared to reply to them so i figured i'd just try making my own. I'm a bit careful considering the hurt i've been through so i'd probably prefer just chatting on here for a bit and then adding each other on Discord (i don't really use anything else, I have some social media like twitter i guess) so please don't be offended if it takes me a bit to get comfortable.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

{"post_id": "eefroj", "created_utc": 1577076620, "title": "scapegoated??", "author": "EchoAuditore", "self_text": "Hi, this is a first post in this particular subreddit.\n\nTL;DR of this thread: Has anyone ever been used as a scapegoat because of previous mistakes and wrongdoings that you actually admit and own up to? Simply because you did it once in the past, people say your name but they are the ones in the wrong?\nAnd how can one address this? It\u2019s very hurtful and it invalidates my progress, while hiding the fact that someone else is actually toxic and unwell.\n\n\n\nOk, so the details below.\n\nI am a survivor of abuse in the past, in which I have had abandonment issues, anxiety, and many other things. In the past year I was diagnosed with Bi Polar, but more on that relevance later.\n\nDue to my doormat-like nature and doinng whatever it took to not be alone, I went through a lot of counselling when that got out of hand and i was being used for people\u2019s gains for all sorts of reasons. Using my talent, my connections, etc. This was very damaging and after a lot of many bad relationships and my coming-to later, one particularly bad ex was the tipping point which drove me to try and get help. \n\nFortunately, therapy and counselling and a lot of self assessing later I have become stronger willed and wont hesitate to call people out on bullshit. Sometimes I feel its a bit too much sometimes, I can (and will) cut people off and distance if I feel they are a negativity that will hurt me.\n\nBut I\u2019m still a work in progress. I still make mistakes here and there and make arguments, am stubborn, other things that make me very hardheaded and NOT back down because I\u2019ve learned to not be walked on.\n\nCut forward to a year ago, I was causing issues REPEATEDLY with close friends, to which I actually took a step back and noticed that I was at risk of losing the few people I had left. I saw this pattern and noticed \u201chey this isnt right why am I doing this\u201d, then actively sought help, and ended up being diagnosed with Bi Polar. It made sense with my terrible sleep durations, emotional swings and how easily I could take offense from things which came from close friends.\n\nI own up to everything I did wrong, I KNOW I fucked up and all I could do was to learn from mistakes, watch my mouth, continue therapy and continue to keep diaries and monitor my moods and sleep patterns.\n\nNow despite all this, I seem to be easily used as the scapegoat whenever some drama goes down in a friend group and I\u2019m involved. I find it HIGHLY UNFAIR but because I was difficult in the past, my name is mentioned and it\u2019s quickly decided \u201coh they did it again, typical.\u201d\n\nIts very hurtful as I have learned many self assessing and reflecting scenarios, taking notes and journals, etc. Stuff I\u2019ve seen makes me think that other friends I have are actually quite selfserving and toxic, but it isnt my place to judge when they \u201chavent done wrong\u201d.\n\nHas anyone ever experienced such a thing? and how did you deal with it?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "eefyvo", "created_utc": 1577077759, "title": "21M - Seeking genuine, stimulating conversation to turn into a friendship.", "author": "MustUnderstandAll", "self_text": "I'm tired of the same old simple friendships where things stagnate. The general trend of just being friendly and the occasional facade of care for each other. Where you only shoot the shit every once in a while. Where there's no growth, no true desire to connect, and no stimulation. Where people are waiting to have their turn to talk instead of listening. Where there's just no investment. While I do understand there is merit to some of these things in some contexts - it's just not what I\u2019m looking for. I am of the belief now that no matter how friendly or nice a person is, it's just a waste of time if there\u2019s no deeper, genuine connection. I desire collaboration. A connection where we flow when we talk together, where we have things for the other to think about and we listen attentively. Genuine care and empathy for each other. Where we improve each other entirely securely as equals, emotionally intelligently and maturely. Usually, I have had more success with females due to my very open self and talking about my emotions sensitively, but I don't know why this so associated with only femininity, seems pretty silly to me. It's very important to me to be emotionally open and secure with another who you can call a really good friend, regardless of gender. I have a lot of opinions on society extrapolating from these such kinds of shortcomings that I could talk about at much length.\n\nAnd I hope I'm not coming off too super serious right now lol, I can be funny, wholesome, sarcastic and play around and all that, it's just that there needs to be something more also happening regularly, and I've come to find after a lot of getting to know a lot of different types of people that the basis is a certain desire for improvement of oneself, progression, and creativity (and not just the art kind, but specifically in general thought) and willing to share it passionately together. Optimization of one another. It sounds almost robotic when I put it that way, but the word works pretty well lol, I could spend hours just talking about life, about people, about patterns, about the \"reading between the lines\" except of all parts of life, and ways to improve upon them and to dig deeper. Show me your creativity, your deepest, most passionate and most controversial ideas, show me how, why, and what you think! And I will do the same, and we will discuss! It's so very fulfilling to me, let's improve each other, let's share our ideas, let's relish in that ultimate, close depth!\n\nSo a bit more about me - I'm apolitical, I don't really like the whole tribalism stuff and how easily people can get attached to ideologies, but in general it seems I would lean closer to the left. Really though, not a fan of super strong political convictions that make people emotionally attached to an unhealthy degree; my goal when talking with one another is to help each other grow, to discuss, not to debate - it's never a competition to me, it's a genuine, wholesome desire to look out for each other and be there for one another. I'm a fan of math and philosophy and what can be gained from both - a deep understanding of reality on an abstract and conceptual level. I love following my own creative attempts at applying knowledge and understandings of life as a whole to improve upon them. I don't have a plan for life yet beyond doing an undergrad in math - so many potentially fulfilling options, I'm excited, but still unsure. I'm pretty kept up on tons of news, topics, and things on reddit at least, I have quite the expansive exposure to internet over the years, and I absolutely incessantly think about literally everything so I don't believe it'd be all that tough to find something in common to talk about. Really, the material topic of interests is of much less importance to me as compared to what's really going into the formulation of them and how they work. For some actual material examples though, discussing documentaries/books/(conspiracy)theories/gaming/anime/myself/yourself/life/opinions/etc are some off the top of my head. I'm also quite scientifically oriented in general thought, so if I inquire something about you, it's because I wholesomely want to understand something better about you, however, as communication is key, I will pay heed to boundaries. Personally, I am an open book.\n\nSo I think I've rambled enough for an introduction lol, even though I could keep going for quite a while. I know what I'm asking for here is pretty intimate and likely a lot to ask for right out the gate, so I'm entirely understanding of progression and starting somewhere simpler as well. Ultimately, I'm interested in anyone who likes what I'm talking about here. With that, if I sound cool, hit me with a pm about yourself or something you vibed with from my post here, I'd love to talk about it on discord!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

A few days ago I went to a movie with them, visited with them for a while, then went to their house and hung out for a bit, then they initiated sex which I was fine with. Claimed they didn\u2019t plan it and didn\u2019t want me to think they had an agenda. We planned on going to a movie together yesterday. They mentioned they might have to stay late for work. If so, they\u2019d give me their spot, if not they\u2019d message me and meet me. \n\nI went to the theater after work and decided to go next door for food to wait to hear back from them. I waited around to hear from them and after like 20 minutes they asked me if I still wanted to go. I said yes, because I had told them I wanted to go a few times and had shown up at the theater to wait for them. Didn\u2019t hear from them for a bit so I shot them a text checking in with them to see if they had to work. I finally heard from them saying they were at the theater. So I said \u201cok, I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d It was about a minute walk. Then they texted me saying \u201cI didn\u2019t realize my friend was going until just now. They saved me a seat but there\u2019s other spots.\u201d\n\n.....\n\nNaturally it hurt my feelings so I just went to the movie but was just too bothered and didn\u2019t spend any money so I just got up and walked out. \n\nLater that night, right about the time the movie was supposed to be over they text me asking if I got to the movie (?????????) I told them yeah, right after you got there, I sat in the back. They asked me if I liked the movie and if I stayed for the q&amp;a afterwards. I told them no, I left. They kept trying to make small talk about the movie and I just ignored their last text.\n\nI might see them on Saturday and if so I was planning on telling them like \u201cyou know, that kind of sucked to invite me and then send me to go sit by myself. I would have just gone to a movie by myself. I\u2019m just trying to make friends and if you don\u2019t want to hang out with me anymore that\u2019s fine. Keep your +1 for people you want to hang out with.\u201d\n\nAs usual I\u2019m worried I have the wrong idea but I know I don\u2019t and that they didn\u2019t actually want to hang out with me and found a way out. \n\nI also figured they\u2019d probably avoid me come Saturday and subsequent days I work at their shop so on Saturday before my shift I was gonna shoot them a text saying like \u201chey, if you\u2019re not pressed I\u2019d like a minute of your time.\u201d And hope they\u2019re not too chicken shit to follow through. \n\nI thought they liked me enough.

I hid the demons for long enough that they grew from pocket-sized embers to the forest fire that sweeps through nations, it grew as it ate my soul bit by bit leaving moresels behind so knew what I used to have. They say everyone can be fixed but hey never talk about where there was someone left inside the shell of the human they were trying to help. My friends who read it this far, I cannot keep going like this so someone please, keep me from myself for atleast one night.

So like the true idiot I am, I've been holding off Christmas shopping and thinking about it until the very last day. And unlike a true idiot, I'm asking you guys for help and inspiration. So there are the follow targets.\n\nMy 6 yo sister. Very cute and playful but kinda stubborn. While she does like to draw and color, she's more of a storyteller. Loves to play with dolls and plushies and make characters and stuff. My dad gave her some Lego Friends which I do think is cool because building is good for the brain and allows her to play out her fantasies. \n\nMy 13 yo sister. Typical Moody and too cool for big bro teen. My dad is giving her money now so she can go out and do stuff with friends which I think is cool. Was thinking of getting her a cinema gift card or maybe cash. But I would want to give something small and pretty to go along with it. \n\nThere's my step mom who's really into her beauty and stuff. But in such a weird and extreme way that I feel unqualified to buy something which she would find useful.\n\nThen there is my newly born niece, 2 months of age. I already got her a cuddle blanket that crackles but would like to buy something else but not quite sure what because she's obviously already being showered in gifts.\n\nAnd lasts for her mom. While I know that if you buy something for the baby you also buy it for the mom, but I would like something for her specifically. But because her whole world revolves around the baby now I can't buy her the gifts anymore that I used to.\n\nIf you're still here, thanks so very much.

My last few days were really boring and also kinda lonely, because most  of my friends were either busy doing something or live really far away,  so that time zones are messed up. So I thought why not give this a try,  maybe someone out there has some common interests and wants to chat and  become friends eventually :D\n\nSo a little bit about me, because shared interests are usually a good starting point for a good, and not dry, conversation:\n\n\\-Video  Games: I really enjoy playing video games with friends. Mostly the coop  adventure type, like Astroneer or Minecraft, so it would be really fun  to play something like that with you. Also I would be willing to buy new  games to play them if they look cool and if you want to play them  together :)\n\n\\-Technology: I'm huge  technology nerd and so it would be cool to have someone to talk about  linux-y or just general computer stuff with. (If you get my username  then that's already a huge plus and you're obligated to message me ;p)  But don't worry, because even tho I could talk about that pretty much  all day, I know when to shut up to not annoy anyone :P\n\n\\-YouTube,  Movies, Music: Like most people on this planet I like to listen to  music (nothing fancy, mostly pop and your usual radio music. My favorite  band is SDP at the moment). And I also spend waaay too much time  watching YouTube, mostly comedy and infotainment stuff like Half As  Interesting or good old Vsauce ;D\n\n\\-Anime:  Yeah I was a huge weeb about two years ago, I'll admit it and I still  watch the occasional show. Lately I really enjoyed Shield Hero and can't  wait for the second season. So yeah it would be cool to talk about that  or maybe watch it together, if you haven't seen the show? I really  enjoy watching stuff together anyway, it doesn't have to be Anime :)\n\n\\-There  is much more, but that should give you a idea of what kind of person I  am I think? But now I want to hear about your interests, because that's  much more interesting anyway and I am pretty much open to talk about  anything really, so I'll try my best to keep the conversation  interesting and not like *\"Hi, how are you\", \"good, wby?\", \"i'm fine, thanks\", \"cool\"*, because yeah, that's lame :p\n\nThat's  basically it and if it sounded somehow interesting to you, then I'd  really like to get a DM from you and see if we click. I won't ghost,  because I got ghosted too many times in the past and know that it really  sucks, so dw about that. Oh and I'm from Central Europe, so if you're  too that would be a huge plus because y'know, time zones..\n\nAnyway have a great evening/day/night/whatever everyone :DD", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We hit it on as friends really quickly, we were so alike. I felt as if i met the other part of my soul i never knew existed. We called each other separated twins. I have some connection issues with people, and i have hard time admitting to someone i really love them and care about them, but i had zero problems with that with her. I loved her with all depths of my soul, and if she asked me to do the craziest thing for her, i probably would. \n\nAround six months into our friendship, i had a very big fight with one of my classmates, and i can literally say she ruined my life, she spread rumours about me, turned all of other classmates against me, and landed me into therapy eventually. I didnt tell anyone about therapy, and only my parents knew about it. But Jane and all of my other friends knew how much that fight affected me. \n\nFew months later Jane tells me she saw the person that landed me into therapy, and that she really wants to go out with her. I felt crushed, and also i got so angry, i said a lot of mean things to Jane, i felt as if she ripped my soul apart, but also i felt like that person is getting closer to me once again, through people that i love and that scared me.  She apologized and said that she was wrong, and then said we will talk after the situation calmed down. \n\nMeanwhile, after that fight, she went to her other best friend, a male, let's call him Mark. Mark and Jane have a very weird friendship, they both have jealous outbursts and they hate other friends that each person has. So as you can guess, Mark hated the living fuck out of me. Even tho he claimed he didn't, but he was very passive agressive towards Jane when she would talk about me. So after our conflict, Jane went to Mark, and i feel like he manipulated her into ditching me out of her life. When we discussed everything later, i apologized 100 times, and told her the whole story about why i feel so uncomfortable about the person that i had fight with. He told her that he thinks we got close way too qucikly and that he thinks we are just not right for each other. She believed him. \n\nShe said we were okay, but she banned me from expressing my feelings to her, became very cold, and started avoiding me. \n\nI asked her what was wrong around a month later, and she says that everything for me died inside her that day, and she doesn't want to do anything with me, and that she kept limited contact jsut so she wouldn't hurt me. Also said that she wants to remain friends but doesn't want  to be close. It's been weeks now, and i haven't heard from her ever since.\n\nI'm hurt, confused and i really don't know what to do \n\nJust a a few days before she told me that everything for me died in her,i helped her organize a birthday gift for Mark, i discussed her birthday gift with her, and she tried to guess what it is. We talked about future. We were buying same sunglasses so we could be twins. We were talking about meeting ( we go to different universities). And then she says everything died right after our conflict. How? you don't do things like that with people you have zero feelings for. \n\nMaybe i'm just reaching, but i feel like Mark manipulated and influenced her when she was vulnerable, and now she shut me out of her life, after first conflict, first disagreement even. \n\nI don't know what to do guys, i'm suffering, i've been sad for weeks now, but she seems like she doesn't care, or at least she acts very good.\n\nI need some advices on how to deal with this situation.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Everyone enjoying the holidays and being so happy. Having the wonder of a gift someone who cares about them got them. I never feel that joy.

Finding all the right time to meet both sets of family for Christmas. Just enjoying that gift that only a woman can give. The closeness of being cared about. It's all I've ever wanted and Christmas makes that feeling into a depressing time. I don't want stuff, I want to be loved. Even in the past when I was in a relationship, it never happened. We were always somewhere else doing something else. Maybe we would see each other a few weeks before Christmas but I never got to spend the time the right way. I'm 32 now. Alone. Sad. Sitting in my apartment cursing the season for joy I'll never have because I can't find a woman. Is it always going to be like this?\n\nI need a friend to tell me if this is how it's always going to be. Is this what my life will amount to?

I'm sure you know why CPS was involved.Was homeless twice  for about 3 weeks long each time I was homeless. Found a place back in  March and i've been staying there since then. This new room mate who was  our really old co worker ran away from home and claims her parents  abuse her. She has taken my room and I lived in the living room for a  while. She has gotten physical with me before and drunk multiple  occasions while begging me to make out with her. Keep in mind i'm also a  gay male and she crosses boundaries and asks me if I find her  attractive which I clearly don't and she gets upset over this and falls  into a deep rabbit hole of self hate. More I got to know her the more I  realized they didn't abuse her and she had left over selfish reasons.  After she has moved out she visits them and spends the night at their  place if things go south for her while having one night stands with guys  off of tindr. Some guys have become stalkers and followed her to work  and ofc they know our address as well and stalked this area out as well.  She relies on her parents for comfort and financially as well since she  comes from a rich background. Her parents invite her over for dinner  and she sleeps there since she feels safer there. Only reason why she  moved out is because she wants to be able to stay out late past 10pm and  come home at lets say 4 or even 10 in the morning the next day while  enjoying herself with dates. She has been freeloading here since August.  I stopped paying rent as well. My older room mate allows her to live  her rent free and doesn't request money from me either since other room  mate also has parents she relies on financially to pay some of her  bills.\n\nWe had recently gotten into  a fight after our newmate kicked my cat out because her cat doesn't  like my cat. Her cat is sick and vomits everywhere while my cat is more  playful and energetic and wants to socialize with other pets. After that  incident she has gotten more physical and verbal. I refused to pay for  half the stuff she has bought for the house. After she had moved in I  had paid 450 dollars before in the span of one week and that went  towards stuff we needed for the house. I never asked anyone to help  cover the cost of expenses since I stopped paying rent and it's the  least I could do to contribute to the house. After that, she refuses to  allow me to use toilet paper or even the TV in the living room which her  parents own. I asked her not to use my gaming computer since it's worth  1.2k dollars and holds a lot of emotional value to me. She has then  gotten more physical and verbal towards me. I paid for the gaming  computer and she doesn't understand how much it's worth to me on a  different value than money. Ofc money also means a lot to me since I  don't have parents to rely on either. She hasn't spent more than 500  dollars on anything in her life. her car, gaming laptop, and 1k usd TV  have all been paid by her parents yet she is onto me for not paying for  stuff she has bought on her own will for the house and is onto me for  sleeping in the living room while she and other room mate get drunk and  trash the whole living room. Not to mention it stays that way for an  entire week.\n\nShe keeps berating me  and insulting me for being raised in an abusive household and for being  raised differently and holding onto insecurities that weird habbits  that have been carried over to my adulthood. For the most part, I'm a  peaceful guy, I want to stay out of trouble so I tend to ignore her or  give her small responses and try not to lash out on her. She and other  room mate truly believe that all men are trash and have a hatred towards  men and follow along by what society perceives as toxic masculinity yet  at the same time they do believe that i'm seen as different than other  men or weaker than other men since I am gay and that allows them to  belittle me and get physical with me.\n\nI hate being in another abusive household after getting away from my parents.

Earlier this evening when I visited, he was having some dispute with his mother over something silly. I then heard him say to her, \"I will kick you in the shins so hard that I will damage you.\" Something happened and then a few minutes later I heard her telling him to get off her, that this behaviour was unacceptable and that he cannot act this way and expect nice things from her.\n\nThis is not the first time this has happened. A few weeks ago I was at their house and he lost his marbles over something else. He had asked for something and she had told him no, not right now. It wasn't the answer he wanted to hear so again, he started kicking off, yelling and screaming. He started throwing his fists around. He has bad coordination and mostly he was just punching the air, but a few times he connected with her back or the side of her body.   It's not the point though, that he's a bad aim. The point is, you don't start getting slap happy when things don't go your way.\n\nWe were at the cinema once, waiting in line. Again, he asked for something and M told him that we had enough food. His response was, \"I will punch you in the face.\" An old lady standing behind us gasped and tutted. He heard, turned around and poked the tongue at her.\n\nSoon he will be bigger and stronger than her, as he is built like his father. (His father is 6'3 and a large, wide man. He is big) One of these days he could potentially do real damage to her. She can fight him off, for now, but one day she won't be able to. I have spoken to her often when she has asked for advice about his behaviour. When he acts this way, there are no consequences or negative repercussions. He doesn't lose screen time, for example, his bedtime doesn't get shifted earlier, he's still allowed treats after dinner. I have told her she needs to be harder on him and make sure that he knows he cannot treat people this way, but she is always reluctant. She can't ground him, as he has no friends, he never gets invited anywhere, he doesn't go to friend's houses or have friend's over. He treats people shitty.\n\nM told me once that this is how her ex used to treat her. He would bully her until he got what he wanted. I told her it was too late for him, but there was still time to try and teach her son that you cannot go through life treating people this way, or having a meltdown when things don't go your way. Life isn't fair, shit happens.\n\nI value her as a friend, but his behaviour makes it hard to be a friend, as I can't believe the way he speaks to her. He has no respect and he treats her like rubbish. He doesn't seem to care if other people are around and he kicks off. He doesn't seem embarrassed when other friends of hers tell him off or tell him to stop.\n\nI like her, we're good friends, but as long as he is around with his rudeness, arrogance and bad attitude, I don't see much of a future to our friendship. I feel sorry for her, having to live with someone like that, knowing that her son is \"that kid\"  \n\n\nYou hear of children cutting their parents off because of shitty and abusive situations, but I feel like she may be the one cut her son off when he's older if he doesn't change. She's said as much to me too.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She then proceeded to make him unfollow me. A few minutes later, common acquaintance/friend C also \"unfollowed\" me. I understood very quickly that she was behind both actions as those two poeple never do these kind of unexpected things on SNS without at least talking to me if there is an issue. \nSo I went straight to another SNS and told B and C, that I noticed  they unfollowed me and that I think they might have been unaware of it, seeing she might be behind this. They both told me they were unaware of it. Friend B said he thinks she took his phone behind his back and assured me he'll follow me back, and with friend C, we had a long convo, where she apologized to me because she thought that I fought with toxic friend A because of her. And I clarified as best as I could and said that it had nothing to do with her and that I still cared for her.\n\nAll of them live in another country, I left that country a year ago with a lot of unsaid things. I knew friend A would do a lot behind my back to try and make me isolated in case I come back and still wanna be close to the poeple we have in common. I still care for 3 poeple who are close to her. I don't know if I want to see them again, even though I kept in touch with two of them. I will come back in that country in a couple of months.\n\nIn your opinion, did I react well or did I seem insecure about A's manipulation ? It still kind of gets me. I still don't know what I want to do with these friendships. Should I forget it all ? But I don't want A to decide for me or for them. The three of them have been nice to me on several occasions and I enjoyed their company. Even if we might never be close again, I am reluctant to cut them off, esp since I know the biggest reason would be the manipulations of A.\n\nWhat do you think ?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019m currently having a problem and I hope someone could help me. I don\u2019t mean to sound proud by saying this, but I have a lot of friends. I thought it would be easy to sustain the friendship with these people individually, but apparently not. I have noticed that I have not seen some of these friends for weeks or even months. This has resulted in one of them to voice out how upset they were for me not having time to spend with them and when I do, I spend it with someone else that I\u2019m haven\u2019t seen in a Long time as well. I\u2019ve always mentioned how busy I am and how my family wants me to spend time with them more since it\u2019s the holidays, but it seems like that reason doesn\u2019t seem to satisfy them anymore. It has come to my attention that maybe I\u2019m not cut out for maintaining a lot of relationships with people due to my shitty time management &amp; anxiety of seeing people in general. I thought that the solution may be to cut off some ties with people that I drifted away from and maintain the friendship with those that I\u2019m in touch with now. However, i don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea considering that I\u2019ve already started a friendship with these people and ending it off simply just because I can\u2019t do it anymore. Does anyone have any suggestions ? I would really appreciate them. \n\nTLDR: I suck at sustaining a lot of friendships because of anxiety of seeing people &amp; bad time management.

We're both studying premed at college; while it is immensely difficult, I'm not very vocal about my struggles but this person is always complaining and crying about how much they're struggling even though they're doing better than me. They constantly break down and cry about their problems and keep getting sympathy from the rest of our friend group which is irritating because I'm in the same field and don't get half the support. It's annoying to hear her constantly getting validation from our friends. This person lies about their grades to acquaintances for compliments and posts their test grades on social media for attention. I don't intend on raining on their parade but I don't know how to deal with someone who is so desperate for people's attention and validation all the time. This person knew that I'd been struggling in a class (C- average) and cried to me about their B in the same class, not bothering to take into account how I feel. Apart from this  tendency to be self-centered, they're a good friend. The only thing is, they'd like to room with me and one of our other friends next year and I don't know how I'm going to put up with their constant need for validation and complaining next year especially since we will be in the same living space. I'm fine with giving people advice but I can't be their therapist, constantly telling them that everything is going to be alright when I'm struggling myself.

I want to talk about something that I think isn't exclusive to me and that's holiday blues. \n\nTo make a long story short my life isn't where I want it to be, it's been pretty rotten lately, and at the beginning of November I was having suicidal thoughts. I went to a mental hospital, got some help, and I'm working on getting better. But, the holidays have sucked. I came home for Thanksgiving to visit my mom. It wasn't a good time, we fought, and she was not supportive or understanding of how I was behaving (depressed, quiet, not very sociable or happy). \n\nI thought Christmas would be different, and better with my sister here. I flew home again, and after a nightmare of delays I had a nice night last night. But since then, today I feel ganged up on. Now my sister thinks I'm being an ass because I'm having mood swings, my mom does as well. I'm still lethargic, sad and generally I feel unwanted. If I can't be a happy person then they don't want to be around me, or want me to be around them or their friends because I'm not keeping up appearances. \n\nI feel trapped. I feel alone. And I feel like I'm not worth much to anyone. \n\nI don't feel suicidal. So please don't be worried about that. I just really need someone to talk to about the things in my life that make me want to pull out what's left of my hair and cry and scream. \n\nI also want to help people who feel like they're in similar situations and their holidays aren't going too well.

Half a year ago I stopped talking to my best online friend. I had stopped talking to him once before for about a month. He was just being really possessive and even said stuff like he would kill himself if I didn't answer right away. He always looked if I was online anywhere (I know this because he told me). During that first \"split\" I worked with some of his real life friends to get him some help. He was diagnosed as being depressed and having a borderline personality disorder.After that I started to contact him again. For about 3 Months he was kinda normal again. But it didn't last long, soon he started to say that he just said everything bad he did was because of that so it wasn't his fault. He also began doing drugs like mdma because \"he couldn't help it\". And also he started to be possessive again. I couldn't do anything online. Not even look at my Instagram without him seeing I had my phone in my hands. He soon started to call me every hour \"just to check if I was ok\" .  At one point I just couldn't take it anymore and tried talking everything through again. This made him really angry again and he said some really not so nice things to me and himself. He just as before said it was just because I didn't under stand his bpd etc... I'm myself fighting with depression and all this just made me break down. I spent some time in the hospital (psych ward) after this. After this I was told he did this to another girl before but not in this scale. He also started to ignore all his real life friends that I knew online. I even stopped doing stuff with them in hopes he would do stuff with them again. I really tried to help and be a good friend. I know I probably wronged and hurt him too. And I just feel like I made everything worse and am a massive idiot. I just don't know if at an point I should try to contact him again? I really miss him but I don't really know how he is doing and I don't want to stress him or make him angry again just by contacting him. Would it be better for him to never hear from me again?

Some context, we got to know each other because we were in the same class and we then joined the same co-curricular activity. Recently, I got pissed because I thought she was not attending training because she was hanging out with her friends. (I should have known better) but the reason I was really angry was because she always had other commitments and never attended training and when she did she was always a nuisance so basically I really despised her as a teammate. To make matters worse, my coach always talked about how poor her attitude was and how he wanted to kick her out of the team but he never did and well, that really made me salty. OK so then I thought she was really going to skip training so I was impulsive and sent a message about how irresponsible I thought she was, oops, but in the end it turned out that it was all a prank and yea beef broke out. Ok I think that this was a really petty issue and she said she didn\u2019t get why I was angry since she turned up anyway but the thing is I feel like this anger has been built up. she has been skipping training since the start and she didn\u2019t really feel remorseful because well she felt like her other commitments were more valid than others\u2019 reasons for not coming for training. This first reason really made me hate her JUST AS A TEAMMATE. So today\u2019s Christmas and she said \u201cmerry Xmas stop being angry in 2020\u201d yea i feel really bad and I\u2019m kinda unsure of what to do about the friendship because she hasn\u2019t been a good Friend to me for the past 4 years. We had a very on and off friendship and it was mostly because she got angry with me ( she never really told me why) but I always apologised because I treasured our friendship. However, this year she told me she started to cherish me more, but the thing is this year I decided that I didn\u2019t want to cherish her as much as I did in the past because it really hurt me when she got angry and ignored me without telling me why???? In my opinion, she\u2019s not a very nice person and many people are afraid of her so they remain friends with her. She makes friends with many people but after a while she gets sick of them and drop them. She has also PMS at others many times but people just let her off because 1. They\u2019re afraid of her and 2. People accept it and say \u201cshe\u2019s like that\u201d wel, I don\u2019t believe that someone could be naturally so bad natured so I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s a good excuse? And people are afraid of her because when she hates you she can influence others to be on her side as well. So what do you think I should do??", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I recently received a message out of the blue from my bff from my college days basically asking what's up and to keep in touch. We just kind of lost touch a few years ago and she deleted me from the social network we'd message on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn college, we hit it off instantly (which in perspective was not a good thing). We were like sisters and  we'd shared every single details of our lives. We'd go on holidays together, knew each others families. We had our moments. However looking back, our friendship was toxic and imbalanced. We were polar opposites. At the time, I was the 'quiet' one, no self esteem, major social anxiety and was extremely codependent. I was the fat friend always in the shadow where as she was always demanding to be the center of attention. She had a very strong personality (that's why i guess we got along at the time), and we had to do things her way or she'd do a tantrum. It was sometimes really exhausting to be around her but at the times I had no boundaries (I didn't even know what they were!!!). When I needed her support, at least her to listen to what I was going through she'd use that as the opportunity to one up and say it has been worse for her.  She'd get possessive when I started talking to other people and socialised with others. In her mind, I was supposed to always be glued her (and yet she had other friends) . There were times where she'd humiliate me in front of the group for a laugh.  I also remember one time (at the early stages of knowing her) when I caught her making fun of me - but i was so naive back then that i thought it was a joke so I just kept on the friendship, but now i know better and i know she just didn't respect me. I was a very different person back then. If I had met her back then as the person I am now, we would have never been friends. We were very young when we met (I'm sure she has also changed too). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways... back to the present! I'm not interested in knowing how she's doing and I feel uncomfortable giving her details about my life (things are ok but I've been dealing with a few health issues that are time consuming and I rather keep that in the private sphere with my support system. I don't feel like telling someone i haven't spoken to in 5 years about my private business and what I'm dealing with). I'm not interested in keeping in touch and rekindling the friendship and yet for some reason i feel like it's an asshole move to not respond. I don't have any ill wishes towards her either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading everything ! I's be very thankful for any advice, input, experiences with handling this type of situation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL:dr** former bff from college years contacts me out of the blue.

Lately this friend has ended up getting on my nerves a lot and I'm wondering if I should kick them out of my house. To give a little bit of background information, I had mentioned to them that I was having trouble affording things, and they were still living with their parents (the person is in their late twenties), and we both thought it would be a good idea to end up living together to help cut costs and from them to gain more independence.\n\nFirst, they smoke like a chimney, like every 15 to 30 minutes they need to have half a cigarette, and to make matters worse, they are awake at late hours because of their work schedule so I get the pleasure of hearing them cough and spit all night. I've tried asking them about using the patch, but they just say that they've tried it before and it doesn't work. I have been feeling tired at work recently, and I can't help but wonder if it's because I'm not getting a deep level of sleep.\n\nNext, they are often preachy and condescending when talking. Every point is over explained and talked about for way too long, almost like they enjoy hearing themselves talk and trying to be superior to others (perhaps this is just my perception). I have recently taken to just looking away and not responding to avoid getting in one-sided conversation loops.\n\nAnother thing that happens a lot is them trying to instigate when I am angry at something. This usually happens when something they have said or done has irritated me and I'll say something like \"I need a break.\" or \"I need to go do something else for a while.\" or \"I don't like doing this.\" which is met with \"Why are you being such a pussy?\" or a million phone calls or messages about how I'm running away from my problems.\n\nLast, they have an addiction to alcohol and cigarettes that is going out of control. Tonight they got super drunk while we were playing a game and insisted on moving my computer for me despite me saying that I had it covered, then dropped some stuff and got angry at me for telling them that they were too drunk to be moving my stuff and that I could take care of it. They will also often drive drunk without caring at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - My friend does several things that annoy me, has addiction problems, and I kind of want to kick them out of my house.

So there is a guy i\u2019ve been talking to for a few months now. I know he sees me as a good friend and I once told him that I used to like him but did not mention that I still kind of do. We text every single day. I\u2019m the kind of person that doesn\u2019t text people often or anybody really except for my bestfriend and if we do text everyday, to me it means that there is something going on between us? But to him, i guess he just feel the need to text someone everyday even if they are just friends and I know he texts other girls too. He just got out of a relationship that left him broken and I was there for him and be his listening ear making sure he is alright and progressively moving on. He is still not over her yet and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s moving on any sooner because he still texts me about how much he misses her and tried to text her back but his ex really doesn\u2019t give two shits about him anymore.\n\nBut anyway I\u2019ve accepted the fact that we\u2019re just friends but sometimes I don\u2019t give a shit that he talks to other girls but sometimes I do and would get upset about it. The reason we started talking was also because he was just trying to make friends to keep him distracted from thinking about his ex. We actually talked before but he ghosted me because he met his ex. He is the first guy that I felt really comfortable with. Basically I just feel that I can be myself with him and thats rare. We have so many things in common and we just seem to click so well even when we first started talking. We care for each other, he listens to my rants and complains making sure i\u2019m okay and I do the same too. We share whats going on in our daily lifes, funny or interesting things that happened during the day (Things kind of change as you read this later on) I just feel a connection between us.

Furthermore, i mentioned how we care for each other but now things kind of changed, he doesn\u2019t seem to care about me as much as he used to when we first started talking. He mostly just rant to me about his problems. Doesn\u2019t really ask about my day or how i\u2019m feeling like he used to so i feel like i\u2019m his punching bag or just someone to spill his feelings out without considering mine.

Things have felt so different in my friend group this year. The vibes have changed so quick and everything feels so different. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the problem or anything, but I feel like i did something wrong.\n\nThere\u2019s ten people in my group. Before there was 9 but when I added a new member who I thought was really cool (and so did another one of my friends), I don\u2019t think the girls really liked the fact that I added him. Ever since I added him to the chat, they\u2019ve been a little more quiet but after a while they started talking again. But that\u2019s not the main thing that\u2019s bothering me.\n\nOne of my friends recently got into a break up and he\u2019s acting a little different around me. He\u2019s always been there for me in a brotherly type of way. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the breakup or if I said something that hurt him... I don\u2019t know. He still asks me if I wanna play video games and stuff like that up to this day but he\u2019s been different around me in a sense where it doesn\u2019t feel like the old days. In the past he always used to talk to me about his crush (whose in our group) and I always helped him through those times by talking to him. In addition to that we always talked about anything like it was a piece of cake. Now I feel like we can still talk but he\u2019s been a little salty to me when I say something, just a little bit but Idk if it\u2019s the breakup or if I\u2019m doing anything wrong.. I don\u2019t know. I feel like a horrible friend.\n\nLittle back story, there was this one time in the group where I talked behind his back. This is what\u2019s making me feel like a horrible friend. One of the members in our group thought that he liked her, but he didn\u2019t. I knew who he liked, and it was not that girl for a fact. But when she spilled the tea that she had this theory he liked her, I just texted her this comment like \u201cew\u201d at the idea he liked her. Coincidentally, he texted me the same thing and I also said something like \u201cbut you don\u2019t like her\u201d and I didn\u2019t tell either of them they didn\u2019t like each other. A few months later the guy I talked about in the previous paragraph got with the girl he liked (the girl he always talked to me about), but now his crush broke up with him and he became friends with the girl who mistakenly thought she liked him, when he did not. Things make me wonder if they tied two and two together and figured that I did nothing to her them to realize they didn\u2019t like each other. What if he knows I said ew or the other girl knows what I said about his crush. I really do regret that but I don\u2019t know if either of them knows I said that or if they found out just becoming friends.\n\nWhen my guy friend broke up with that one girl he always talked to me about, it was at the mall and I was there too. I did NOTHING to comfort him except stand around when I witnessed the break up. I also knew about it because the girl told me she was gonna do it. I feel like such a horrible friend. I did nothing to comfort him. \n\nWith the new year approaching I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings any more or risk anything. I don\u2019t know why my friend has been acting differently around me. I don\u2019t know if he knows about the day I said ew at him behind his back. I also don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just the fact that he got into a break up that he\u2019s acting different around me. Whatever the reason is, I feel like I\u2019ve been a horrible, fake friend. But through the days we\u2019ve been together as friends, I\u2019ve realized he was probably the realest person I could talk to. The day I said ew I really regret but that was only one day out of the four years we\u2019d been friends with each other. I don\u2019t know what I did wrong, but I don\u2019t want to lose this friendship or damage it any further :(\n\nI love my fiends so much already and I don\u2019t want to lose them. At the same time, I can\u2019t really draw a line if u did anything wrong. What should I do? \ud83d\ude1e", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Different flat, different job, different environment and a very different life situation. Too much can be quite tough and have led to a weird year for me. Currently I am working on bettering this and thought I might seek out a friend while doing so.\n\n**About me:** I heir from the cold mountainous land that is Norway. I\u2019ve always enjoyed tinkering with stuff and figuring out how things work. In later years I\u2019ve heard stories from when I was little. Apparently one of the biggest enjoyments 3 y/o me had was turning on/off light-switches and tearing apart my toys only to reassemble them. Getting older I have noticed things haven\u2019t really changed *too much*. I love tinkering with stuff like computers and smaller electronics and hope to one day maybe get somewhere in life by doing so.\n\nI really enjoy video games which is something that ties back to my early childhood playing that good ol\u2019 Nintendo 64. Nowadays I play most my games on PC. Even though I prefer single-player games mostly, I do occasionally play a few multiplayer games. My favorite type of genres are RPG/adventure types, games like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Half-Life etc. I would very much be up to trying some other types of games of course!\n\n**About you?:** What I am looking for here is just someone to talk to and someone who may share a few of my interests. I can be pretty passionate about the things I enjoy and can easily go rambling about them. (just a warning &lt;3) In conclusion I am all in for talking everything from toys for my cat to film recommendations. Generally I\u2019m very open minded and love to hear about different ideas and perspectives on all sorts of topics, just try me. Don\u2019t be afraid to send me a text, a PM here on Reddit will do!

I had real feelings for her in the first 6 months of our friendship (we were friends for 8 months). But a day I told her and I got rejected, this wasn't new for me but this time was special. I thought that we fitted so good together so I couldn't get rid of my feelings. But there was a problem, a week after I said it to her did I thought that my feelings were gone and the friendship should continue but I didn't realize until recently that I didn't get rid of them. This created some tension between us because I wanted a very close relationship she wasn't bothered by being close with me but she couldn't understand why we had to be close. This lead to some tension because I treated her like a girlfriend and expected her to treat me as a boyfriend. I got mad at her for the stupidest reasons mainly because she didn't express her love for me as much as I did for her. We left each other and I'm broken. I helped this girl into society when we started talking seriously I learned that she were lonely and had a minor social anxiety and now she has loads of friends because of me. I really loved this girl, but I don't want to come back with her. Right now I'm trying to treat myself nicely and get back to my \"real friends\" and sometimes when I'm sad about it I will sit in my bed and cry it out. Some of the the things I'm sad about is that it changed her so much, she's much more feminine and social than before. she has it obviously better.

And then I realized that I have no one to send it too and somehow a phone full of numbers. \n\nI\u2019m kind of a loner stuck in a room filled with people who aren\u2019t really my friends. I have a lot of people I know, see daily, hang out etc. but now that I want to talk about something personal with someone I just realized that out of my whole huge contact list - there\u2019s not one person who I could send that message to.\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s when it hit me. \n\n\nThat\u2019s really lonely. \n\n\nI can\u2019t say I don\u2019t have a nice family, but the thing is, family sometimes no matter how hard they try or how nice they are - they can\u2019t replace friends. You know, that elusive someone we all want to have - with whom we\u2019ll talk about our current crush, our tv obsession and unhealthy love for cookies. Who\u2019ll laugh with us at our stupid mistakes or talk us into doing a thing we\u2019re scared of but really want to do. \n\n\nWell here\u2019s me sending some good vibes out to the universe on Christmas and hoping I get a friend out of this :)\n\n\nWho am I and what am I looking for? Well I\u2019m a girl, (I want to believe somewhat good) student, Lover of cats - the animal not the new and very weird musical - 22 but not for a long time. If I were on Miss Universe I\u2019d probably be that basic bitch who says \u201cworld peace\u201d, I\u2019m a hopeless sucker for musicians who break my heart and I love calligraphy (those two aren\u2019t in any way connected). I don\u2019t have pets because on some days I barely can take care of myself, but I religiously pet every dog, cat, hamster etc. I see. I love ugly Christmas sweathers and yes I\u2019m that person who as soon as Halloween is over decorates her home for Christmas. And as people have told me - since I\u2019m honestly looking for a friend online and believing I\u2019ll find one - I must be an optimist. \n\nAs for you, if you made it this far you deserve a medal - which I don\u2019t really have one to give to you, but the thought counts, right? I don\u2019t care about your orientation, location, vocation (and all those other -ion things) I\u2019m just hoping someone might have read this and felt like they understand and hopefully I find that person - friend - I can send that text to. \n\nBye, R\n\nUpdate(if anyone ever checks this post): Hi everyone and thank you all so much! To be completely honest it was late and I fell asleep and when I woke up all the comments and messages were so nice and I was so overwhelmed with everything that I just didn\u2019t know how to handle all the messages and nice words! Also I was so sad to find so many people who felt so lonely like I did/do. I will give it my best shot at reaching out to all of you and I hope we all find that friend in someone and we can finally chase the lonely feeling away! \n\nTalk to you soon in DMs. \n\nAlso for anyone who stumbles upon this post on a later date - if it hits close to home and you want someone to talk to who knows the feeling - send me a DM. \n\nBye and thank you! \nRosie", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Although I'm a busy professional like so many, what I am conscious of doing proactively is talking and listening to those that have something they'd like to share. Humans are social beings, we all need real connection.\n\nI have a fairly broad knowledge of a lot of topics, yet if I don't know about something specific and you do, I'll more than likely ask you a ton of questions.\n\nI do like offering advice. I do like to talk and my mother says I can talk to a lamppost (She's right...).\n\nSo, pm me.

Looking at stupid Instagram stories, only to find that my two close friends were having a Christmas dinner without me. It was my friends, let's call them Natalie and Paula (both F31), and Natalie's sister and two friends. I know all of them but I'm close with N &amp; P. I didn't know anything about it and wasn't invited. And I had met up with Paula a few days before and asked her what she was up to on the weekend and she said \"I have a lot to do because I'm traveling and I have a dinner etc.\" It's just very hurtful because last year we had a dinner with Natalie, her sister, Paula and myself. And since we had talked about doing something before Christmas and them both saying they were busy or with their family I didn't think they were doing anything.\n\nI've been struggling with anxiety and depression pretty badly the past few years. In October I checked myself into a psychiatric facility because I thought I was going crazy. They've never personally told me that my issues were too much for them to handle or anything. Obviously I know it's hard to deal with, I have family members and friends struggling with mental illness and not being able to help is awful.\n\nTo note, Natalie has had an awful year. Her mom passed away after battling cancer in October and her godfather passed a few weeks ago, surprisingly. I really tried to be there for her, I told her I would come to the funeral of her mom or help her if she needed anything. I also informed Paula of Natalie's mom's passing because at the time she was abroad and I wanted her to know, in case she texted Natalie etc. And she was very grateful I had informed her.\n\nAnyways, I texted Natalie, addressed to both of them saying \"Hey guys, I just saw that you guys are having a Christmas dinner. I was honestly surprised and hurt to not know about it and not having been invited. I just wanted to ask what the reason was? Cause I feel like I\u2019ve committed some kind of crime?\u201c\n\nAnd Natalie's answer, the next afternoon was extremely hurtful, worse than finding out about this dinner. Her answer was a scathing message, seemingly filled with distain and contempt for me. She called my message \u201eegocentric and awful\u201c and was sad that I couldn\u2019t be happy for them.\n\nPlease tell me if I'm out of line to feel excluded and hurt by this? I feel like my world kind of crumbled, and it was already messed up before this. Where do I go from here? I feel like I'm an awful person after reading their responses and like I should apologize. I need some advice.\n\nTL;DR: my two close friends had a Christmas dinner without inviting me. I told them I was hurt and surprised and they told me it was egocentric and awful of me.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Most hispanics celebrate on the 24th and I remember years before how we would have parties and I would have friends over and it was fun and how much different I feel now. Maybe this is what growing up is, sometimes I just feel like im forcing myself into people to be friends or im usually the one initiating, I miss my best friend, how I could talk to her about LITERALLY everything, send memes and life would feel in place, I been going to the movies alone after work to past time, go to the gym and try to \"work on myself\" but I wish there was someone near me that would share my interest of just have a good heart. I learned how to love the \"good times\" no matter how short they are. Life just feel lonely atm, and if there was someone out there feeling the same, I would like to say that its ok, you should not ut yourself down because people cant appreciate what you can offer, just try to hold on and do things you enjoy, change it up. maybe one day, you will find your crew, make real friends, if your heart is in the right place, good things will happen, I have to believe that because if thats not true, then idk what im doing lol\n\nAnyways, sorry to kill the mood but I just needed to say that.\n\nHere's to a whole new decade.

I'm in the final year of my bachelor studies (Finance, with a focus on data analysis). I tend to dislike (and stumble at) superficial social interactions, so I avoid them and get my fill of conversations with my friends. I don't have a lot of them, so if you'd like to become one and think we \"click\", I'd love to hear from you.\n\nI haven't been diagnosed, but I suspect I'm somewhere on the autism spectrum. I have issues with handling emotions in myself or other people, and I like to suppress my own emotions and keep a clear head. I (over)analyze things around me a lot, and I like running my conclusions by like-minded people to hear their take. I'm very attentive to small details in things. The MBTI test (aka 16personalities, etc) classifies my personality as an INTJ and I find that pretty accurate (although scientific evidence for MBTI as a reliable personality test is pretty weak in general). I tend to be strongly focused on whichever goal I set and I dislike acting without having a plan beforehand.\n\nMy main interests are related to my major - data analysis is what I plan to do for the rest of my life, and economics in general is very interesting to me and has had a large impact on how I think (if you've read it, Freakonomics has been a massive source of inspiration to me). I'm also interested in cooking and coffee brewing as a hobby. I like contemporary art (fashion, installations, architecture and photography, and design if you count it as an art) and cinema (I like to analyze and talk at length about a movie I've seen if I'm talking to someone who's seen it as well). I'm currently learning to photograph. All of these would be great touching points to talk about, but if you share my approach of analyzing things around you, we should be able to converse easily, even if none of my interests match yours.\n\nThank you if you've made it this far.

Sorry in advance for the long story, as well as any mistakes. English is not my first language. Despite all that I would really appreciate you reading it. I'm a female, 23 years old. About two years ago I met a girl through my bestfriend Maria. Let's call her Mandy. \n\nMandy seemed pretty nice so we quickly became friends. She was studying abroad together with my bestfriend's boyfriend Bill and she even invited me to go stay with her multiple times (which I was grateful for) when Maria was visiting Bill. I tried my best to give back to her by buying all her groceries when I was staying and and bringing her a gift every time.\n\nHowever, during one of my visits I started seeing some red flags, which of course I ignored. She had suddenly started dressing the same way as I do (I'm not talking about a general style, I mean she had gone and bought the exact same clothes as me) and adopting most of my mannerisms. \n\nAt the time I found that weird, but I thought I was overreacting. It's surely a coincidence. \n\nThen the fun begins. She gets an absolute asshole of a boyfriend. Abusive, manipulative, the whole shebang. Let's call him POS.\n\nI tried to warn her multiple times, but she claimed she knew what was best for her and thought all her friends where jealous of how \"hot\" POS was. So I gave up.\n\nSometime later she invited me once again to visit her. I did have my reservations about going, but she assured me it would be a great time and Maria would be travelling with me, so I thought what could go wrong right? RIGHT?\n\nFirst of all, I met POS and apart from never leaving her house or giving us any time alone, he was also blatantly hitting on me in front of her. She instead of being angry at him, seemed angry at me. I started feeling so akward around them I wanted to gtfo but I thought I would seem not appreciative of her letting me in her house. \n\nOne day I was meeting with some people I've met there and as usual Mandy told me she had to study with POS and couldn't come. I was like ok sure but will you be up to let me in when I come back home? She said yes and not to worry. I even told her I could stay at Bill's house if she wanted to sleep early. She reassured me she would be awake.\n\nSo, I go out with the group and honestly have a great time. But when it's time to go home I call her to make sure she is awake. She picks up and tells me she'll be waiting for me. \n\nGuess who was not awake after 15 minutes when I got home? Also, guess who waited almost an hour in the freezing cold trying to wake her up. In a foreign country. Ah that was me. After  she woke up she looked at me up and down and instead of a simple sorry she said: \"I was having such a nightmare.\" \n\nAfter that, I confided in Maria, Bill and one of Bill's friends, George, about the situation. Bill and George started telling me that's just how she is and that she is always inconsiderate. That I should not have to put up with her. I thought it's just a few more days, I will get this over with and just never come back.\n\nFast forward two days later we were all at a club. When Mandy was not there, POS would come whispering in my ear how hot I was and other creepy stuff every ten seconds. I told George and he asked me if I would like to go outside with him. Once again I was like ok sure. We talked about nonsense but after a while he leaned in and kissed me. I was startled but not against it as I found him attractive and he seemed pretty cool. He asked me if I would like to sleep at his place and promised he would not touch me if I didn't want to as I had told him I prefer moving slower (and he didn't we just watched some movies while cuddling and fell asleep).\n\nAt 06.00 the doorbell at George's house rang and guess who it was. Mandy. After I explained what had happened she looked kind of mad and told us to take care of each other (??).\n\nAnyway, me and Maria were leaving the next day and the group wanted to have something like a goodbye party for us. We would all hang out at George's place. I packed my stuff from Mandy's house and asked her if she would come. She said yes of course!! She never did. \n\nI was hurt she didn't even come on our last day there but oh well. \n\nTime goes by. I was talking with George everyday and he was going to come and visit me next month. He was kind of clingy some times and always asked me if I was not excited for him to visit him but I reassured him I was, as I had started really liking the guy after talking so much.\n\nBut then he starts replying after days or not replying at all. I ask him if everything was ok and he said \"of course dummy! I will be coming to see you in 10 days\".  \n\nThen Mandy breaks up.\n\nHe really did come to my hometown. However, he never messaged me. I was pretty shocked. But I got over it. \n\nOnce again, time goes by. I start seeing weird instagram stories from both George and Mandy where they were pretty lovie dovie. I don't give it too much thought.\n\nAfter not having spoken for many months Mandy starts messaging me all the time. I wanted nothing to do with her, but I remained cordial. \n\nAnd that leads us to current time. She is back in our hometown for the holidays. And after her insisting we should meet because she missed me so SO much, i decided to give her another chance.\n\nWe meet outside a club and she immediatly starts apologizing in front of all our friends about what had happened when I stayed with her. She told me how much she has changed after breaking up with POS. I wanted to believe her but told her we should discuss this another time over coffee.\n\nHowever, when we visit the washroom and we are just the two of us she drops the bomb: \"Guess who I'm going out with\" she asks with the most smug face I have ever seen. \"I'll give you a hint you have also made out with him, it's George.\". She asks me if I thought he was a good kisser. She tells me how he told her he always wanted her. I just told her \"Oh that's great.\"\n\nI don't care about what they do with each other. My issue was that it seemed so intentional how she apologized for everything in front of other people but when we were alone she was obviously not sorry for anything and tried taunting me. I remained calm until I got home.\n\nLater I found out that she had told some friends she liked George first so I was the asshole for not asking her before we kissed. 1. She had a boyfriend of almost a year at that time. 2. She had only told me she thought George was hot a year prior when she was single and had told me the same thing about most of the guys we met. But oh well, I'm the asshole once again. She also told them I visited her uninvited (which is completely untrue) so she had no idea why I was mad at her being a bad host. \n\nMoreover George and Bill (now my bestfriend's ex) have told Mandy I was always badmouthing her, although they were the ones doing it and how George never really liked me and I was just another crazy bitch going after him. \n\nPeople of reddit, what should I do? Why am I always made out to be the villain? Have I been in the wrong all this time? Should I accept her apology and move on? Or should I follow my guts and never have anything to do with any of them?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

As of lately, the past year I would say I realize that maybe I can\u2019t talk to them about anything, our interest have changed a bit and even though the road has been tough for all of us, it seems like I am the only one following my dreams and achieving at least some of my goals. \n\nAnything I have suggested in doing no one shows interest anymore. Can\u2019t get them to go on spontaneous trips with me, they don\u2019t want to travel, don\u2019t want to go out dancing with me, or even try to have a deep meaningful conversation with me. I ask them about their goals and dreams and now it\u2019s a bunch of I don\u2019t knows not even an idea. \n\nI love them I really do but I feel like their negativity and wanting to do nothing is affecting me in thinking the same way. There are so many good memories and these are people I could count on for so long. \n\nI need new genuine friends to talk with even though I am awkward and it takes me awhile to warm up to people. \n\nWhat do I do, I need some advice?", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

That I shouldn't get attached to them, should not expect deep conversations and sharing with and I shouldn't be hurt if they don't ever call or text unless I call them first. Am I some sort of alien for expecting a real bond with people whom I call friends? Is it true that this is the norm - not really caring about each other and just using them for a few laughs every now and then?

This has prevented me from progressing.\n\nFrom reading this, you might think that I am paranoid about him targetting me. However, he has made a few things very clear over the years, he has said it to me directly:\n\n\u2022 He does not want me to be happy; and he will do anything and everything in his power to stop it. \n\n\u2022 His goal is for me to die alone. He is striving for this and I will explain how. \n\nMy brother and I were extremely close while growing up. When I began University, my brother chose to work instead. This was in 2009 and we had a different set of friends. So there would be times where I would be out and he would be at home bored, he would give me a call to see where I was, and ask if he could come and hang out with me. I would never say no.\n\nOne day I was sitting at a girls house, I asked if I could bring my brother and they said that was fine. The girl I was friends with and my brother fell instantly in love. Literally. Instantly. In. Love. Which is not a bad thing. However, it all started from there.\n\nMy brother wanted to move in with this girl, my parents opposed. Then one day he left and never came back. Unfortunately, she lived in walking distance to my house, so my brother had ample opportunity to expose his true nature: An absolute pig.\n\nMy brother developed the idea that I wanted a relationship with her. He maintained this idea for an unacceptable amount of time. I still think he might. \n\nAnyways, from there on in, I was constantly barraged by my brother. He would be hiding in corners just lurking and waiting for me as I would be walking home from university for a chance to beat me. I'd arrive home from university, my parents would be telling me off:\n\"She was your mate, you introduced them, this is your fault.\"\n\nThey ended up getting married a few short months later and at this current time my parents have eased up a bit, as my brother and his wife had a baby. Although from the beginning of their relationship onwards, my brother has not stopped giving a hard time. \n\nHe has approached every single individual and has said that I am a homosexual. I have no problem with people of that orientation at all - however, my aim is to get married. It is impossible to try and court anybody that I met during my life, this because my brother has implanted the idea in their minds that they're not my type. \n\nI will give you an example:\nThis happened in about 2013, I took a girl out to dinner. It was a long line, due to it being a Saturday, but it was a very popular place. During the dinner we would be talking, the girl will say something along the lines of:\n\"Oh, I thought you were gay.\"\nI'd ask where they got that idea from, they would say my brother.\n\nThat is not an isolated incident. We went to the same school, so he knew most of the girls. He would contact their families on Facebook. Spinning tales, just spinning tales about me being gay. Sometimes he likes to zest it up and call me a drug dealer. \n\nAfter we would clear all that up, the date only wants to talk about that issue. Its just really annoying.\n\nSo my girl situation is not so good. As these people wonder why it is so necessary for my brother to \"message and warn them.\" Ive been shown the messages, and the girl I would be speaking too, or one of her siblings will say:\n\"But your brother said it. Why would he go out of his way to do that?\"\n\nAt this point in time, I've literally run out of \"people that I was friends\". He has completely destroyed that aspect. To add insult to injury, he makes dating profiles in attempt to also mess with me.\n\nI know this because he made no secret of the amount of dedication he put into locating me. He thinks he is \"super sleuth\", he loves this he thinks its a game, and he is on his eternal quest to continue making my life.\n\nWhat he failed to see though, was that chatting with me on a dating app, pretending to be somebody you're not and asking extremely, extremely freaky questions, is super damaging. \n\nIn 2014 - I was on a delivery route for work with a former colleague. Luckily it was smackbang peak hour traffic. I got a message on my mobile, and it was a screenshot. It was a screenshot of a conversation I had on one of the dating apps. It came from my brother. I immediately threw up in the car, all over the steering wheel (sorry to disgust), the left of my face went numb, then it just drooped slightly. It remained that way for four months. \n\nIm not a smoker, I haven't had a fast food meal in about 7 years, I take very good care of myself and exercise daily. I have/had no underlying issue for that to have happened. His actions appalled me - thats the only thing that could explain it. \n\nAnd it didn't stop there. After that had happened, I just gave up on him. I have no idea where his anger is coming from, I don't know he is always enraged and talking smack about me, he is married, he has child, surely he must have something better to do. At the beginning of 2015 I told myself Im just going change my number, withdraw from the public eye for a bit, give my brother \"some time to actually miss me\", then try again later.\n\nIn doing that, I essentially opened the gates of hell for myself. It was like setting a like setting a wild dog loose: His mouth didn't stop and he ramped up his efforts to screw me around. \n\nHe was contacting anybody, who is everybody trying to locate me, see who I'm with, what I was doing. Luckily, I befriended people from my school, who coincidentally, were bullied by my brother and his cohort. My brother contacted them, and they're family, spinning his usual shit. \n\nI was at their home when he contacted them, they were dumbstruck as to he was contacting them. They were aware also of how bad my brother can really be. So I remained friends with these people, at least there was one person that had not fallen for my brothers tales. \n\nUntil 2017, I avoided him like the plague. Or at least tried. I changed my address four times, he kept on obtaining my address. Absolutely no reason to do so. He is that bent on making me miserable, the second he would get my address he would come, and just smash something.\n\nThere no warning, no contact, no events leading up to him coming. It would be a random smash, we would run to the window and just see my brother waddling off. Be it a window, door or a wall, he just had this urge to do it. I know it sounds silly, I cant explain it and I don't know why.\n\nIn 2016, he achieved his goal of alienating me from the world. I used to be extremely popular before my brother started his antics, but by 2016 I was down to two friends. He was extremely pleased. \n\nBy that time I had cut off everything to do with him, and I just wanted to start anew. Everything was going swimmingly, this is because his wife was expecting that year, he had no choice but to be busy. \n\nIn my experience, once a man has his first child his demeanor will change. Not for my brother though. Nope. He just got worse. I didnt realize this until after the damage was done. \n\nI invited my brother to my home in 2016 (worst mistake ever - I have never made a worse mistake than that) on the premise that I was congratulating him on welcoming his first child. I assumed he had changed. He rocks up to my house, I say hello, its been a while, congratulations. He wasn't holding a baby though, he was holding McDonald's. He just shoved it in my face and said:\n\"I brought you food.\"\n\nHe knows that I dont eat fast food, he knows I wasn't going to eat it, so he dug into that meal. I asked to see the baby, he said it's a quick visit, the baby is asleep in the car with my wife you can see him another day. When he said that, alarm bells rang:\n\"Why did he come...\"\n\nHe started asking questions, one of the questions was about my landlord. Who coincidentally, lived next door. This was at about 9pm. I farewelled my brother, and I saw him walk to his car. Normally I would wait for the car to leave before going inside (as I do with any guest), but I just didn't that evening. I just didnt want too. I really should have though. My brother didn't go home, he got out of his car and went to my landlords house the second I went back inside. \n\nThe next morning, my door literally broke down. The landlord had kicked it down. Screaming and yelling at me to pack my things and leave. I was getting ready for work, and he just kept saying:\n\"You have meth lab in here! You're a drug dealer! You faggot get the f*** out or I'm calling the police.\"\n\nAt that point, my face started to do that thing again. I showed him around and showed him how clean and pristine the place was, but my landlord was having none of it. The conversation went like this, and is forever etched in my memory.\n\nLandlord: \"Your brother came to my house last night and told me everything!\"\nMe: \"What? What everything? What on earth are you talking about\"\nLandlord: \"You make meth, you sell drugs, he offered to help me get you out if you dont leave today. He has offered to come with me to the police station!\"\nMe: \"Wait slow down. Can we start with why my brother was at your house?\"\n\nI was fuming inside, but I had to remain calm. I assured him that my brother is lying, I tried to explain the situation briefly, he wasnt having any of it. \n\nLandlord: \"Im gonna call your brother, do not say anything, I am going to put him on speaker, you're going to hear it come from his mouth.\" \nMe: \"Alright, I don't believe any of this, but okay.\"\n(Calls my brother)\nLandlord: \"What did you tell me yesterday about your brother.\"\nMy Brother: (Saying ever so loudly and proudly) \"I told you that my brother is a gay drug dealer who makes and sells meth. If you can't get him removed from your house today, call me, and I will come with you to the police station to help get him removed.\"\nMe: Hey bro you're on speaker.\n[Phone line cuts out instantly]\n\nI had nowhere to go, I was shattered that my brother did that. Disgusted. I've never in my life done that to anybody. My brother does have an underlying MH condition, he refuses to address it. \n\nIn any case, I confronted my brother about it. He just kept on denying that he said anything. It was like talking to a brick wall. My brother is one of those people who will lie and lie, I think it's compulsive lying, but it gets aggravated when he is stressed. So he's sitting there getting enraged, denying that he even went to my landlords house. There's nothing you can do in that situation, he is unable accept responsibility. \n\nIn the end, I lost the place, I lost a lot my things and dwelled around for two weeks till I was able to secure alternative accommodation. \n\nDuring the New Year Period, my brother barraged me with texts that were extremely unacceptable. I wont divulge them too much, because nobody should have to see them. But he messaged me over 175 times telling me to commit suicide, telling how and why I should do it. Im not weak of mind. So I kind of just ignored them. But after reading what he had to say, I cannot comprehend how somebody can have so much hate within their heart.\n\nIn 2017. My dad pulled us both up, and just asked, out of respect for him. That we get along on civil terms. I asked my dad is it okay we go for a drive, and I asked:\n\n\"You know dad cant you see how crap he is? I've never wronged him, I dont have the energy to invest into the antics he does. He's married and has a child. However he is obsessing a lot over me, I don't know how he has the energy.\" \n\nMy dad replies by saying he knows, but he also that I am the mature one. That's why he expects me to put up with his crap. My dad knows that my brother can be an extremely difficult person, my aunties have also approached me at one time or another, saying:\n\"We see how bad you have it, but from a young age you've dealt with most matters in a mature manner. Plus you're much calmer than your brother, and much more focused.\" \n\nI thought they were just buttering me up at first, but then I thought about it, and they didn't have to come up and explain that to me, so I took it as a compliment. \n\nAfter I had spoken with my dad, I changed my number, for 43rd time in my life. I again, withdrew, I had no friends at this point. But at this point, I think I was just ready for some reflection.\n\nThankfully I was working, had a routine, work, train, come home and just, reflect. I felt like my mind needed to rest. Slowly, I started to get back out there again, I started going back to Church (I was extremely devout in my younger years), started making a few new friends. I reconnected with an old High School girlfriend. \n\nMy brother (dont know how he keeps getting my number - I know he takes my dad's phone and just browses through it randomly so Im assuming it's gotten to him from there) messages me around Jun 2017. Asking me if I have Nintendo Switch.\n\nI guess this was just his way of reaching out. I told him that I did, and I asked him if he had one. He said that he didn't, told me a sob story as to why he couldnt afford one, lied and said his son was sick. Then asked me to buy him a Switch. \n\nHe takes advantage of the fact that I will never turn my back on my family. As much as he put me through, after all he said, I am always ready to forgive. He came over, I had the Switch ready, and he asked to visit my retro console room. \n\nHe looked like a kid in a candy store. His face reflected that of a kid on Christmas morning. \n\nHe asked for some goods, I warned him to not sell anything because I would have gone through hell to get it; he wanted to \"borrow\" them for a few months. \n\nLong story short: He sold everything I gave him, he even sold the Nintendo Switch he asked for. This is where it gets slimy. My brother came to my house again, asking for a Switch. I asked what had happened, he said that \"his son broke it.\" I let him have it first time. He then asked for games. I asked why he threw out the games, controllers and accessories, he just shrugged. \n\nAfter about another fortnight, my brothers switch again broke, this time \"his wife broke it.\" I pointed out if a Switch breaks, you can just connect it to the television and go from there. Apparently she also broke the docking station. So, reluctantly, after hearing his tale, I gave him another one. I made it clear, do not ask again.\n\nI had also purchased Switch consoles for the rest of my siblings. I chose too though, I wanted them to have one each. \n\nOne day I was hanging out with my sister, she was lamenting work. She then asked if she could another Nintendo Switch, as she reluctantly gave it to our brother. He told her that \"his wife broke it\". He also did that with our other two siblings. \n\nNothing we could do, we felt sorry for him. He is very shit with money. Extremely terrible. He needs to feed his family, so he will sell anything, even if it isnt his.\n\nIn 2017 August, my brother asked if I knew anybody that wanted to work as a labourer. I had a friend who was here from Japan on a working holiday. My brother blackened my name with that guy. My brother refused to pay him, took advantage of the fact he cannot speak English very well and just treated him like walking garbage. I had to go and deliver lunch to the poor guy because my brother bought lunch for everybody else, but him. \n\nAnother person, who is now a former friend, went to work with my brother. \n\nI picked up the person after he had finished work to take him home. The conversation went like this:\n\nFriend: \"Dude what is wrong with your brother?\"\nMe: \"What do you mean?\"\nFriend: \"He did not shut up about you the entire day, his mouth was like a motor, I even got sick of hearing about you.\"\nMe: \"I don't know what to say\"\nFriend: \"You buy him a lot of stuff and he just wont shut up about you, he tried to convince me you're gay, telling me youre a drug dealer.\"\n\nAt the end I just didn't know what to say. \n\nMy brother hasnt stopped, he will not stop. Even with the old high school girlfriend I mentioned, he managed to get up in that situation too. \n\nI know it sounds crazy, I really do. But these are his antics. If I try so much as make a friend, my brother everything and anything he can to stop it. \n\nThe stalking is getting really creepy as well, because it's humiliating when you have this person just coming and smashing windows randomly. He feels that he must.\n\nIve tried to speak to him about it - he categorically denies everything. \n\nHe still does it, but still denies everything. \n\nI have no idea why he's so obsessed with me. I can't be civil with him. He wont allow me to have friends, I cannot reiterate enough that this person goes out of his way to stalk me, or see who im hanging out with and make contact with them.\n\nI really want to start anew, I dont want to have to move again because it's just getting tiring. He just wont stop seeping into my personal/private life. I've tried cutting him off completely, but he finds his way back in. \n\nIts exhausting, and its been going on for way too long. \n\nTL;DR: there is so much more I can add to this, he's given me years of hell. Especially with the dating profile thing. Its pretty hard to make friends when your character has been assassinated.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We used to be friends with another girl our age who was mean and manipulative and a few months ago she decided to stop speaking to both of us. My bff and this third friend were always closer with each other than to me and while we were all friends I often felt like a third wheel. While the third friend wasn\u2019t speaking to us, she was talking to everyone else about us. She told our mutual friends and my co workers that I was never a good friend and insulted me and my bff whenever she could to whoever would listen. Me and my bff have grown closer these past few months and we have a good relationship now, as I stated we even plan on moving in together, we have the space and everything. \nRecently this third friend has reached out to my bff and they\u2019ve decided to rekindle their friendship despite all the things she said about her and I.  My bff asked me if it was okay to be friend with her bc she values how I feel about it and she doesn\u2019t want to make me uncomfortable. I said it was fine bc I don\u2019t ever want to give her any ultimatums but I\u2019m scared of being forgotten. My bff and the third friend have a stronger bond than her and I and it makes me feel sad. \n   Today we were hanging out and she answered a FaceTime from the third friend and ignored me while they talked, she didn\u2019t even tell the third friend that I was there. I felt horrible so I ordered an Uber and I left. She asked me if I was mad at her and I said no bc I was literally on the verge of tears. I don\u2019t know what to do \nDo I remain friends with her? \nDo I try to address the issue if so, how? \nIs it still a good idea to move in together? \nThis incident is very fresh I feel heartbroken at the moment I feel like this will only get worse as they mend their friendship and I feel horrible for not wanting her to be friends with the third friend \n\nI hope this is coherent lol help!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I am a pretty forgiving person, so I usually just wait things out and discuss stuff, but I am getting tired honestly. Recently, I was spending the night and the older one blew up bc her dog peed on the bed, basically kicked me out of her room bc she was mad about the dog. She didn\u2019t even apologize either. Then the other younger sister was being passive aggressive and petty towards me bc of an argument with her boyfriend. She also didn\u2019t apologize.

I rarely watch anime, as in maybe once a year, but recently I have watched the fourth season of Food Wars, Cautious Hero, and both seasons of Mob Psycho 2 (10/10 recommend).\n\nI like chill/grove, elecroswing, electric/edm music in general, however when I am stressed or depressed (which lately has been all the time), I don't listen to anything much less anything new. I recommend checking out Jakubi for chill type music or Sanjou no Hana. Along with finding new music, writing has also been a causality of my depression. I used to have so many ideas to write about. Now I just see them in my head and have no desire to write them. It's almost triggering nowadays to write.\n\nLately I have been trying to get into linear algebra as an attempt to try to get some normalcy back.

The issue resolved itself- I no longer have my life threatening condition nor do I have the chronic pain it caused. However I developed other issues indirectly as a result of this, and I got very burned out. I live in a very toxic environment (I used to have a therapist for my PTSD and she said that my parents are emotionally abusive) and my parents pushed medical school strongly for YEARS, and I was so drained after my surgeries and resulting issues that it was all I could do to just graduate. I did so well before my surgeries, and I did poorly afterwards and got so burnt out. I was too late to apply to medical school and at this point I got fed up and am now in a second gap year trying to recover. But the more I try to solve my health problems, the more problems I seem to get as a result (like my gynecologist did a saline ultrasound one month ago and it still hurts).

We bonded from the start and are very close with each other. We\u2019ve had plenty of conflicts, but we can easily work things out and it has made our friendship stronger. I thought that we were at a point where we don\u2019t fight much anymore, because puberty is coming to an end. But we have a conflict right now and I don\u2019t understand it.\n\nSo a little backstory to help you understand things more. I have had a very difficult childhood, and she has had some problems too, but on a whole different level. (My parents fought a lot, her parents made it a competition between her and her siblings about who is the most successful...) We grew up in very different situations. \n\nA few months ago, my mom and I broke contact with each other. (I didn\u2019t have contact with the rest of my family at this point so besides my mom, I have no one) She kind of kicked me out but I also didn\u2019t want to live with her anymore. There were always fights, they ( my mom and stepdad) blamed me for everything and it was just overal very toxic. I started college in the meantime and I sometimes lost hope in the future. It was a chaos and I was mentally exhausted from the situation. Luckily I have good people around me who helped me get through this, and I felt supported, but I also felt very sad and lonely through it all. \n\nMy best friend was there for me but not always, I didn\u2019t think much of it because I had other people who helped me, I had no hard feelings towards her. I knew that she had her problems and I didn\u2019t want to burden her too much with my problems. \n\nA week ago, she texted me out of the blue about how terrible our friendship is. She said that she\u2019s been at her lowest and worded things very  mean to me. She didn\u2019t feel supported by me, said that our friendship is a one way friendship, and that I don\u2019t care about her. She said that she would go through fire for me and I wouldn\u2019t do the same. I was very confused, I really didn\u2019t know what she was saying. She told me that alot of people came to her to talk about how bad our friendship is, and she then told me that she doesn\u2019t know if she wants to go further like this. She told me to put my feelings aside and to be there for her, but I can\u2019t suddenly do that. She made me feel like my situation is dramatic and that I should forget about my problems and try to focus on helping her out first. \n\nShe never once told me that she was going through a hard time, and I couldn\u2019t see it because she studies in a different city, so our main kind of contact is via our phones. \nShe always told me that she was fine, it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t ask. \nI\u2019m just so hurt by what she said and how she said it, it was in a very defensive tone. \nShe said some things that triggered me, because it would remind me of how my mom would react. Idk, I\u2019m in a strange position. \n\nI want to help her because now it\u2019s clear that she has a difficult time, and I want to be there for her. I can\u2019t put my situation aside to help her before I help myself, because I\u2019m barely holding it together, I\u2019ve tried to make it clear that I\u2019m nowhere near happy at this point in my life.  \n\nShe worded things so wrong, that I\u2019m hurt and angry.

As I don't have anything to do there right now (starting a new job in January), I feel kind of lonely. I went to get to know some people but I still don't have any own friends there, just co-students of my boyfriend.\nSo I'm quite lonely there.\n\n\nNow, I travelled back to my home city for Christmas but nobody seems to be interested in me anymore. \nSo, starting about 1,5 years back. I organized a huge surprise party for a friend's 25th birthday (we share some friends) and all were saying next huge party should then be mine (as I was the one getting 25 next). \nI didn't even want a surprise party but it's like a tradition for me that each year, I invite some of my best friends to my parents house for a nice evening with raclette on my birthday (today, 27th of december).\nThey all know about it and the last years, I always had 2 to 4 friends with me.\nSo, this year, I asked them to visit on my birthday the usual ~2 weeks early.\nHowever, all declined. No time, working, I'll.be coming if you make a real party, not responding, ...\nThe worst: I knew it were all their real reasons and not just some so they could still surprise me.\nOne friend said she will still be coming but just called because she has to clean the basement -.-\nWe'll meet tomorrow (if she doesn't decline again) but that's not the same.\nAnd my long-time best friend didn't even respond me, not to Christmas, not 2 weeks before, didn't write today -.-\n\n\nHowever, that's not all: My parents did make Christmas and my birthday worse, too.\nThey do not have a lot of money, so I asked them prior, if we will even share presents on Christmas.\nMy mother told me I don't have to buy them anything but I will be getting a gift she is sure I'm gonna love.\nSo, Christmas comes, we had a really nice evening with my boyfriend's family on the 24th and all was fine.\nThen, for the 25th, my parents agreed to fetch us in a larger town nearby (our car also broke some days before Christmas, so next bad thing in the last days). However, as I wrote them my mum just told me they're still busy and we should look how to get to them elsewise. Some discussion later she agreed my dad will pick us up but it could take some time...\nWe were at my aunts house so not that big of a problem.\nHowever, she didn't respond spend anymore and in the end, my aunt drove us to my parents.\nWe arrived there, said hello and my mom went to the rabbits to clean them, etc.\nWhen my dad suggested starting to make the dinner she was angry that she wouldn't be so fast...\nSo he didn't start it\nMy boyfriend was a bit sick at that time so he just layed down a bit.\nIn the end, we went to eat at 1am (in the night).\nAt 2am, my mom ignored us wanting to share presents and go to bed and disappeared on the toilet (her free time, so she takes looong) to return quarter to 3. However, she then began making meds for the rabbits, cleaning the dishes,... But didn't come back even after nicely along her some times. About quarter past 3, my father like screamed at her (in a still not so bad tone) she should just stop and come to us.\nWe gave her and my father our presents (nothing big, a snow ball for her and a mobile phone case for him, but in Total about 20\u20ac). They were thankful and she just got up to clean the dishes again.\nWe disappeared in bed.\nSo, the next day, yesterday, all My 3 cousins each got 10\u20ac (or probably more, I only asked the youngest (10yo) how much he got and the older ones usually got more the last years) from them...\nSo they spent at least 30\u20ac for Christmas for my cousins while I got nothing even though they said Differently beforehand.\nThen, in the night, when my birthday (my 25th!) just had started, they began fighting over nonsense and ignored when I told them about the nice board game my boyfriend had gifted me (yeah, I opened it early as I was still frustrated over Christmas and he wanted me to smile again).\nSo, we went to bed..\n\n\nAnd today is my birthday. I came down to them, they were talking about things, Casually asking how I slept and it still took about 5 mins until they Finally told me Happy Birthday. However, that was all. No candles or an easy birthday card (I always got one card in an envelope with the number of my birthday written on. Always.). And no other presents. Not even a 1\u20ac-chocolate or anything small that would have been easily affordable (my mum was even eating some chocolate by herself later). I'm OK with not getting much as I know about their money situation in general. But it hurts to not even get a 'we recognize it's your birthday present'...\nAnd then the 'best' happened. My mum handed me a letter of Vodafone stating they want 130\u20ac of me and if I don't pay them immediately will charge 300 more... I didn't make any contract with them but my father wanted to make one in March and used my data for getting the offer...\nI called Vodafone immediately and they are going to cancel everything (the contract as well as the bill) as I didn't sign anything but... My father said he didn't do anything and it's completely Vodafone's fault if they form a contract of an offer like that. He doesn't even think using my data was wrong -.-\nI accepted their option as you can't discuss those things with my mom and it would have just resulted in a big fight. \n\n\nHowever, now (7pm, Germany) I'm laying here, knowing no one of my friends is gonna visit, with my boyfriend next to me (the only person trying to make me a nice bday but it it's just too much and he can't do anything to make me Happy :-/) and am Totally sad, frustrated and feel completely lonely and as if I don't have any friends.\nMost didn't even write me for my birthday...\nI just want to get some kind words, some birthday greetings and have at least some people maybe trying to be something like friends to me.\n\n\n\nTldr:\nNo one of my friends wants to visit me on my 25th birthday today even if it's tradition with them, my parenta completely failed Christmas this year and didn't even get me a small 'just to be there' present (not for today and not for Christmas) but spend 30+\u20ac for my cousins. \nAnd I nearly had to pay a lot on a contract my father made in my name without asking me. \nAnd My long time best friend doesn't even write me and some others also just forgot about my birthday...\nJust feeling completely lonely and unloved right now and just needing some friends :-/", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

She grew up in a rich family and pretty much got everything she ever wanted. For example, her mom recently paid more than $12,000 for cosmetic surgeries like lipo even though she really didn't need any of it. Also, her mom is currently paying for her to live at a very expensive apartment, even though she's 25 years old.  She was already pretty thin and is considered beautiful by everyone that we know. Her therapist told her that she is a victim because growing up her family told her what to do, and to not talk back to her parents. Personally, I feel like this is a pretty normal thing for parents to do because as children we obviously shouldn't allowed to do anything we want. But apparently, this traumatized her to such an extent that she is constantly treated like a doormat by the guys she dates. She refuses to stand up for herself, and even said to me \"i know i'm weak but I'm just going to accept this and see where this goes\" when  i confronted her about how a guy she's dating is treating her. And not only that, she consistently doing badly in school (she's and undergrad) and this most recent semester she actually failed every single one of her classes. But unfortunately when i ask her about how she's doing instead of saying she's stressing out about school she always says she's stressed out about the guy she's dating. I just don't know if I'm being harsh or not, but I honestly don't see her as a victim because I see the way her family treats her and how supportive they are. I know most people will say that I'm not in her shoes so I wouldn't know what exactly is going on within her family, but I'm extremely close with her and she tells me everything from her past to her present. But yea I would appreciate some advice on whether I am being harsh and not seeing something else thats there that would make her be like this.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She will hide her thieving kids from the police and pee in a cup for her drug addicted brother so he can qualify for a new job. I respect police and obey even the most insignificant of laws.....mind you I'm no saint but what she does, allows her kids to do and the examples she sets for the kids goes against my grain.\n\nThen there is the matter of our business. All of our supplies are at her house because I left me husband and moved into a small house. She holds the money for our business too. I know for a fact she has *borrowed* from our stash when she was strapped. I assume she always replaced but I really don't know.\n\nI spent almost $600 of my own money to invest into the business by purchasing a special printer which stays at her house like everything else. Her house is over-run with roaches. There is insect feces all inside my expensive equipment.

I don't know why, but she became like an obsession. I need to check my phone every second while waiting for reply, I probably don't even realize how much I think about her every day, every hour. Any slight shift in mood or 'tone' in her messages can instantly make me go crazy. The thought of other friends she might (and does) have terrifies me too, of how the conversations they have are probably way better, how they help her more, how they can make her laugh more than I ever will. I NEVER in my life was the jealous type, not on the scale this is. I'm not like this with any of my irl's, with other internet friends. I don't panic if I'm left on seen with others, I don't mentally note when was the last time they said something nice about us, me.

I have three friends, I will name them K, B, and A for privacy reasons. We've all been friends for about five years now, and we're all female. \n\nEven though we've had such a long friendship, I've never really grown too attached to them. In fact, I've felt that our friendship has dwindled over it's life-span. All of us only really became friends because we all shared another friend at school, and I don't think they would have become friends with me at all without the common friend. \n\nI'll start with K. She complains a lot about a ton of different things and is very rude to other people. She is also an SJW who constantly reminds me and the others about all sorts of different \"injustices\" that I frankly don't care about. K can be very mean to people at school, and will gossip about the \"weird\" kids at school constantly. I am very kind to the less fortunate and outcasts of my school, but she'll badger me about why I am nice to them or why I hang out with them, and will sometimes make fun of me for it. She pushes her agendas and morality into my face, and gets pissed whenever I disagree with something or even show some bias to certain topics. K complains about her religious parents, and makes fun of me for being religious. She's probably my least favorite friend of the bunch.\n\nA is very energetic and (it feels rude to say this) annoying. She constantly shouts at me, plays jokes that get on my nerves, and kicks my backpack or steals my phone and personal items. She'll kick, punch, and trip me around school and will laugh about it. She keeps telling me and the entire school that I have a boyfriend (who is just some kid at school that I have never met before) and has created Instagram stories and has texted people about my \"love\" for this one poor dude (who she knows that I don't even like).  I get 100+ texts from her a day where she'll just send me memes or tell me 'Ur mom gae' jokes over and over, and if I don't reply, she'll get mad at me. She's also somewhat of an SJW, who speaks about her opinion constantly, and gets upset whenever I politely point out my opinion of something political. She constantly annoys me during class, and has gotten me in trouble multiple times for throwing notes at me and talking. I've never really stood up to her about how she acts, which might be partly my fault, but it's been going on for so long that I don't think that she knows it bothers me.  \n\nB is the kind of friend that is the annoying kind of shy. She never speaks up, and lets people walk all over her. I try to help her boost her confidence, but it drains me with what I already have going on. K and A just ignore her, and it makes me feel bad for her but I also know that it's somewhat of her fault for not wanting to interact with them. She's too shy to find partners for school projects, so I am usually having to be her partner since nobody else will. She never puts full effort into assignments, so I am the one having to do most of the work, and when we have to present to the class, she never shows up and I am left having to do the presentation myself. I know pratically nothing about her, because she never talks. This sounds mean, but the only reason that she is part of the friend group is because I felt bad for her, and she's just kind of been following us around for the past few years.\n\nI know there are negative attributes that I may be bringing to our friendship, I've had my own mistakes and flaws. We've had our moments that I have genuinely enjoyed being together, but I have a lot more negative feelings about our relationship than positive. It emotionally exhausts me, and I have no time or patience to deal with them anymore. I don't like how people see me as snobby and rude just for being friends with them.\n\nI ask how I can discontinue our friendship, because I am unsure of how to. Most people tell me just to talk with them about it, but the things that annoy me about them have been going on for so long that it has become somewhat normal in the friend group, and they would just think I was bringing it up to be joking or overly-sensitive. I am in a relatively small high school so I cannot distance myself from them, and they'd just treat me like crap and spread gossip if I did. It exhausts me so much that I am considering changing high schools just to stay away from them. I dislike how I am treated, I dislike how I am the parent of the group, I dislike how much effort I have to put in just to keep this friendship afloat.

I talked with one of my female co workers and expressed concern about him etc. I had talked with my boyfriend about it beforehand and he had jokingly said \"maybe he has a crush on you\" and when I brought this up with my afore mentioned female co worker we both laughed and I thought wrote it off as ridiculous. Fast forward a few days and I get a message on Facebook from him basically saying that he had heard about what I had said to female co worker and stated that the reason he was ignoring me was because I \"didn't do my work anymore and was more interested in talking\" which was a bold move since while I do talk to my fellow coworkers I do still get my job done. So I apologized for dragging him into it and that I didn't want to lose him as a friend. But he still doesnt really talk to anyone at work anymore like he used to.

My mother could not study as a child, even though she loved reading, because her father made her work in the farm. So she kinda overprotected me. On some ways it was good, as she made sure I could go to college, but on the other hand there were so many things that only the world was able to taught me.\n\nDuring my childhood I get used to be lonely, as the \"neighbors\" with more kids to play were 1 or more kilometers away. Then I got into computer science, which makes one really into computers, but distant from people. During this period I also had a toxic relationship (e.g., my girlfriend was very jealous and would make me \\*swear\\* to her that I would not say hi, or even turn my eyes in the direction, of a girl who worked as secretary at the college).\n\nAfter college I moved to a big city and got a nice job. Attended some therapy. After a while I started to realize that I have never understood what was to have a friend. I don't know, other people seemed to have a natural way to reach out and keep things going. I have also not had a girlfriend since college -- it's been 6 years now. Had some affairs, but could not keep consistency.\n\nI am now in really good university, in a developed country, working on grad school, it's been 1 month since I arrived, and I just spent Christmas alone because I could not make friends here yet.\n\nI feel like I can talk to people, my only problems regarding this are when I have to approach, e.g., a co-worker in their desk or a stranger at street. Other than that I am always making people laugh, and I am also very good a public speaking.\n\nBut, I feel I can't make friends. When I think about this, I always remember of my lone childhood, it's like I got used to being alone, but now I can't stand this anymore. I think it is difficult to be consistent, and so it is difficult to \"grow\" relationships.\n\nSo to conclude, my more recent thoughts are in the direction that (1) I realized that I am probably spoiled for being an only child, and (2) I probably must learn to be a better person to have friends. Not sure how to do this though.\n\n(sorry about the messy text -- that's just how some of these things are in my head)\n\nI hope this makes sense, and thank you for reading.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

One (M18) I have known for 14 years, other (F) I have known for 13 years, and the other two I knew for 11 years (M17) and 16 (M18). We're hanging out on daily basis and we always have so much fun, but I can't help the feeling that I'm the odd one out. All of them know so much about each other, they know who likes who, they know about each others problems, they know some secrets, and when they talk about a some things I feel like a stranger. I'm very socially awkward and can't really connect with people because I can't hold any kind of conversation. I feel like that's one of the main problems. At first I was ok with that. I was ok with them not telling me everything because I value their privacy and believe that if someone wants to tell me something they will. But lately I feel like I'm more of a background character for them. Everything was ok until last night when at a birthday party one of them (M18) went out because he wasn't feeling well. I don't know what happened next, but like an hour later when we were leaving the party he looked like he was crying, and the others knew what happened. Again I don't know what happened because every time I asked any of them what happened they would say nothing, everything is ok, don't worry, ect. But I know something bad happened, I have a gut feeling. When we went out two of them (M17 &amp; F18) didn't want to leave the one who was crying. Me and the other guy couldn't stay. Now I feel like they don't trust me because in the past I never gave them any good advice because I don't have a good way with words, but I'm feeling kinda useless to them. They never tell me their problems and they never ask me for help. I'm not the funny one, I'm not a good listener.

I\u2019m an open-minded free spirit who gets giddy upon spotting dogs. \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude0d \nI\u2019m a generally bubbly person well-versed in sarcasm and unintentionally creating Michael-esque situations for myself (#TheOfficeisagreatshow). I know 3 languages and love etymology and playing with words. Definitely helps a flirt with a crude sense of humor. \ud83d\ude09  Heh heh\n\nI live in Brooklyn but I don\u2019t mind making new friends in other boroughs or pen pals or whatever. Bonus points for fellow people passionate about music and potential travel buddies. Every time I\u2019ve planed a trip with my friends, it\u2019s failed so I traveled alone a good amount this year. I want to explore the world with other people who are also serious about traveling and will ACTUALLY do it. Earlier this year, I got really sick and was rushed to the hospital where I was in extreme pain and almost died. That experience changed my perspective on life and opened my eyes. Life is meant to be lived, being depressed about the things you can\u2019t control is a horrible way to spend it. \n\n I\u2019m an old soul who would much rather hang out in person and actually experience life than screen-poke into oblivion. I\u2019m bummed that I haven\u2019t really been able to do any of these things with my seemingly shrinking and increasingly flaky friend group. A good amount of them are getting married or are, with kids, or busy doing their own thing or being consumed by relationships or work, or actually just really flaky to the point of not texting back when asked to confirm plans that we have for that same day. It makes me feel lonely, like a bother, and like I\u2019m not important enough to spend time with, or even respond to. It\u2019s crazy how people who once were interlinked can just grow apart and phase out over time.  \n\nWith 2020 around the corner, I\u2019ve decided to quit letting it negatively effect me and to  instead follow a quote I saw on instagram earlier this week that I\u2019m paraphrasing  - \u201cFriends aren\u2019t made to last forever, friends are meant for different phases of your life. Learn what you learn from that relationship and move on.\u201d\n \nThis is me basically saying, F this phase, the decade is ending! Time for some new phase friends! \ud83d\ude02 \n\nPs.

So the thing is, we have had a discussion the other day cause I told him that I was tired of his criticisms and judgements towards me, and find them mean. He sees himself as \"frank and honest, tell ppl things the way they are exactly\". So in the heated convo I got mad and called him toxic, which I apologised for seconds later by again explaining that I find his judgements and criticisms towards me mean now, compared to 4 years ago whereby I would simply laugh it off, if not along with him. He said that he was just helping me to be my best self, along with me acting all egocentric and ungrateful since my arrival, and how they have been trying hard to make my holidays go well. \nSo to cut short, things have changed since that discussion. We don't talk like before, if not at all.

I have an interest in her and decided to take her out. She didn't have the same interest. I decided that we can just be friends for now. Over time, my interest in her was stepping down. Here is why. We never really do anything, just eat junk food and watch movies. Whenever she's at my place, she would take a nap and would make me order food for her. She would constantly judge my hair, face, and style. She would face time me 3 - 5 times a week and all I see her is doing her own thing. What is the point of face timing, I want my phone back! \n\nI also hated how much excuses shes making. She blamed her stress for making her a jerk and eats tons of junk food.\n\nShe would also try to make me feel bad whenever I wanted to do my own things as I wanted to play golf with my other friends. When I asked her to hang out, she would reject me and said that what she felt when I chose to be with my other friends. Wtf? Why do I need to be guilty of that?\n\nThe biggest red flag happened around a month ago. My aunt was going through the end of life sedation and it was hard on me because she was my favorite aunt. At the same time, it was a week before finals, I had a lot of essays due. I decided to have Alexa over and do HW with me. That time, she was stressed out that she constantly judge my looks. I told her I didn't have time to care about my looks because of assignments and the fact my aunt was passing away. She replied saying that she is more stressed out than me, my aunt does not matter much because she is not my mom. I was furious, I told her I am not competing who's more stressed out. All I wanted was her to give me a break. She blamed her stress for making her a jerk, again.\n\nI cannot stand her righteousness. I am now on winter break and she constantly texted me \"hi.\" I would reply back like half a day later. Her response is \"nvm.\" This happened twice and I am done!

We have been friends since high school and are now in our early 20s. I really love hanging around this person.

She get very fidgety and upset and told me not to do that again because the police would pull me over. The way she said it was just very angry. I told her that I hadn't been sure if it was a 1way or not and made a joke about turning down one in the wrong direction in the past. She huffed and said that \"well, the good thing about this city is they have HUGE signs saying which way the road goes\", which seemed to be implying that i'm dumb and oblivious to that. There was another time where I picked up our trash from having a meal together and went to the trash/recycling bin to toss it. She had offered to do it but I figured there was no issue with me just doing it. She started saying \"no, NO, give it to me\" and kinda ripped it from my hand so she could go over to the place that had the trash/recycle and compost. She started separating the trash and told me it was a city ordinance and that she didnr want to get a ticket because of me, which honestly felt a bit ridiculous. Idk, if it were me I would have just gently reminded her to compost and that would have been that. She just seemed to take the extra step to make me feel stupid and get angry for doing something small.\n\nThere are also a lot of times when she makes small comments about me. Like describing my way of dress as \"sloppy\" or telling me that my music tastes are \"unrefined\". \n\nThere are other things I could go into but I dont know if I want to. I adore my friend, I really do, I just wish she would stop making me feel bad or insecure every single time we're \n\nI guess the advice I'm looking for is just what to do? I dont want to end this friendship, but it's difficult for me to be around somebody that makes me anxious. She gets upset if I bring any of my issues up. I love my friend, but its hard\n\n\nUPDATE: I talked to her about my concerns and told her about how her comments were upsetting me. She was a little but upset at first but seemed to understand and apologized. She said she didnt mean to hurt or upset me with them and that she would be more mindful in the future.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

For the next few weeks after that happened, I was petrified and would start shaking after even hearing anyone's voice coming from my bedroom window. My anxiety that I had before coming to uni got worse and soon after, I got diagnosed with depression from multiple psychiatrists.\n\nThe reason why I'm making a post about this is because, I love a lot of aspects about uni. I really like the UK, I love my flatmates and the friends I've made there, I really enjoy my subject even though it is very demanding. When I'm happy at uni, I'm motivated, I'm excited to learn and meet new people and everything's great. But when my depression and PTSD starts coming back bad, I literally hate my life and can no longer find any happiness in everything that I loved before.\n\nI'm at a point in my life where I wish I could start everything again. I'm honest, very behind with my lectures/tutorials and January exams are coming up in two weeks. Even though they technically don't count because I'm only in first year, the coursework (which is due in around the sane time) does. I'm so disappointed in myself because I really wanted to use this opportunity to really gauge how a uni exam is really like and it's very hard to do that when I haven't done the adequate revision that I would have done if I was normal. I have a disability support plan at university which makes it a bit better because I can get a bit of extra time on the exams and have some extentions to my coursework + am going to start cognitive therapy in Jan when I'm back but I still feel hopeless. \n\nRight now, its 3:25am where I'm at and I'm writing this crying after experiencing one of the worst nightmares I've ever experienced where I thought someone was coming to kill me. I woke up in complete sweat and I almost had another panic attack then in there. Only after I took Xanax and other prescribed medication did I start to regain some sort of composure.\n\nI'm at a point of my life where I feel like I'm in two different worlds. In one, I'm my 'usual self' where I'm super energetic, extroverted and love the things that I normally like to do: partying, hanging with my friends, meeting people, exploring new places to eat etc. In the other world (which is me in this present state), I feel like all I can do is lock myself in my room without seeing people for days at a time. I dont't have an appetite at all. I have recurring nightmares. I always have low energy and feel fatigued even after getting enough sleep the night before. I feel worthless and unmotivated to do anything.\n\nMy flight to the UK is tomorrow night. My exams are in two weeks and I have not been able to do anything revision-wise these 3 months and these last two weeks being back in my home country due to my shit mental health and coming down with a bad stomach flu.\n\nI don't know what to do or how to proceed next. Should I continue to push through this and continue with uni because I love my friends there and my subject and the independence about it or should I start again next September (which I am reluctant to do) ? Please help - would really love someone to talk to right now x", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

So for some background - she got a lottery apartment in the city for 700$ a month and her and her boyfriend decided to take it, but wanted to test it out first so they are still paying rent for there other place. they pay for both places and don't even stay in the city at all. so they pay an extra 700$ a month for no reason.  She had to take a loan out to pay for her rent, because she was fired from her job and is taking classes at a community college. She has to pay for classes too and did not do well in the one class she was taking and now has to re take it. \n\nanyway - I am going on a cruise with my family and we had an open spot. I told her that I know she's broke af right now but if she wants to come on the cruise for 300$ she can come. 300$ for a cruise is so cheap considering it was 1000$ for the room. She said she didn't have the money and can't even afford her rent and that her bf is paying. I said that's fine and that I understood.\n\nSo now I just found out that she bought her boyfriend a 600$ Gucci sweater. 600$ for a SWEATER. I am in disbelief that she wasted that amount of Money on something so insane when she cannot even pay rent. and I cannot beleive her boyfriend accepted that gift.\n\nIm a little offended that she claimed she had no money for the cruise but goes out and blows 600$. If she didn't want to go she could just say that rather then say she can't spend that money.\n\nAnyway - should I confront her or speak to her about this and her spending. I feel like whenever I talk to her about these things it goes in one ear out the other. Is it my business anyway? should I even be feeling a type of way? I know she can spend her money on what she pleases - but I mean. come on.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I mostly listen to rock or metal but I love nearly all genres as I feel like it is good to open your musicality to a wider spectrum.

While I do not strictly play these games, these are my easy go tos, but I also like Garrys Mod, and Modded minecraft quite a lot.\n\nI have been hoping to play some multiplayer games.

Please be 16/17 or above!\nBEWARE: LONG post ahead!\n\n It's been a while since I've posted here. lately i wanted to get to know more people so i started pming ppl who post -out of 5 or so, one single person answered and it was a short conversation before they eventually left. so yeah i just copied my last post and hopefully some people will pm me! (spoiler: i will not ignore you. it'll make me feel guilty af)\n\ntl;dr: hmu if you're a kind genuine friend who'll stay there and will make some effort for us to get to know each other on a personal deep level : )\n\nhi there! i've posted several times here and in other subs and, to be quite fair, i met some nice people. however, what bugs me is the small talk and the emptiness of the conversations. so here you go, I'm looking for people who will, over time, talk with me about interesting topics, personal things, and open up to me. of course, i'm willing to do the same thing to you. so if you're just into small talk or a one-chat-stand, this isn't the best place for you to search!\n\nI'm an 18-year-old male with a big heart, a kind soul and a VERY empathetic spirit (too much empathy becomes bad for your mental health tho). I like to help people and listen to them, trying to solve their problems with them, which is why i'm planning to study psychology and neuroscience: to be able to understand how the human psyche works and how our behavior is affected is something really amazing, and which will hopefully allow more people to lead a better life, with a better understanding of themselves and the possibility to control their mental state (also because i talk a lot irl lol); however i do not guarantee you at all if i'm actually going to be of help, and to be quite honest i would not appreciate too much negativity as it affects me on a deep level-i'll try to comfort if i can though, and, as any friend, I'm a shoulder you can cry on! (quick ps: you can have some rough circumstances and choose to do something about it, but drowning in darkness without even thinking about changing yourcurrent situation is a nuh-uh to me)\n\ni'm into computer science as well, and i'm learning web development on my own for now(stopped since summer bc i gotta focus on my studies-im a senior in hs btw!) to prepare myself for college and (maybe!) working simultaneously with studying, to help me if I'll be studying abroad (for now I'll make my best to earn a scholarship to Germany!), or just to earn some money for myself hehe.\n\napart of that, i love reading books. my favourite book is 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami, but I don't always read those classy highly ranked classics. sometimes I just stick to regular fantasies and \"mainstream\" books, especially in french.\n\nI also write poetry. i like to think of my poetry as beautiful, since it really stems from my soul, and usually when i try i actually take the time and reach out to my feelings, in order to convey them through writing, which really turns oit beautiful once it's embroided with pieces of your soul. I've tried writing when I'm not in the 'mood', and I'm not quite happy with these ones.\n\nI didn't use to watch movies a lot, but starting the end of my junior school year i started watching much more. basically they're all animated movies, but i've seen some regular ones too. my best movie is \"spirited away\", and i also loved \"your name\". \"grave of the fireflies\" turned the handle to the faucet in my eyes lol.\n\ni like watching anime as well, my favourite is \"mahou shoujo madoka magica\" (seriously not your typical \"magically happy yay\" anime, nope, it's got a fair amount of symbolism and thought provoking questions, alongside an amazing kind of dark plot showcasing the price one yas to pay to make their dearest wish come true. i loved mirai nikki too, and \"from the new world\" too. \"a place further than the universe/ sora yori mo tooi basho\" has to be my second favourite anime, very close to madoka. it's AMAZING and so cool. do NOT get me started on Violet Everfarden. a masterpiece. episode 10 got me crying non stop at the end too. that. anime. is. perfect. I've seen boku no heri academia too and it's amazing!!\n\ni also like watching netflix series. for now, i've seen dark, 13 reasons why, reign (loved it), dynasty (loved it too but we have lizgillies to thank for that), and what/if. i am not a series expert but i would like to watch more in the future : )\n\nalright, i think this is going to be the last thing in my interests ahahah. my taste in music is very eclectic. i can go from cool, chill relaxing tracks ([you should seriously listen to this, you won't regret it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl8a9b76GMg)) to lofi hiphop tracks (they're not really the hiphop genre. just some really amazing beats. [listen to this, and you'll understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xyj0Mq-YdUY)), to my favourite artists, [lana del rey (she. is. amazing.) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY2LUmLw_DQ), [a m a z i n g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQlbnqcAhPE). and [s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJJT00wqlOo) [u](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhJtTIDJeCQ) [f](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WTt69YO2VI) [j](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZBCogVtano) [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDgR3FNlsUM) [n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmL-UGqoWbU) stevens (one song for each letter bc his songs are amazing), to hardcore (?) songs like halsey's [nightmare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_dqfcvTZik), and other [halsey songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W2dG3fcdks). a redditor once recommended me some german rap songs (by FARD) and i really liked them too! (told you I'm open to recommendations heheh.)\n\noops, seems like i forgot another thing (hehehe). i also love learning languages. i'm fluent in english, french and arabic, and am currently learning german (i'd love to practise it w/someone!). i've also studied spanish for 3 years but forgot a lot of it, especially the vocabulary, but am seriously considering refreshing it as soon as this year is over, or after I'm totally fluent in german.\n\nobviously i love gaming too however my gaming choices are not that popular lol. my favourite game of all time is an mmorpg called dragon nest. it. is. amazing. I've played elsword too for a fair amount of my childhood, many of aeria games, flyff, and this summer i played kurtzpel and spellbreak and i loved kurtzpel a lot, spellbreak not so much bc my pc's not thaaaat amazing so it lagged a bit. for the offline games i played the naruto ultimate ninja storm series starting 3, and code vein two weeks ago which was a massive beauty. all of theseon pc btw.\n\nneedless to say i love exploring different cultures and mindsets. enlighten me with your different way of thinking! as you might have noticed I'm not really into mainstreams and the stuff everyone's fond of, but with boku no hero (the anime) i realised not all mainstream stuff is bad and so i wouls absolutely love to try out the stuff that you like even if it's quite popular, as long as it's not shallow :)\n\nas crazy as it seems, there are still other stuff i haven't mentioned. for the sake of my amazing personality, I'd like yo mention that I'm an ENFP if that matters to you, a.k.a the best personality on the MBTI test, and i'll leave the rest to the actual convo lol. if youre not interested tho, have a great day \u2661\n\nwhat i'm looking for is a kind, nice, genuine friend who's planning to become somewhat of close pals. let's get to know each other's lives, be there for each other, meet up someday (don't be a serial killer tho) and share lots of stuff! also please try to put in some effort in the conversation; i see a lot of people complaining about people ghosting them, but most people i've talked to are too dry it seems like they don't want to talk to me, so yeah, guess you will be ghosted if you're not interested enough lol.\n\nthank you for reading this long. hit me up even if we don't share many things. see you in my dms!\n\n\\---&gt; [oops forgot to share some other stuff in this already very long post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smn0HOvwoZ8). and the fact that i'm very interested in self-development and becoming a better person. needless to say that i'm very talkative =) and another edit: i forgot [this one too which is amazing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3JGxj2rvAs) we can preferably chat on discord, but we can stick to redditchat for now, the less welcomed option.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I\u2019ve been so focused on me that stuff doesn\u2019t affect me, I even started touching my wedding savings account and got a new tv. I plan to save it for school though.

Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of option, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person. \n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers). \n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values). \n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

Well basically what happened was, a few weeks back I got the idea in my head that E was flirting with me, due to using kiss emotes, I always tell her that she looks great when she wears her leather jacket and boots, for Halloween she was wearing blind contact lens, basically I have very poor eyesight, she was going to come in to college and wear it as a joke, I found this funny and was really looking forward to it but sadly she lost them, so   I said to her \"that's fine, I would of been fine with the  leather jacket and boots but I can take what I can get\" she sent me \" maybe next time\" with a kiss emoji, this confused me because I've never had someone send me something like that and in my view, friends don't normally send messages like that. so I asked 5 people and they all said \"she's flirting with you\" so to make my final decision if I should drop the situation or confront E about it, so I sent C a text, asking her advice and I also mentioned in this text  \"Please don't tell E, I don't want to make it awkward\" C told me she wasn't flirting with me, it's just her being friendly and I should drop it, so I've dropped the situation and haven't thought about it since (nearly 2 months)  till yesterday. Me, C, E and our other friend P went for food in a restaurant,  E and me was the only ones at the table who wasn't wearing glasses, so I made a joke saying \"lol I should go and get my glasses, so E would be out numbered\" then P says \"yeah you and E are the only ones here who's not wearing glasses, maybe you should start dating\" after she said that with a certain tone in her voice and with a smirk  she had  on a face, C laughter too, so now the atmosphere has changed, E looks uncomfortable, I just could sense that E found out that I thought she was flirting with me, it made the rest of the dinner awkward, I felt like C and P were laughing at me. so after the dinner, we all part ways, C texts me saying \" are you okay?, you didn\u2019t seem yourself like you were upset or angry\" I responded with \"if I'm being honest if you I seem upset or angry because I sensed a vibe that you've told E and P about me thinking E  was flirting with me, I could be wrong but after the questions P was asking,  it seems  the atmosphere changed kinda like she knew something and was making a joke about it and I felt like I was being laughed at\" her excuse for E finding out was, when I sent C the message, asking about advice if E was flirting with me or not, was  E was with C  when I sent the message, turns out they was hanging out together in Es car,  well in my view I don't see how that's an excuse, you still had the choice, to not read the message out loud, she didn't need to know what the message said, so I thought to myself \"if E was in the car when I sent C the message, how does P know, she was in Ireland during this situation\" I know for a fact P knows, so the only conclusion I can think of is, C texted P about it, so the excuse of \"E was in the car\" is just a poor excuse (E's car is very old, it didn't read the text by accident, I know for a fact E wouldn't go on Cs phone and read her texts) \n\nI don't know what to do, I don't know if  I should confront C, I'm annoyed E found out, because now I know why for the last few weeks E has been distant towards me. I 'm annoyed E knows but what I'm more annoyed at is, I told C not to tell E or anyone, so that just goes to show my trust was misplaced and she did'nt care about my privacy, please people of reditt, I need your advice, what's your take on the whole thing and what should I so ? \n\nI'm sorry for the message to be so long, I didn't mean to rant, I'm just really annoyed and needed advice, am I in the wrong ?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Although i dislike him, i just wanted my friend\u2019s happiness so i advised him, listened to him talking 24/7 about him during a whole month.. i\u2019ve basically pushed him into the guy\u2019s arms.\n\nThe problem is : since the guy is his boyfriend, he doesn\u2019t really pay attention to me anymore, or not as much as he used to.\nFor example, for my birthday he preferred spending a night with him than party with me and it honestly killed me ! Since then, even though we still see and spend time with each other in highschool, we don\u2019t hang out like we used to because he spends his weekends with his boyfriend ! \nI know i sound selfish saying this because i feel like i should be happier for my friend to finally be comfortable with someone he loves (which i am!) but i also feel abandoned on the other hand. \n\nMy other friend who i really count on has also disappointed me, she keeps saying that i sound selfish and self-centered on everything but when i asked other \u00ab\u00a0friends\u00a0\u00bb, they told me it wasn\u2019t true ! \nI have a medical history (i was born with gender dysphoria in the wrong body and was diagnosed at 14 so i started my transition treatment at only 14) and she told me that i should keep it hidden to my potential partners because i would most likely never be accepted with my past as who i am ! \nAlthough it may sound kinda true ou most likely to be true, it really hurt me because i expected her to be more gentle and support me to be my real self with guys i\u2019m dating because at the end of the day i\u2019m just a simple woman and after all the suffering and bullying i went through, i deserve it ! \nToday she also hung out with Marius, they asked me to come with them on a group chat but i didn\u2019t answer so they told me they assumed i didn\u2019t want to. I think it sounds crazy because they know how i love them and how i would always respond whether it would be a positive or negative response. \nEven though i didn\u2019t answer, they could have asked me in private just to be sure i didn\u2019t want to come but they haven\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if i\u2019m too paranoid about the situation or not but i feel like they just \u00ab\u00a0asked\u00a0\u00bb me for their conscience and not because they wanted me to come, otherwise they would have made sure of my answer.\n\nLately, i\u2019ve been feeling like i\u2019m disappointed by every person i fully trust, i don\u2019t know what to think but i also feel like i can\u2019t believe anyone because I will always end up sad about the situation. Please give me your advice on the situation, I don\u2019t know what to think and I\u2019ve been in a really bad mindset and mood these past days \n\nP.S : i talked to Marius about how I felt, he seemed to understand but nothing changed so he visibly didn\u2019t !", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She turned out to only contact me in order to ask if my brother was single and if she could go out with him. She claimed to have feelings for him despite knowing hardly anything about him other than how much money I've spent on him. \n\nI told her no, but she can be pretty stubborn about guys she likes even getting angry when I told her I liked the president of the club I was in (she only saw him walk by a few times never even spoke to him before). I don't want to be mean to her, but I want her to stay away from my brother. Sorry for how long this is.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I've always been the friend who prefers to stay home (this will come into play later), it's just my thing, I find it very comforting and I like. I think I have a healthy relationship with my friends, we hang out from time to time and have a few laughs. I'am always that one person in the group who doesn't talk that much but they don't really seem to care. They invite me to most of the things they do, and I almost always accept it.   \nThe think that has been bothering me is: They went on a trip for the New Year and I was the only one who wasn't invited, like the only one, of all 13 people in the group I was the one who got left out. I only realized they where going to travel because the mother of one of them told me by accident. When I said that i wasn't going she replied:\"That is strange , because there is still room in the beach house\".   \nWe traveled together to this very same place before too, and I loved it, \"Maybe I got left out because they thought it wouldn't be my thing, since I don't like to party all that much and because I like to stay home\", I thought at first, but there is another person just like me in the group. I just feel sad now that I was the only who got left out. I don't know if I'am overthinking this too much but what do you guys think? Am I at my own fault for passing the impression of wanting  ti stay home?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

They grew apart and I was more introverted and a little shy/awkward. Some I backed away from purposely due to their backstabbing and toxic behaviors. \n\nI have had trouble making long lasting friendships since then. I have made friends on and off for the past 15 years but it seems like I always put more effort into friendships than they do in return and I have sometimes attracted a couple of users/toxic people too because I used to be a people pleaser but I have successfully ended that toxic cycle within myself...(thank goodness for psychology training!) \n\nI'm happily married and have a 7 year old boy who I know I will spend my birthday with along with my parents and it'll be great but sometimes I can't help but be a little sad that I can't plan a trip to a favorite restaurant with not just my family but with friends as well. \ud83d\ude22 \n\nIt sucks because I have this SIL who has a birthday 10 days after mine and every year she has not only her SO and family but the friends who show up grows larger every year. I do love my SIL but I guess I'm just a little envious at the vast amount of friends she has and I don't have any close friend other than my spouse. SIL has dropped 2-3 best friends since I've been with her brother but literally picked up a new one the next day and I guess I'm lucky to just to even be able to talk boring weather or small talk with a stranger at the market or an acquaintance..\ud83d\ude44 It doesn't help that I do think she rubs her BFF life in just a little bit since we used to have a rocky relationship in the beginning, no thanks to a jealous MIL.\n\nI'm still social media friends with some of my old friend group from highschool but that's it as I stated we grew apart and some were toxic and immature (2-3 still are to this day) but it hurts that even they have big birthday bashes with family/spouses/friends, etc! Not even just birthdays, holidays can be depressing for me too when I open social media and literally everyone seems to be BFFs or have a massive friend group with someone. \n\nI love my family but sometimes I just wished I had a couple of meaningful friendships with some girls to hang out with and do things with. \n\nThanks for letting me vent! I've been lurking a while just trying to gather my thoughts about this particular problem that depresses me. \n\nI feel like I can't really talk about this sort of thing on social media because I feel ashamed not having a couple of close friends and I'm about to turn 34. It may be morbid to think about but sometimes I imagine my future funeral only having like 2-3 people there if even that and if it was more than that it would be fake cause the acquaintances and past friends I've had don't make me feel loved, wanted, or even missed. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI've always been the one to have to initiate hanging out and I've always been the one to help give advice or be a helper/do a favor type but when the shoe is on the other foot...crickets.

And so, if you\u2019re intrigued, read on!\n\nA few more things about me\u2026 I\u2019m 26 and my biggest passion is writing! I spend most of my days writing away \u2013 if you\u2019re curious about any of my projects, I\u2019d love to talk about them! I also write a lot of poetry too, but I\u2019m too shy to share any of those just yet! I also watch a lot of anime and read a lot of manga \u2013 I\u2019ve made it my mission to finish the entirety of the Sailor Moon manga, and I\u2019m halfway there!!! I play games, too \u2013 I\u2019m playing Fire Emblem: Three Houses at the moment. And I\u2019m looking forward to the new Animal Crossing in a few months!!\n\nI also read a TON, and I often read more than one book at a time. I\u2019m currently reading Ninth House, The Starless Sea, and Queen of Nothing. Phew!\n\nI\u2019ve been dreaming about being able to do stuff like the following with friends:\n\n* If you\u2019re a **bookworm** like me, let\u2019s have buddy reads together! We can pick a book and read it at the same time and talk about it together \u2013 like a mini book club, just for us!\n* If you like **anime**, let\u2019s do the same for an anime \u2013 or a **manga**! We\u2019ll promise to watch an episode a week and then talk/rant/fangirl/etc about it together \u2013 like an anime/manga club\u2026? (Is that a thing? LOL)\n* If you like **video games**, we could find one to play together! I just bought a Switch and bought Stardew Valley for it\u2026 I played a lot of Stardew on PC, but I\u2019d love to find folks to play together on Switch. I\u2019ve never played the multiplayer yet though, so go easy on me!!!\n* If you **write**, let\u2019s be our own little beta readers! We\u2019ll promise not to go easy on each other, but still make reviewing each other\u2019s work fun &lt;3 Or, let\u2019s co-write a story together!!\n\nAnd so on! It doesn't have to be any of these things exactly, but that's just an example. I\u2019d love to make a real connection. &lt;3  I don\u2019t want to just exchange messages over Discord \u2013 I want to be able to **do** stuff together \u2013 where we can have fun and goof off!\n\nSo, if any of the following interests you, please send me a message! And knock on the witch\u2019s door, she\u2019ll invite you inside for some tea and scones and pleasant company\u2026\n\nEDIT: Haha, when you send a message, please tell me about yourself!

And as much as I love to talk about common interests and do things like share music and film recommendations and things like that, I don't think that is as important when it comes to finding real friendships as finding someone with a similar outlook on life. Maybe it's not something you think about often, but do you think that life is enjoyable and is worth living? I do and I hope you do too. Existentialism is the way to go \ud83d\ude42 So please feel free to DM me here or we can use discord. And have a beautiful day \n\nThank you for reading!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Okay so maybe not absolutely anyone, but as long as you\u2019re a decent person, I\u2019m happy to talk)\n\nI like music, my tastes range from Rise Against, to Leonard Cohen, to my favourite, Childish Gambino.\n\nI read comics, I used to love Marvel, but the past few years I\u2019ve transitioned into DC. I read books, whether it be a crime thriller, a book that will fuck me up emotionally (I\u2019m looking at you Green Mile) or a history book. Ummmm what else? Recipes, sometimes. I know how to cook a mean apple pie.\n\nI love going for hikes, I live in the mountains so it is literally 5 minutes to the nearest trail.\n\nI also love movies, I love focusing on the cinematography in movies. Roger Deakins and Emmanuel Lubezki have helped make some of the most gorgeous movies.\n\nUm yeah. I don\u2019t know if you read this far, but if any of this interests you feel free to pm me.

Please. The only time you talk is if YOU call him or her.\n\nSo you decide to try and find out if everything is alright with this \"friend\" and guess what. It is! It's just that you don't seem to fit into their life anymore.\n\nSo what do you do when it seems that you're in a friendship all by yourself? I'll TELL you what you do. You need to back off to see just how long your \"friend\" takes to show YOU that they still value your friendship, and if he or she does not reach out for you at least \"sometime\" then acknowledge your own self-love, pride, dignity and move on. Does it suck in terms of the way they treat you out of what seems to be thin air. Well of course it does, and sometimes we have a hard time accepting the fact that we've been dumped for whatever reason when we like people and want or expect them to like or love us back, but people and things change. It could be a new significant other; personal issues they can't bring themselves to share just yet; a work scheduled that only leaves room for people that are higher on that person's priority list than you... or maybe they feel you're clingy or don't fit in with their other friends. Shit who knows exactly why some people change unless they come out and tell us... and most are too fake, polite or afraid to be honest about things like this, so they pretty much just fade into the mist so they won't have to explain themselves.  My advice... just let go, if they come back fine, but if they don't, then you probably didn't lose anything anyway except someone who was only in your life for a season... and when season change, you must change as well.\n\nPeace", "subreddit": "friendship"}

That way I can quickly check who has even bothered to read it this far. Also, I would really appreciate a small intro about who you are and why you decided to message.\n\nI need to also mention that I am experiencing panic attacks sometimes and that makes it hard for me to go out somewhere, so I am not willing to meet people I don\u2019t know well.

He found my instagram, which I thought was a little weird since we've never talked. Like I didnt even think he knew my name before this, as it was a really big class. But I was bored and he seemed nice so I responded to his texts.\n \nWe would talk over text and the phone becuase he didn't go to my school anymore and It was nice at first. But then after like a couple months he started asking me to talk to him every day over the phone. And usually that would be fine by me, but our phone calls were usually pretty long and I have two jobs and school to deal with. I told him I might not be able to and he said it was fine. \n\nThe next day after work I can see he was blowing up my phone, asking why I didn't call, why I'm not reading his messages. I call him and tell I had work and I told him before the day before. He calms down and apologizes and we change subject. \n\nThis happens several more times, and the only reason at that point I still talked to him was because I  was in a rough patch with my other friends and he would listen to me. But at this point I needed a break. I told him we should stop talking and he puts all of his cards on the table. He tells me about his depression and how he has no friends and is considering hurting himself and that if I leave he wouldn't have anyone to talk his feelings out. I tell him that he should seek out professional help and that I'm in no way trained to help with that. He again says no and keeps telling me that I'm the only thing keeping him alive. He keeps this up for about five minutes and I just hang up. \n\nI feel awful about it now because he was telling me about how he has no one to talk to and that he was thinking about some pretty bad stuff. I even muted his texts and ignore them. I know that depression is a big deal and I dont want to hurt him by shutting him out, but I've had a friend that died at their own hand once and I can't go through that again.

I tend to listen way more than I speak, but I am an open-book when interest is showed in me! \n\nMy hobbies include gaming (PC, Switch, PS4), baking, reading books, watching YouTube/Twitch/movies, gardening, laughing at dumb memes, hanging with my dogs, listening to music, reading tarot cards, astrology stuff, collecting plushies/figurines, and probably some other things I'm forgetting. I have a toe dipped into a ton of things when it comes to things that I enjoy doing. That's definitely the little Gemini inside of me.\n\nSome of my favourite things are Overwatch (I watch League pretty religiously), Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne, Mother 3, Fire Emblem, the smell of lavender, my purple witch cat Build-A-Bear, hydrangea, Gravity Falls, BoJack Horseman, stargazing, the moon (both the tarot card and the actual moon), Oyasumi Punpun, moonstones, cows, bears, and forests at dusk!\n\nYeah!

What are your guys thought?", "author": "MelAm23", "self_text": " \n\nAbout 4 years ago I left for basic training, she begged me not go. I'm always doing things for everyone else this is something I needed to do for me. She said she'd be waiting for me when I got back. Depression hit her when I left because I was all she had, but she chose that and I've never seen her happier, and I had never been happier I finally felt comfortable and loved the time we had spent together. I knew she were sad and I couldn't do anything being in a completely different state with no communication to anyone except letters every week (if lucky). When I got back she replaced me because it was too much to handle, but I had held out for the thought of going back to see my best friend the whole time I was gone because she's the only person I'm 100% comfortable around.\n\nEver since I've been back I find excuses to go places I know she'll be, basketball games, social events, I event went to church once (for someone else) but I knew she'd be there. She don't text me and when she does it's dry but she know I'm going to give her attention because I miss her. I was at a point where I finally accepted what has happened and stopped talking to her. But of course she had to text me out of the blue because she needed someone to talk to, so what did I do? I waited a few minutes to not seem eager and texted back happy to help her. When I'm done listening and she's done venting she goes back to being dry.\n\nI just went to go see my mom at work and there she was, I didn't even see her in there but she saw me, a mile away. She jumped out of the aisle and screamed \"hi!\" with her eyes lit up like they always are when she see me. I was anxious so said hey and kept moving but I noticed she was with her. I don't know and I will never know why she chooses her, she doesn't listen to her problems, she doesn't \"come to her rescue\" every time she needs something, she doesn't know her. During a basketball game last year she started getting anxious so I knew she'd run to the bathroom because when she gets worked up like that she pukes, so what did I do, I ran after her and calmed her down. Would she do that for her if it happened now? The answer is no because she doesn't understand her anxiety.\u00a0\n\nShe acts like she doesn't need me and texts me dry but if I don't pay attention to her she randomly texts or snaps me. Why? When I see her (whether I know I'll run into her or not) her eyes still light up and she still gets the biggest smile on her face. Or if she hears my voice I catch her looking for me, if I don't acknowledge her she makes it a point to be heard. She screams my name or \"bumps\" into me. So why does she act like she doesn't need me or want me, whatever facade she's giving off that day.\u00a0Why can't we just go back to normal she know I didn't leave to hurt her, but she keeps parading around with people to hurt me. It doesn't hurt, just confuses the hell out of me.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Later on she gets all mad at me for planning what we could do since she doesn\u2019t have as much money so she just wants to go to the park or something simple. Another day passes and we all decide to do her idea and just go to the park however, she doesn\u2019t want to do that anymore and gets really angry at us. She tells us (all in caps) to just plan it without us and that she is not going. One of the other boys says he cannot go for certain reasons which is okay.\n\nSo now it\u2019s just me, my best friend, my boyfriend and one of the other boys. We go on the bus to an arcade and then go to a food place to eat afterwards.

She says, \u201cHave you guys made another group chat without me?\u201d\nWe did in fact make another group chat but isn\u2019t that what she wanted?

{"post_id": "ei1dly", "created_utc": 1577789254, "title": "big fight with best friend. is there anything i can do?", "author": "thatsmybodygaurd", "self_text": "Me and my best friend have been friends for 12 years now. We had some ups and downs, but for past 2 years it's been going good. Sorry for the long post but it's hard for me as I don't know what really went down, also we've been friends for such a long time.\n\nSo let me state a few facts to paint a picture for you\n\n1. Few months ago my friend moved out (suddenly) to a different city, which is about 5h drive away for me. She moved out because of a guy that I warned her about, he was a walking red flag. Long story short he played her and she got her heart broken so she decided to move out. \n2. She really changed these past few months. And it's not for good. She would only talk about herself (her new job or this guy). I was going through some shit (my grandma died, other family issues, love stuff) and she would always refer to her issues only, unless I brought up mine or stopped talking to her. She suddenly got this weird(?) sense of like...self-worth? Like I'd say something and she would blow up saying \"don't you dare talk to me like that!\" \n3. We loosely talked about spending NYE together but it never got serious. Reason being she does work on NYE and finishes at around 11pm. I would have to drive there and pay for gas and highway fees which would cost me more than I can spend right now. And leave next day cause she also works the next day. So I thought it just not a good idea. And thought about visiting her on a different day. Mind you, she was in my city before Xmas and I offered a meeting but she declined. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yesterday we talked through the phone (which is rare now) and she asked about the NYE. I said that I'm sorry but I'm not coming since she works etc. Well, she got mad. She started yelling at me saying those are stupid excuses. And started pushing for a \"real reason\"(?). She said stuff like \"you're isolating yourself from me, you have some kind of problem, you need time alone or what? you don't care about me, if you would care you would come to spend NYE with me, now i'm gonna be alone\". at this point  I asked if she's really going to be alone, she said no, her roommate and roommate's boyfriend will be at home also. well...okay. So she continued to say how stupid my excuses are and that it is not fair etc. And why I don't wanna come, why why why. I finally said \"okay, i just don't feel like it, can you drop it? you yell at me like we're couple or something\". She got mad again, saying how this is exactly what this guy used to say to her and that I can't speak like that. Then she started saying that I just don't care anymore cause last month I didn't talk to her for 2 weeks. (pause here - i did get some time away from her because i was tired of her talking about this guy all the time, every topic we started would drift away to him. at this point he left her already, but she still couldn't deal with it. she did even hire a hacker to get into his fb...luckily the hacker scammed her so it didn't work out). So again i explained why i wasn't talking to her and said it is really not related and why is she bringing that up? \n\nSo she did say some more stuff. The conversation finished on her saying \"if you wanna talk later, call me, i'll pick up or call you back, cause you know people call back\" i just said bye.\n\nI was feeling really bad after this. I honestly felt like i did a terrible thing, i felt guilty. I started to think about it all and it occurred to me that this is not the first time something like this happens. Cause last month, the time when i wasn't talking to her, she did the same thing. She yelled, said that it is unfair, that i'm being egoistic, i'm not a real friend etc. And  she would finish with almost the same sentence \"call me when you're cool down and ready to talk\". Before this situation there were many others. After my grandmother passed away, any time i'd call her out on some bullshit she would say \"you're blowing up because you still haven't dealt with that emotions and you're just taking it all out on me\". Like what? and i really started to put all the puzzles together. I felt so bad that I decided to sent her a message. \n\nIn my message i said once again that i'm sorry for the NYE stuff and it was not my intention to hurt her. I also brought up that i can't no longer treat her behavior as a norm. I feel like it's really her trying to play with my emotions to get her way and i'm not gonna let her manipulate me. I asked what's her goal in all that and why is she always blaming me and saying that this is all because I have some psychological issues and that's why our friendship is going bad. I said that the reason why I was distancing myself from her is exactly her behavior. And i'm just saying that cause i hope she can finally understand that it is not normal. She would always say that we are friends so we fight. \n\nHer response was...not what i expected or maybe exactly what i expected. She said that if i have a problem i can always talk to her. And that she was just really hurt about me not coming to spend NYE with her. (So it's all she got from my message). \n\nAt this point i just said that it is not what i meant. She said that if I feel a need to yell at her and make her feel bad (whaaaaat?!?!?!) that's okay. and maybe i just should do what i need to do to be happy. and a lot of passive aggressive stuff was said like \"if you hate me so much...\"\"if you're so tired of me...\"etc\n\nI explained once again, calmly, what i meant and that i care for our friendship but this is just insane. I also mentioned that i'm not the first person that brings up that issue with her and it's really not something that i just imagined. \n\nHer answer was that she doesn't feel like she's being manipulative. She just says what she sees and she demands people playing it fair with her. and that maybe she shouldn't say that but honestly she's not hurt by the fact that i'm not coming. and she wishes me happy new year. \n\nI didn't respond anymore cause how do you respond to that? My thing is I wasn't trying to put blame on her or anything like that. Yes our friendship did become little bit distant but it was because of behavior like that. I have different friends and none of them acts this way. Also i never really did anything to hurt her, even this year i was trying to be supportive...until i couldn't be no more. I feel like she's just emotionally and psychologically draining. I don't want our friendship to end but what else can I do? I honestly do feel that she has some kind of an issue but how can I fix that? She did used to go to psychotherapy and the therapist told her that most of her problems are caused by her being provocative and manipulative, especially with men. She dropped that therapist shortly after...\n\nSorry for the long post guys but honestly I never expected her to act like that towards me. I guess I was just treating it as a norm this past few months cause I didn't want this to end. I was hoping that my message to her would kind of make her think about it, talk about it etc. but it didn't really work out. \n\nHappy new year guys!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

It is currently 19:45 in the UK and, as a result, I have another 4 hours and 15 minutes to kill before I have I inevitably see the hands of Big Ben strike 12:00 through my television screen followed by an absolute bombardment of fireworks all around which will scare the ever-living shit out of my poor innocent dog! Minor tangent aside... I am attempting to overcome my boredom until then by partaking in conversations with random people on the Internet such as yourself! Seriously though, the reason as to why I am making this post is because I want to connect with a different people (preferably within my age-range) because this will, hopefully, result in the creation of some genuine friendships.\n\nBy this point in the post, it is highly likely that you are currently asking yourself the question of \"Should I even bother talking to this guy?\" Well my potential future friend, continue delving deeper into this absolute mess of a post and I almost certain that you will discover the answer of which you seek.\n\nYou can probably already tell by the sheer size of this lengthy-ass post that I absolutely love writing and, as a result, I can quite very easily hold a written conversation with you as long as I have more to work with than the all-to-common one-word answer. In regards to talking verbally, I am quite a shy and introverted individual and so, even though I am not completely opposed to using voice chat to communicate, I would much prefer it if I got to know you better first. Another thing that you may have noticed by now is that being serious really isn't my forte... I much prefer to just say whatever random shit comes to my mind genuinely attempt to have a fun time when talking to people. OH! I should also note that I recently went to see a doctor who confirmed that I am 99.9% still alive and definitely not a ghost. Fortunately for you, this small detail means that it is pretty much guaranteed that I will not ghost you by trying my best to respond to all of your messages! Isn't that great news?!?\n\nHopefully, the description provided so far has successfully tickled your pickle and convinced you to send me a PM or contact me through direct chat but, if not, here are some of my hobbies and interests for some extra persuasion:\n\nVideo Games - Despite absolutely loving video games, I honestly never take seriously anymore because I have come to the depressing realisation that I am absolutely shit at just about every game that I have ever played. With this information in mind, be sure to let me know if you ever feel the need to lose to a bunch of competitive games or if you just want to mess around on some more chilled out games.\n\nMusicals &amp; Animation - I love Broadway musicals and I love animation. It really is as simple as that. Seriously though, I absolutely adore musicals and animated shows/movies and I can't resist the urge to talk about them whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nMemes- Just getting this out there, I have an endless supply of memes readily available at all times. Trust me people, if you ever need your daily dose of memes... I am your guy.\n\nTravelling - Travelling around this country and other countries is something that I absolutely love doing. Unfortunately, I hardly get to experience travelling anymore due to the fact that I am a university student which constantly leaves me completely deprived of both time and money.\n\nWalking/Hiking - Plain and simple. Even though many of you might find this to be extremely bland and boring, putting in my headphones and taking in the atmosphere whilst on a long walk is something that I absolutely adore.\n\nWell, you did it internet stranger, you successfully made it to the end of my post. In all honesty, I truly didn't expect to see anybody make it this far. Seriously though, how have you managed to read the entirety of my boring post without falling asleep? That is truly astonishing. Unfortunately, this is now the definitive end of my post but, if you still want to listen to me ramble on and learn more about me instead of actually enjoying New Years eve for some unexplained reason, don't hesitate to drop me a PM or direct chat.

Any Advice is Appreciated", "author": "throwawayacount11131", "self_text": "I used to be friends with someone who I met online. We got along well and were pretty close. We talked almost everyday even though they lived miles and miles away. Whether it was calling or texting, we made it happen. The friendship fell apart, though, because it was tiring to keep it stable due to the physical distance between us. It didn't help that we were both dealing with our own issues. I hate to say it, but he became quite a burden to me without meaning to. I couldn't deal with it, so I made a decision I regret to this day. I ghosted him. There was no explanation given, no feedback said, nothing. For some reason I thought that would be the least painful option. I figured we'd both move on in time. \n\nThis person is still very important to me, and I feel awful about what I did. Even to this day, he still sometimes texts my number or DMs me on Instagram, hoping that I respond. He hasn't forgotten that I basically abandoned him for selfish reasons. I know we both want closure, I'm just not sure how to give it to him. That, and I am some sort of a coward. \n\nIt has been almost over a year since I have made any sort of contact with this person. I still have his number, Instagram, and even his address. I could reach out if I wanted to. The weight of what I did to one of my closest friends at the time is constantly eating at me. The whole ordeal was left unsolved and messy. I would like to start 2020 with no regrets. I want to be a better person and friend. Because of this, I realized it was probably time to give him  (and me) closure. He deserves it. \n\nThe thing is, I'm not sure how. I have no idea how to apologize or explain what was going through my mind all those months ago. All I know is that it's necessary to do. Any advice regarding how to properly apologize, rebuild a friendship, or move on would be greatly appreciated. Should I even reach out at all?

But then again I'm not really interested in partying like my roommates are off to.\n\nI do have a few friends from school but nothing like a super tight best friend, but even with them I'm still more or less awkward and not really talking about the stuff that I find most intriguing. Do you know what I'm saying? I'm generally really bad like bad bad at starting conversations/small talk so I thought I might have better luck with getting straight to the point online.\n\nI'd like to talk about the things that really move you or me intellectually and also emotionally(I might not be the best person for emotional advice though). For me that would be just general aim in life, as in the foundation of big and small personal decisions up to the formation of political views. Then consciousness from a biological and philosophical point of view. Other than that I have a fear of sleep and unconsciousness which troubles me greatly.\n\nAs for hobbies I mostly cook a lot, mostly Asian by coincidence, and try other crafty stuff like pottery, gardening, bread making, programming but haven't dove to deep into any of those yet. Then I spend endless hours on the Internet delving into 'niche' subjects like looking at cool Japanese pottery, reading chocolate reviews, discovering new kinks on NSFW411, you know how it goes. I watch a lot series and liked stuff like the Offive, the Last Kingdom, early Game of Thrones and a lot of cultured anime stuff(Evangelion Nr.1!).\n\nSee you around, maybe.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Well I was wrong. \nI haven't had the best history on Reddit but I'm trying to do better this year.\nSo here's a bit about me.\n\nI'm from Northern Virginia.  looking for a kindred spirit. I'd like a best friend I can call family. I'm nerdy and down to earth. I am shy, but also sweet when you get to know me,  I'm  interested in a Companion- only relationship. I don't like to get philosophical unless I am comfortable with the person I'm talking to, so please don't ask anything deep and layered right off the bat! I like to make a slow bond and get to know who I'm talking to. I don't care about age, looks, or sexual preference as long as you're over 18 but i 'd prefer someone under 50.\n\n\nI'm a nerd-born and raised on video games as well as anime and manga. I prefer to spend free time binging Dragon Ball Z, The Walking Dead, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Dr.Who  Pokemon, or Harry Potter (I'm a Hufflepuff btw). Of course, I also enjoy a good book. Along with some Writing and Role-playing from time to time.\nIf video games are more your style, I can rock RPGs alongside you. I love building massive settlements in games like Ark Survival Evolved, Conan Exiles,  And Minecraft. And I'd love for someone to kick my butt in Fighting games like Mortal Kombat. I own a PS4 btw  And due to its increase in popularity I'm slowly getting out of Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n\nI'm not a huge sports fan but I do enjoy Wrestling, Mostly NJPW, Lucha Underground, AEW and Some WWE. And follow it quite religiously. \n    I also don't drink or smoke but I am 420 friendly and hopefully my potential new friend is the same. My religious Views are none but I'm trying to become a Buddhist. I know politics is important to some people but I'm neither a republican or a democrat \n\n\nI hope you aren't completely turned away yet! I like people who are clean kept. I also want someone who's artsy or creative. I like gamer types as well as somebody who values dependability, loyalty, and open mindedness just like me. I want someone trustworthy, non judgemental, selfless, honest, and encouraging. Someone who is giving, merciful, supportive, positive, empathetic, generous, and steadfast. A good listener who is self confident and has a great sense of humor. And, of course, Fun.  I can't promise You dank memes but I can show you pictures of my dog \ud83d\ude00 \n\nI'd be down for creating a discord server or a gaming group if this thing lasts so if you think we'd be a good match then PM me \ud83d\ude00", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Like have i somehow messed up so bad that i dont deserve to have any friends that wont turn on me? Its gotten so bad that now when people try to act friendly and be friends with me all i can think to tell them is to just give it a few weeks and they'll start treating me like the POS i guess i am.

Some of my favorite bands are Muse, Leprous, Radiohead and Arcade Fire. I currently play guitar (I'm planning on taking classes but I can\u00b4t at the moment because of money ~~and social anxiety~~).\n\nSpeaking of which, yea I'm quiite shy. I've always had social anxiety and although it's been getting better it's still very present in my everyday life. So yeaa you'll have to deal with that. I'll be 100% trying my best to make a good conversation tho and I expect you to do the same. I had a lot of other experiences where it felt like I was doing an interrogation and I hate that, we need to get to know each other :)\n\nI also play some video games, just got a new awesome laptop so I can finally play.

I also have a few hobbies, such as programming (primarily C++, but I'm capable in a handful of other languages), digital art, playing vidya gaimz (Stardew Valley, Terraria, Minecraft, etc.) getting outside for walks whenever the weather allows it (and maybe taking a few photos along the way), listening to music (60s/70s stuff like the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and The Rolling Stones, as well as Electro Swing and some more experimental stuff).\n\nI'd like to consider myself an accepting, open-minded, and non-judgemental person, and I welcome pretty much everyone with open arms!

He\u2019s an intense, hard-living kind of guy. Always getting in fights, conflict followed him everywhere. Booze, drugs, sex, crime, he\u2019d always managed to avoid jail time somehow, and he instinctively never involved me in his shenanigans; I think he\u2019s always had a protective instinct for me. Not only am I quieter, meeker, far less brave, bold, or confrontational, but I\u2019ve pretty much always weighed 100 lbs less than him. I went through some shit too, chronic illness and divorce, and he was always there for me.\n\nAnyway, a couple months ago some stuff went down. His wife and I had always been somewhat friends and whenever he was acting particularly crazy, she\u2019d call me and vent. I even suggested on several occasions that she take the kids and leave. She wouldn\u2019t. Her choice of course. He even knew that I\u2019d told her this and we still remained besties. Well this particular incident a few months ago was the turning point I guess. He assaulted his wife\u2019s parents and got accused of hitting one of his kids. His wife called me, distraught, and I helped talk her through some options over the course of a couple days. He never called me... and honestly I avoided calling him. I was genuinely afraid to talk to him.\n\nWell he ended up with a protective order preventing him from seeing his kids or wife, and he\u2019s headed for divorce and may lose all rights to his kids permanently. He finally called me up a several days after the incident to ask why I hadn\u2019t reached out to him. Well I guess I hadn\u2019t realized how much fear and frustration I\u2019d been absorbing from the situation and I ended up blowing up at him and hanging up. I texted and tried to apologize a few times but I guess he blocked me. So I sent him a message on Facebook the other day to wish him a happy birthday, tell him I\u2019m sorry, and tell him he could call me any time. He basically replied that he was done with me and asked me to never contact him again.\n\nSo I guess I\u2019m asking for advice. Yes he\u2019s got issues, yes he needs to get help. But he\u2019s been such a mainstay in my life, and I\u2019ve been the same for him. I\u2019m still in the denial stage I think, and I\u2019m rolling the situation all around in my head trying to figure out if I should keep trying, or just give up and move on.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}
