As the title suggests I finally managed to break loose from my mental shackles after having dealt with depression for 5 years. A month has passed and I feel I've improved a lot as a person but I'm still stuck with the feeling of loneliness since I don't have any close friends aside from my acquaintances, so here I am in hope I'll find some online pals.\n\nI just quit my job at a local cafe, so I'm not occupied with anything since I've taken a break in my studies. I fill most my days with hours spent doing a lot of nonproductive things such as listening to music, playing games on my Switch or watching shows/anime.\n\nI also love to conversate about deep and engaging subjects and just life in general. I'd consider myself spiritual but not religious, I often think about what's beyond this life and what my purpose is.\n\nI don't mind if our time zones differ, so feel free to reply even if you're not from EU.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I live in New York City. I like things that my age group for some reason doesn\u2019t like. I took an online personality test my results were: (ESFJ-A).\n\nStory Time:\n\nWhen I was growing up, I lived in the 2000s but for some reason my parents felt the need to stay in the 80s. So when everyone had an Xbox 360 and a PS2 and 3, I had a SNES, a NES, a Game Boy/Color/Advance/Sp. I had the older generation consoles playing games like Contra (a shoot \u2019em up game) and Super Mario Bros. It was very interesting childhood indeed. When I get a tad bit older I will become a bodyguard, I\u2019m going to protect who ever I can and that\u2019s about it. Heehee.\n\nI\u2019m a really diverse person, trying new things and trying to be my very best at it. Some of the things I like or have done are:\n\n* **Games**: I also have an Xbox One so I can join the modern era of players nowadays. I\u2019ve also dabbled in SBM, so I\u2019m a Marth main, Ult Marth is garbo-toxin (I like Pok\u00e9mon too).\n\n* **Music**: I listen strict 80\u2019s music, Synthwave and Hip-Hop/Emo Hip-Hop (XXX, Lil Peep and Juice Wrld) I\u2019ve also made music before, so I have really good musical talents as that both my parent created music before I was born. I also have 10 years with the piano and 1 with the guitar. I completed my music class course (3 classes) in 1 year. :D\n\n* **TV**: I\u2019ve watched The Office, Prison Break, (still watching) The Unbreakable Kimmy Shcmidt, Ozark and Hilda. I think Kimmy really sums up my personality pretty well, living in somewhat isolation then entering the world all brand new and stuff.\n\n* **Movies**: I\u2019ve only watched 80\u2019s movies like Back to the Future, Gremlins, Ghost Busters, The Goonies, Sixteen Candles, The Karate Kid, E.T. The Never Ending Story and so on. The last movie I actually watched which was in 2009 (Ikr) was The Fantastic Mr. Fox! (My personal favorite maybe cause I was a kid and thats what I wanted to watch, idk lol)\n\n* **Books**: Of Mice and Men (sometimes I feel like Lennie) Romeo and Juliet and The Fault in our Stars. (These were all school books read for book reports, lol)\n\n* **Art**: I know how to draw, I\u2019ve taken art classes before and failed on purpose cause I don\u2019t need the class. I know, weird flex huh? But really, I didn\u2019t need the classes and they kept giving them to me\u2026 I\u2019m not crazy good at art like some realistic stuff, but I\u2019m a very quick learner so yep. My Skelly Babe: https://ibb.co/GsqxNKB\n\n* **Photography**: I\u2019ve also taken photos too, not with a camera but with my phone. Heres a picture I took last year: https://ibb.co/J2vtBwS\n\n* **Exercise**: I do calisthenics, my workouts are: \n\nCore: Planks, V-Ups, Crunches, Reverse Crunches\n\nArms: Tricep Dips, Pushups, Jabs, 1-2s, Pull-Ups\n\nLegs: Squats, Lunges\n\nBack: Superman pose\n\n* **Creation**: When I was a wee little speck, I made tons of stuff, pulleys, levers, cars, make shift TVs and forts. I still retain that mentality, but I just don\u2019t have the space to do all that anymore. Also dabbled in the playing of legos and junk, made the mistake of super gluing them\u2026 *sigh*\n\nSo message me! I\u2019m a really cool human, I really am, plus I\u2019m an Aquarius and a humanitarian so you just got double, teehee! Message me!!!!\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

You can no longer enter one of the bedrooms because it's so piled up with  junk. Her garage is almost the same way now. She has always suffered from anxiety and ADHD. I do too and it's one of the things that have bonded us in the past. We talk about our medications, we have meditated and practiced yoga together. Lately though her OCD has been making it increasingly difficult for her to leave her house. A few weeks ago (the last time I saw her) we had made plans to go to the Women's March. At 9AM when I told her I was ready to go she immediately burst into tears and had a full blown panic attack. I didn't know how to react so I sat quietly on the couch while she ran around the house in a frenzy getting ready. I didn't care because I was only going for fun, all I had said was \"I'm ready\" and it ruined the whole event. She only wanted to stay about 30 mins, refused to bring her sign down, and then we stopped at a thrift store for her for another 30 mins. I didn't say anything because I felt guilty I wasn't more helpful during her panic attack. Looking back I'm not sure what I could have done. \n\n Tasks MUST be done in a specific order known only to her. The last time I tried to help clean up she screamed at me because I was not taking out the recycling that correct way. Not that I was dumping in the wrong bins or anything but the WAY I was holding the recycling to take outside was wrong. Since everything has to be completed in a specific manner and order no one else can really help and she gets overwhelmed with basic housework.  Her anxiety is through the roof and whenever I had tried to address it with her she alternates between getting angry at me or crying.  I always have to back down because I know she's already having a tough time and I don't want to be negative and add to it.  \n\nHer behavior has gotten so bad she has alienated a lot of people. I am still sticking by her, I love her and I don't want to abandon her while she's going through a tough year. However, the state inside her house has made it so that my OWN anxiety escalates when I go in. How can I tell her that I still want to hang out with her but only outside of her house? We are supposed to hang out tonight because she has to put her dog down soon. I made an joke about picking her up and me being her Lyft driver to excuse the fact that I'm not going inside her house tonight. But eventually she's going to notice and ask. How can I tell her that her hoarding and her anxiety is making it so that I can't be in her house anymore without ruining the friendship?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Since she refused to talk, I talked to him, and she would pop in every half hour / hour or so just to playfully roast me like we usually do, except it was much more meanspirited in my eyes. Each time she does this coldness I call her out on it, telling her she is cold and distant and she is hurting me with hurtful words and actions and I wish that she would be kinder and friendlier like she usually is. She makes me feel guilty as if I've done something wrong to her, and as if her coldness is my punishment.

I live in Northern California with my partner (a man) of 17 years &amp; our 4 kids ages 15, 12, 7 &amp; 8 months. We had our first son young &amp; meeting a \u201ctribe\u201d of fellow moms to be \u201cbesties\u201d with was one of things that I was most excited about. Sadly, 15 years later, that has yet to happen! I\u2019ve found that finding &amp; establishing mom friendships is much harder than I expected! I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m not your typical mommy-type (sorry if that sounds stereotypical or offends anyone). Most of my interests, parenting &amp; lifestyle choices would be considered by most crunchy (hippieish). With people I consider my friends, I am open about everything! Nothing\u2019s \u201coff the table\u201d! My hair has been dyed every color of the rainbow,  I have piercings, tattoos &amp; am in the process of gauging my ears, I love to blast some hip hop, reggaet\u00f3n, anything with a good beat actually, I belly dance &amp; would love to learn to pole dance, I try to dress age-appropriately, but still fashionably, all just stuff that makes me stand out next to the average mom. That coupled with the fact that I\u2019m a loud, proud Latina who likes to keep it real makes it hard for me to fit in I guess! The sad part is that I am an extremely loyal, empathic, respectful &amp; non-judge mental person who doesn\u2019t think twice about going above &amp; beyond for the people in my life that I love &amp; feel blessed to have! It sounds weird, but I wish so badly that I could find just ONE friend that\u2019s as true as a friend as I am! I\u2019ve never valued friendships in quantity but quality anyway so I don\u2019t need a ton of friends to be happy, just a few solid ones. Other moms just seem to judge my exterior &amp; since it\u2019s different than theirs they just seem to write me off right away. I just want a chance to prove that while I might not look exactly like them I would still be a positive, supportive addition to their lives, but the proud side of me prevents me from pushing myself out there &amp; trying, despite their \u201cjudgy\u201d looks &amp; attitudes. \nAwhile back, a mom in one of my kids classes who I once confided all of this to said that most of the typical moms were probably afraid to bring me home to meet their husbands. TBH, that totally caught me off guard &amp; I didn\u2019t know what to think when she said that! Obviously, I would never even think about going there &amp; when I told her so she said that she only meant that they might be hesitant because so many moms \u201clet themselves go\u201d after having kids.

We would stay up super late talking about anything, we would watch TV together all the time, and we would do homework together. I love her like a sister and I firmly believe we are going to be friends for a long time. However, I've made more friends in my classes and I love them too. Thing is, I've been spending every day with my new friends and spending a lot of time at their dorm, even sleeping over sometimes. I'm worried that my roommate is feeling abandoned and I don't want to hurt her feelings by being with my other friends all the time (but I just started a new anime with them and we've been binging it, so I find myself at their place almost every night since the semester started).\n\nAnother thing, my roommate is shy, but has met my new friends before and they have gotten along fine. I honestly believe that she would fit very well into our friend group, but I don't want to put too much pressure on her to get to know my friends because I know how uncomfortable she is around new people (and it's something we've literally talked about before, so it's not like I'm assuming her feelings), which might be weird because I'm hoping to live with all three of them (roommate and new friends) when we all get out of the dorms (something we've all talked about and agreed on). I don't want her to feel like an outsider because I really do care for her. I feel bad that I haven't been spending time with her like I used to but I have so much fun at my friends' place and I've apologized to her about not being around so often.\n\nAm I being a bad friend to my roommate?

We became closer than ever and I started to consider her as a sister. \n\nYesterday, we were texting, and I asked her who else she was talking to. She said that she was texting her friend, but I later learned that she was actually texting another guy (with whom she has no relationship intention). I was just wondering if it was normal for me to feel such hate towards the whole situation.  So my question is: How can I be less jealous, because this is literally killing me right now...", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm looking for someone that text more then two words. Let's have a real conversation. I'm looking for Only Guys. I relate to them more. I'm a guy and gay but I am partnered. I'm not looking for sex or a hook up or trading. Just looking to gain another friend. I have a friend I've been having for three years. We have never seen each other in person. Skyped a few times. We also talk on the phone for hours about anything. He's straight. But he respects me for me. He knows I'm not trying to get in his pants or want anything but his friendship. \n\nSo what I am looking for is another friend like that. You can be gay or straight or bi. I don't care. As long as we keep it on a friend level. Even maybe become best friends. I would like to have someone else to talk to. I love my partner and I'm not bored of him. Just would like to have one more friend. I prefer to text. I'm not opposed to giving my number out. Its the easiest way for me to communicate. Because I can speech to text while I'm working. But first we'll need to get to know each other for a bit. I have a Kik. \n\nMaybe even Skype. If your straight please be comfortable with yourself. I gay and I have problems too and id like to talk about them with you. So I need you to be comfortable with yourself. If you only reply with five or less words I'll just stop talking to you. Im looking for real conversation. Real friends. I just stop talking to someone who was always depressed on Reddit. Everytime Wed talk they were depressed. But there life was good. Nothing was wrong. That I knew of. I'm not looking for any one like that. I also can not text you back as fast as you want. In not ghosting I just work and have a life. So don't expect quick responses ALL the time.  I know I'm asking much but I need to be detailed with this. \n\nThanks for reading. ", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

But the problem is that I don\u2019t rly like the other guy bc he has literally no one else but us and he is constantly following me everywhere (including toilets in some cases). I hate it bc I just need some space and my other friends hate him too so they try and hide from me bc he follows me. Also there have been rumours going around that he sends/asks for nude images, that he masturbates in the toilets during lessons, that he\u2019s gay and there are other ones along the same lines. And I know that I shouldn\u2019t let it bother me and that I should stand up for him but I really don\u2019t want to be associated with these. I didn\u2019t know what to do (I still don\u2019t) so I thought that if I asked that girl who I go to the park with she would give me an unbiased answer and help me tell him. When I did tell her at the time she seemed pretty understanding and she just dropped it until I was in lunch one day with them both and this other guy and I got up to get a drink and when I came back she left and then a few moments later he left. Then the other dude said that she had told him which honestly didn\u2019t bother me I just wanted to know why she did. So when I got home me and the other guy were FaceTiming and then I decided I should ask her. she replied but she said she didn\u2019t and the other guy probably wanted beef but the annoying guy even said she did (I had apologised to him at this point and told him how I felt) but I don\u2019t know who to believe because he did admit he lied to me and said she didn\u2019t want to be my friend. And since then she has been ignoring all my messages ( how are you? Did you find the french test hard? Are you mad at me? Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?) but she definitely did read them. And if she was telling the truth I can understand (to some extent) why she would ignore me. But when i talked to her in person she was fine (apart from at the end of the day I said I couldn\u2019t go to the park then she said \u2018fine, I don\u2019t care\u2019 idk if she meant it that way though) however I never spoke about the \u2018beef\u2019 that was going on. \n\nAnd all this crap has triggered this sadness in my mind that I can\u2019t get rid of which idk what to do abt it. Like something will trigger it I last had it in the Xmas break. It\u2019s just like a wave of sadness and it starts by me spiralling though a train of thought and overthinking everything until it doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. But then the sadness can get rly intense and like I can\u2019t even think about it anything to try and solve it but then it will go into the back of my mind and just be there then anything that reminds me of it makes me super like sad (when I say sad I mean like \u2018bummed out\u2019 or like I\u2019ve lost my spark and I have butterflies in my stomach). Idk what to do abt this and I dread when it will come back.\n\nLike this school year started off really good. I had made new friends, I had got a new phone for xmas, I started to diet which was going rly well. But recently like this week it\u2019s all gone to crap.\n\nI start thinking why does she hate me? Then I think wait I don\u2019t need her I have other friends but then I think that they can be kind of mean to me but then I have this friend who is THE BEST and we\u2019re best friends but then really as nice as he is I get bored of just one friend and he is different to me and my other friends (he also has his own) and I think I need somebody else that\u2019s rly nice to move to this school. But then along with all the other dreams I have I realise that there is a slim chance that they will happen. Then I go back and forth thinking that I shouldn\u2019t waste my time thinking abt that and then the mentality that \u2018I can dream\u2019 and if it makes me happy what\u2019s the problem? (Also it really winds me up that luck is never really on my side)\n\nAnd with the girl I really like her but I don\u2019t know in what way I don\u2019t no if it\u2019s friends or I want to go out with her . But all I know is that I like her and I want to spend time with her.\n\nPlease help me with as much as you can I\u2019m really confused I don\u2019t know what to do or what I have done to get into this.

I play a lot of popular online games you may have, like Overwatch, LoL, Rainbow 6 and so on. I don\u2019t play them really often and I'm not very good but if you want me to play them with you I'll be glad to.\n* Reading and Writing, i mainly read Fantasy and Sci-fi as you could guess, i like LotR of course, The Witcher and I'm currently reading Isaac Asimov\u2019s books. I started writing recently, but I'm not a very proficient or prolific writer, but i try to get better.\n* I love playing Tabletop RPGs and Board Games, unfortunately i don\u2019t have the chance to play them really often.\n* I love music, i listen to a lot of Indie Rock and Indie Electronica, and I listen to a bit of Electropop and Heavy/Power Metal. My favourites artists and bands are Crywolf, Echos, Lights, Eden, Yoe Mase, Lord Huron, Daughter and Lords of the Trident. I started playing the acoustic guitar almost one year ago and I'm doing fairly well i guess.\n* I really like medieval fantasy.

I also know quite a bit about medieval weapons and fight and i can share with you if you wish to.\n\nI like talking about everything, from philosophic or scientific talk to complete nonsense.

I am secular.\n\nHe left Christianity entirely for a number of years and then has come back to it around 3 years go.\n\nOver the last year he has become more and more involved with the Christian community in his area (not Mormon) and has decided he has found his faith again and believes the Bible is true.\n\nI don't have a problem with any of that, in fact I have explored a lot of the teachings myself just out of interest and being his friend and talking about it. But recently he has been very distant. Does not reply to my messages with any kind of interest if at all, never answers when I ask to meet up and then a couple of days ago sent me a message telling me he has been very focused on Luke 14:25-35 and Matthew 25:1-13 which are stories about the cost of following Jesus. You must hate your mother and father and friends if you want to follow me is the first one and the second one is the story of the 10 virgins. Where 5 of the virgins are smart and keep their lamps filled with oil, but the other 5 aren't and try to borrow oil and miss the party they are invited to because they go home to get more.\n\nBasically I think he is saying through the quotes that he wants to give all his energy to Christianity and he doesn't have the \"oil\" to be my friend and listen to my problems (I am depressed and have struggled with addiction to cannabis. Worth mentioning that he has also struggled with addiction to alcohol.) Or something like that. I am just really surprised at the change in him and I don't know if I am overthinking it.\n\nIf any of you are Christian, is this something you would do if you felt that a friend was holding you back from God in some way? I mean obviously I don't have a choice either way if he isn't going to reply to my messages that is an explanation in itself but I just wonder if I am taking the quotes he sent too literally. It's not like I can ask him \"does this mean you don't want to be my friend anymore?\" that just sounds ridiculous.\n\nAny thoughts appreciated!\n\nThanks\n\n \n\n### The Cost of Being a Disciple\n\n**25**\u00a0Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said:**26**\u00a0\u201cIf anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters\u2014yes, even their own life\u2014such a person cannot be my disciple. **27**\u00a0And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.\n\n**28**\u00a0\u201cSuppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won\u2019t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it?**29**\u00a0For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, **30**\u00a0saying, \u2018This person began to build and wasn\u2019t able to finish.\u2019\n\n**31**\u00a0\u201cOr suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won\u2019t he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand? **32**\u00a0If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace. **33**\u00a0In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples.\n\n**34**\u00a0\u201cSalt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? **35**\u00a0It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out.\n\n\u201cWhoever has ears to hear, let them hear.\u201d\n\n \n\n### The Parable of the Ten Virgins\n\n**25**\u00a0\u201cAt that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. **2**\u00a0Five of them were foolish and five were wise. **3**\u00a0The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. **4**\u00a0The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. **5**\u00a0The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.\n\n**6**\u00a0\u201cAt midnight the cry rang out: \u2018Here\u2019s the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!\u2019\n\n**7**\u00a0\u201cThen all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. **8**\u00a0The foolish ones said to the wise, \u2018Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.\u2019\n\n**9**\u00a0\u201c\u2018No,\u2019 they replied, \u2018there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.\u2019\n\n**10**\u00a0\u201cBut while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.\n\n**11**\u00a0\u201cLater the others also came. \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 they said, \u2018open the door for us!\u2019\n\n**12**\u00a0\u201cBut he replied, \u2018Truly I tell you, I don\u2019t know you.\u2019\n\n**13**\u00a0\u201cTherefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I was hoping that spending some time alone would be beneficial for both of us. But now she came  back to visit and I can\u2019t help but thinking that she has become a monster.\nI can\u2019t stand what she\u2019s done to me, the emotional abuse and the opportunism towards me, a friend that strived to make her feel good. I don\u2019t think she has changed a bit. Perhaps she is even worse now, I can see she still want to abuse me emotionally and would absolutely turn a blind eye to my qualities or my will to reconciliation. Why is she doing this I don\u2019t know. I think she can\u2019t get past the fact that we have never been anything more than friends even when the time would have been right to take a step beyond that. But I truly don\u2019t know. She is just another person and I cannot see anything I could have done to be in this situation. It\u2019s completely irrational.\n\nNow I wish her to leave me alone but I can\u2019t just tell her to leave, it would be rude and against my values. Trying to have a talk about how I feel on the other hand would result in another argument. And not doing anything would result in her using (and possibly abusing) me and my hospitality only to kick me out of this \u201cfriendship\u201d again once she doesn\u2019t need me anymore.\n\nGlad to be volunteering all day tomorrow so I don\u2019t have to see her. I\u2019ll probably stay out as much as possible so I don\u2019t have to be around her. Basically I\u2019ll keep myself out of my own house.

I would like to meet someone to establish a real and substantial long-term friendship.   If you're only interested in casual conversations or aren't interested in actually getting to know someone, you might click better with someone else.\n\nSome background on me:  I moved to Arizona from Michigan about 4 years ago.  In that time, I have not been able to establish any social connections.  I am a bit of an introverted/loner type and generally prefer to keep to myself, but still highly value friendship.  I have always preferred quality over quantity and usually feel quite nervous in social situations with new people.  \n\nI enjoy having deep conversations on a wide variety of topics, such as music, politics, religion, relationships, human behavior, etc. I am at least conversant in most things, and if its something that you're passionate about, then I would love to talk about that too. I like to debate and accept that logic, reason and science are the most effective tools for understanding reality. I am an atheist and a skeptic.\n\nWe don't have to be exactly the same age; I would just prefer you to be 24-25 or older. I am open as far as gender is concerned.  I generally find myself getting along better with guys, but would really love a female best friend as well.  It would be great if you were from the Phoenix metro area, or Arizona in general.  If not, that's okay.  I'm open to talking regularly through the internet or text messages.\n\nAt this point, I am very focused on self-improvement and bringing up my standard of living.  I work full time as a developer at a University.  It is my first job as a developer, so it is really terrifying and exciting at the same time.  \n\nBeyond that, I am a huge fan of music and a musician myself. I listen to an extremely wide variety of music, including to some of the following genres: Electronic dance music, heavy metal (doom, death, sludge, black, stoner, etc..), gothic rock, classical, industrial, ambient, synth-pop, post rock, and more.\n\nI also like computer games, programming, hiking, graphic design, fashion, makeup, etc.  \n\nAnyway, I think that I've gone on for long enough. If something resonates with you, send me a message and introduce yourself.\n\nThanks!\n\nDayna", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

But the thing is, deep down inside I didn't even believe that a little bit and I'll tell you why.\n\nFor a person that calls me a close friend, F treats me like the exact opposite.

Although gaming is a central part of our group, we chat about movies, music, and all kinds of random topics as well, so there\u2019s sure to be something for everyone!\n\nA little about the group: we tend to look for those that are 25+, as there can be some mature topics in discussion at any time, although we are pretty lenient (we do ask for everyone to be 21 years or older).  We are not interested in people looking for hookups or other sexual activities in the group, so please do not bother messaging if that is your intent.\n\nIf this group sounds like it\u2019s your cup of tea, or you just want to check out the madness for yourself, please PM me with a little info about yourself and I will get back to you!

Right After high school she got married to a guy I really didn\u2019t like. Him and I have had multiple problems in the past mainly how he treated me and how she\u2019d let him do I and think it was funny, it got so bad when he called me a pedophile at a elementary school fair in a crowd of at least a 100 kids and their family and they all gave me this look how horror. while my my friend and her boyfriend (now husband) laugh and I didn\u2019t talk to them for at least six months and she apologized and we became friends again. I was the maid of honor at her wedding and his best man has sexually assaulted me the night before her wedding and that night made it about her self saying how he could have done that to her. didn\u2019t really care about the shock and horror I was going though still to this day makes that night and it about her to the point to don\u2019t let her come to the court cases because it always about her BUT that\u2019s not even the problem just some of the back story\nOH! By the way we are all 19 \nSo we all moved in together and everything was great I mean he was still an ass never clean the house once in the entire time I lived there or clean up after him self with the quote \u201cI never make a mess or use anything in the kitchen why would I have to\u201d and when we point out all the dishes he uses just yells at us and makes it ours fault but then around four months he start hitting her and me and emotionally abusing us her way worst then me but she didn\u2019t tell me so I never knew or heard it, but about a week ago she made her and I leave the apartment gave me 20 minutes to pack my stuff because she was supposedly leaving him and gave me no where to go. I was basically homeless for a week and my boyfriend let me crash at his place for a few days. and she wouldn\u2019t let me get my stuff I wasn\u2019t allowed back into the place being really rude to me and so I finally got my parents to let me stay with them, and me and my family finally spend a weekend getting all of my thing and they where being really rude about the whole situation. come to find out she moved back in with him didn\u2019t tell me (obviously why she didn\u2019t want me back in there because obviously I\u2019d find out) she had locked her door knowing some of my stuff that was in the dryer was in there. I had a key that\u2019s unlocked it and got my things Come to find out she has also stolen stuff form me mostly books and other small things but enough to piss me off. and she is now making it impossible for me to get my name off the lease. so I can find another home being hurtful and down right rude got my other friend and her to gang up on me and say hurtful thing about my boyfriend and I basically lost my entire friend groups and seriously can\u2019t figure what I did that was so wrong to deserve this. All we do is argue when we talk I just want anything else she has stolen and my name off the lease and she is basically saying go fuck yourself so done at this point. \n\nI just can\u2019t believe that 11 years of friendships is down the drain. how different she is acting. why she is treating me this way.

This is my first time posting (been lurking for a few weeks) but I'm frustrated with this situation and was hoping you all might be able to help.\n\nI (21F) have known this guy (about 3 years older than me, our future Ghost) for many years and have been close with his family since middle school. We come from a conservative background, but he and I have always been more progressive than most of the people we grew up with. I moved out of state for college while he and most of the rest of our high school friends went to state schools a few hours from home. We hung out *around* each other a lot in high school but became much closer when we were both living independently and started experimenting with sex/alcohol/weed (which none of our other friends would dream of.) We'd text nearly every day and when I was sexually assaulted sophomore year he was the only person I felt like I could talk to about it. We had brief flings here and there that always ended with him meeting someone local or us deciding we were better off as platonic friends (which we are, that's not just a line.) We've always been good at communicating clearly with one another and when we pushed each others buttons (it happened a lot) we could generally resolve it quickly and move on with a better understanding of one another.\n\nFast forward to this past summer. Ghost was abroad for the summer and we didn't talk as much due to time zones. I got drunk one night, slept with one of my close male friends at school (call him R), and it turned into the healthiest, happiest relationships I've ever been in. My relationship with R got very intense very fast, and excluding our respective visits home every few months we haven't spent a day apart since September/October maybe. Obviously this has changed the dynamics of many of my friendships, but he's always been supportive of my independence and my friends love him almost as much as I do. My friendship with Ghost understandably makes him uncomfortable given our history, but I haven't seen Ghost in year and have never had a problem with monogamy anyway, so it never caused a problem for the relationship. Despite that, I can admit I invested less energy in my friendship with Ghost than I used to so R wouldn't feel any reason to worry. Ghost got back to the states a few months ago and I found we had less to talk about now that I was out of the dating pool and had my mental health in a better place. He had changed also, as people do when they live abroad, and I liked his new open-mindedness but was annoyed by his new condescending attitude. I also felt he was unsupportive of my relationship, so I tried to bring R into our conversations less. Naturally we drifted apart a bit, which is normal as people grow and situations change. Regardless, I still consider him family and had no intention of cutting him out of my life any time soon.\n\nI can't tell you quite when his attitude changed, but as winter set in Ghost got very distant. He rarely if ever texted me first, his responses to my texts got less thoughtful and open-ended, and he would never respond to my snapchats. The last time we spoke was Christmas Eve when I sent him a meme and got a half-assed response. I found out later via his Instagram that he spent several days in town hanging out with our friends and didn't even tell me he was home for the holidays. I was hurt and stopped trying to initiate conversation after that. I've included him in drunk mass snapchats maybe twice since then and, as usual, got no response.\n\nAt this point, I've given up on the friendship. I've never been one to force people to be in my life, and if he's done being my friend then that's his choice. However, I do feel like I'm owed an explanation. We've seen each other through too much shit and been too close for too long for him to do something as juvenile as ghost me. What I don't want to do, however, is text him out of the blue sounding whiny or entitled to attention. I guess what I'm asking is this: do I let him go his own way without ever knowing why and take the injustice on the chin, or do I call him out (and if so, how?) Any and all objective insight is welcome. If you think I was an ass in some way, I want to know if I need to apologize. And if there's a subreddit better suited for this question, please let me know as I'm new to the site. I'm just seeking some clarity here and maybe some closure if that's possible.\n\nTl;dr, one of my best friends of many years stopped talking to me for no clear reason. Do I reach out for an explanation or just walk away?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She has always been sweet and kind and would do anything for you at the drop of a hat. She is friendly she used to friendly but shy but she came out of her shell so much so sometimes I am shocked when I have conversations with her because that is not the person I am used to. Over the years we have drifted apart but always seem to find each other and really enjoy each others company. Over the past at least 5 or so years my friend has decided to have this group friend thing going on which i don't understand. about 5 or so of them are constantly together. I have been invited and I do like all of them. They often ask each other to go out to various places throughout the week and they always seem to end up together, whether its out to eat, shopping, or going to a local event. They often even vacation and travel together. I was invited once on a trip that became a nightmare. So much so I told her there was no way I would do it again unless my husband came along so if things got really bad we could do our own thing. She understood and said it was the worst trips they had and apologized. Even though looking back a lot of it was her trying to take control of the situation.... The whole trip was the blind leading the blind and it got frustrating quickly. Since then, needless to say, I have not been invited back on a trip. One of the other ladies got into a fight with them and is \"no longer part of the group.\" Recently at a very rare time, It was just me and my friend (usually at least one of her groupies is with her) We were talking and she said that she felt \"left out\" and that one of the other ladies in the group is not  inviting her to things and she thinks they are mad and she barely hangs out with the group. She then goes into detail about the argument leading one of the ladies to \"leave the group.\" I flat out told her that I \"wasn't part of teh group\" and based on what you say I understand why you're upset but I feel that you guys come together so much so that it could be overwhelming for some people to deal with. I told her I felt left out on a big part of her life. I told her I don't want to be doing group things every week because I don't but it did hurt my feelings seeing her with the other girls all the time and I was never invited to the get-togethers. I also proceed to tell her that I know they are off a lot more than I am ( I am the only person working full time.) I said I wish I could be part of your group just to know whats going on. I probably wouldn't be able to attend 3/4 of the things but just to be included would feel nice. She then proceeds to tell me that its not \"up to her\" who joins the group, and that because I don't have an iPhone it will mess the chat up... Her husband confirms it saying (he also has this group friendship thing) mainly involving this group of ladies significant others... They simply used another platform... I think he was hinting she and her friends do the same and it was no excuse but she didn't take it that way. After talking to my friend about everything she has been slightly more communicable with me and we don't go months without talking like we have the past few years, but once again I see the \"group\" eating out tonight. I would have not been able to partake but I am jealous they get too. I know everyone has there problems they are dealing with and maybe no one likes the group and they all just do it because they think the other people like it. When I reconnect with this friend we always see how similar our personal lives are and I think thats what keeps us together because we are the only ones who understand each other in the end. I guess that is all that should matte but it's not. I feel like I am a convenience friend for when everyone else falls through. ", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm very familiar with her family situation (one of seven kids, mom has three baby daddy's, current husband \\[step dad\\] is a cocaine addict, mother struggling to pay bills, mother is use to toxic relationships, sisters are irresponsible and dramatic, biological father deported to another country).\n\nShe's been in this seven year relationship she's ended about six times (mind you, she's 24) with a boy who I really dislike. They're constantly arguing, she always catches an attitude with him over the most trivial things, and if she goes out to see a friend that's not in their friend circle (for example, me) he says, \"okay cool go have fun with your side guy.\"\n\nShe doesn't live at home anymore and lives at her boyfriends MOM's house. The mom is extremely petty and dirty and my friend does her best to steer clear, but as petty moms do, they like to start drama.\n\nShe had to drop out of college with one year to spare because she couldn't afford it anymore. In terms of her job situation, she works making an OKAY salary. About $18 an hour which isn't enough when she owes $30,000+ in student loans and pays a car lease of $600 WITH a $350 insurance policy on it. (I told her prior to getting this car that it's STUPID if she does it, I didn't realize it's a $1,000 a month bill!!!!) Her excuse? I needed something good for myself and I really wanted this.\n\nOn top of that I've noticed she's gained a substantial amount of weight which makes her very insecure and not feeling very pretty.\n\nI tried to offer her the friendly advice and told her she needs to start with small changes (STARTING WITH HER BUM ASS RELATIONSHIP) but she's so TERRIFIED of being single. She has NO confidence and it KILLS me. I offered to find her a therapist because it's her way of thinking that I believe is holding her back. \n\nPart of me gets upset with her because although I try to include her on my plans I never get an invitation to hang with her. And once I do invite her, she never even comes or she has to ask, \"boyfriend.\" I don't sugar coat things. I hold back NOW because I noticed she really distanced herself from me when I was honest and direct.  Now I try to listen and emphasize certain things she says.\n\nTL; DR My friend who's 24 years olds is in a bad environment, toxic relationship, financial turmoil and miserable.

So, we decided to get what we have always ordered but this time it was different. Matt decided to add an additional egg to his meal which shocked me since he never liked eggs in the first place. \u201cBut I guess that changed after he went to Japan for a month\u201d I thought to myself so I shrugged it off.\n\nFast forward to when our meals were to arrive at our table, I noticed Matt asked the waiter for soy sauce for his egg which I found it unpleasant since I didn\u2019t like soy sauce on my eggs. I\u2019d preferred salt on my eggs rather than soy sauce to be honest. And so when the waiter came with the soy sauce, Matt didn\u2019t put like a few drops on the egg. He practically poured the whole bottle on it! So I was like \u201cMatt. What are you doing?\u201d And he replied \u201cJust putting a lil\u2019 soy sauce\u201d, uhh.. what? Am I missing something? Pouring the bottle isn\u2019t exactly \u201clittle\u201d in my book.\n\nI decided not to question his choices any further and finally we were about to eat before he saw my egg with salt and questioned why I used salt rather than soy sauce. And that right there was the point in time where we had an argument over whichever was better on eggs. Eventually asking people around for opinions on the matter. Hell, I still I can remember it like it was yesterday! The customers in the shop were staring at us too! \n\nAnd yeah.. we argued for a few minutes, enough for our meals to get cold and soggy.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

She had been going through really tough personal problems and I gave her a lot of advice relating to these issues.

She did not come to my birthday party the following month (September) a few days before she sent me a message saying she couldn't make it. 2 months later she sent me a brief message saying she had been mentally unwell but had been feeling better - then silence again until New Year. A few days ago she sent me a message saying she's sorry she had been gone for quite some time - I asked her if she was ok and if she was free to talk - though I did make it clear I didn't want her to feel like I was pressuring her and she read the message but no reply again.\n\n2 weeks before she stopped regular contact there was one night where she had a mental breakdown crying about the problem\nshe was having which is something that has been very hard on her. She went through periods of extreme happiness and claiming to be moving forward from this problem and periods of extreme sadness. She mentioned her doctor advised her to get a diagnosis for bipolar disorder shortly before she ceased regular communication. I am concerned about her and I miss her presence in my life as whenever I think about her I get a pang of sadness and used to randomly sometimes even burst into tears as I feel lonely without her company and advice. I have other friends and have been dating some guys - basically I've tried to keep my mind off of her disappearance but every so often it comes back and hits me right in the chest.

Apologies in advance that this is kind of a long story, I will try to be as concise as possible! Also, fake names will be used for anonymity! I am a 29 year old single female. \n\nAbout 3 years ago I became friends with a woman a few years older than me because she and her husband moved into my apartment building. Their names are Ann and Dave. Ann is from another country. She came to the US for school but ended up meeting Dave and they fell in love and decided to get married. It quickly became apparent that their relationship was unstable and verbally/emotionally abusive. Dave was an alcoholic and was refusing to petition for Ann\u2019s green card; her visa was soon to expire. Their issues continued to escalate. I helped Ann find an immigration attorney to assist her in filing her VAWA (violence against women act), which after 2 years finally got approved and now she has her green card. My dad even lent her $2500 to help her pay the lawyer. During that time, she and Dave got divorced. Ann found a great job in her desired field. I also learned that she had 2 children of her own back in her home country that she left with her mother. I never asked too many questions about this, who am I to judge? Anyways, shortly after divorcing Dave she met a new man named John. John has 2 children of his own from a past girlfriend. Ann and John\u2019s relationship quickly grew serious, they ended up moving in together. When it was John\u2019s time to have the kids (he and their mother have 50/50 custody) they would all stay together...John, Ann, and John\u2019s 2 children. This did not sit right with me, for the sake of the children. They were getting very attached to Ann; what if one day Ann and John split up? It would be the children who would suffer the most. Throughout this time Ann and I also began to drift further and further apart. About a month ago she called me to tell me she and John split up, that he wanted to try to work things out with his kids\u2019 mother. I am struggling because I do not agree with Ann\u2019s choices throughout this whole saga. But, it\u2019s not like she DID anything directly to me to hurt me or was a bad friend.

Long story short, the two of us couldn\u2019t work out a problem and we stopped being best friends, we never stopped caring.\nThis text brought on me an onslaught of emotions, and I searched the Internet for some direction and advice. \nI found this article and it really comforted me in a way. \n\n-\n\nThe reasons you've lost touch may surprise you.\nBY JACK BUSCH\nYou\u2019ve seen the Facebook posts.\n\n\u201cHey everyone! I\u2019ll be in town around Christmas for one week. I\u2019ll be busy the whole time with family except Thursday between 3:30 PM and 8:00 PM. Text me if you want to hang. I want to see YOU!\u201d\n\nA few friends like the post. Maybe one or two guys chime in: \u201cI\u2019ll be in town, too! Let me know if you want to hang out.\u201d\n\nBut then it never happens. The vague sentiments of wanting to meet up never really materialize into actual plans.\n\nWhat gives? Is it pure logistics? Are we really that busy? Or is it that everyone enjoys the idea of hanging out with old friends more than they actually like doing it?\n\nTurns out it\u2019s both. But being unable or unwilling to make time to get drinks over the holidays is indicative of something else: the slow fade of old friendships.\n\nThis is the Age When We Start to Lose Friends\n\nLosing touch with old friends can feel tragic. Maybe even shameful. It feels like you\u2019ve left a garden untended and it\u2019s withered from neglect. But in reality, it may be more normal than you think.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a recent scientific study that took a look at how many friendships we maintain as we grow older. For both men and women, there\u2019s a certain age when the number of friends we have peaks. That age? Twenty-five. After that, friendships start to decline.\n\nTo get those numbers for the study, they analyzed mobile call detail records. Previous studies show that the frequency of phone contact\u2014that is, actual phone calls, not SnapChats or Facebook reactions\u2014correlate with how often we see family and friends face-to-face. These tend to drop off significantly as we move deeper into our 20s and 30s.\n\nPart of this is pretty obvious. This is the age when men and women tend to marry and settle down with jobs and kids. It\u2019s a simple matter of time budgeting\u2014you no longer have the time or energy to hang out.\n\nBut the study highlighted another interesting phenomenon that explains the dynamics of who makes the cut when you downsize your social circle.  Apparently, there\u2019s some order to the slow fade of friendships.\n\nYou Met Me at a Very Strange Time in My Life\n\nThe best way to understand why you lose friends is to first understand why you made friends in the first place.\n\nSo, if you don\u2019t mind, please take a step into my time machine. Reach over to that dial on the right\u2014yeah the one with the hourglasses and alarm clocks on it\u2014okay, now crank it back to \u201c10 years in the past.\u201d Now, push the big white button with the black spiral on it. Yeah, no, you gotta hold it down for a few seconds to\u2014whoooaaaaaa!!!\n\nOh man where are we? I can\u2019t see anything, but I can hear something on the college radio station. Is that The White Stripes \u2013 Blue Orchid? No, wait it sounds more like Arcade Fire\u2019s Neighborhood #2 (Laika). I think I just heard someone do a Borat impression. And is it just me, or does it feel like someone just took out a NINJA mortgage?\n\nOh yeah, it\u2019s all coming into focus now. We\u2019re in 2006. And look, there\u2019s the high school we both graduated from! Let\u2019s take a look inside.\n\nYep, there\u2019s the locker room where you got your ass kicked by Billy Hannigan after your made fun of his skinny ankles. Remember how we got wasted that weekend and buckled a dead racoon into his backseat for revenge? That was disgusting, we were so stupid. That was the year when you lost your virginity to that manager at Burger King, right? I\u2019m 100% sure that\u2019s why you lost your job there, man. She told everyone that it was the most awkward thing to happen to her. I don\u2019t know why she kept calling you all summer.\n\nYou get the idea. A lot happens to you between the ages of five and 25. And you form incredibly strong bonds with the people who were there when it happened. It\u2019s a bit like having a war buddy. It\u2019s all about the shared experiences.\n\nThere\u2019s another thing, too, about being a teenager and making friends. When you are young, you are what the scientists in the losing friends trend study call \u201csocially promiscuous.\u201d  They say:\n\n\u201c[This] could be interpreted as a phase of social sampling in which individuals explore the range of opportunities (both for friendships and for reproductive partners) available to them before finally settling down with those considered optimal or most valuable.\u201d\n\nSounds a little sociopathic put in cold language like that, but it\u2019s really not. When you are in your adolescence, you are on a journey of discovery to find out not just what kind of people you like, but what kind of person you are like. This is true whether you know it or not.\n\nAnd then here\u2019s what happens:\n\nThe year when your dad went into the hospital, turns out you were really into The Cure then and so was that girl in shop class. She was awesome.\n\nAnd then remember when you got accepted into Villanova, but you were on the outs with your best friend at the time? Who\u2019d you tell instead?\n\nAnd isn\u2019t it funny that after all those phases and feuds and shifting of friends in your social circle, your best bud by senior year was still that dorky kid who was your bus buddy in 4th grade?\n\nold friends - friendship fading\n\nAs significant and special and magical as your close friendships can feel, how they came to be is truly chaotic. To a large degree, it\u2019s just a matter of who was there when the big thing happened to you. Who answered the phone that night when you were freaking out. Who high fived you when you scored that touchdown.\n\nWhat\u2019s strange and beautiful about all that is that you end up being friends with people who might be very different from you. You might not have the same interests, values, or socioeconomic backgrounds as them. But you are in this together, so damn it, you\u2019re friends.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Normal people aren't friends with someone for years, to then try to destroy them at the first signs of hardship. Friends believe the best of each other, they talk things out if there is confusion, they try to work through any bumps in the road. Obviously if you chose to be friends with someone, they have qualities you like and admire that line up with your own likes. All of this and much more is how and why I chose a friend. I saw something in you that I truly liked and admired. I believed you were a great person on the inside, I admired all you endured and all you accomplished. When you started acting differently, I excused your behavior. When you lashed out and verbally abused me, I made excuses. I shared my deepest secrets, as did you. I trusted you with my life, literally. And in the blink of an eye, you not only threw away the friendship we formed, you set out to destroy me. You told my secrets, and you told your own lies, you turned people against me. You set out to destroy innocent people you know I'm good friends with, making them lose their job...all for what?? You are the most disgusting human being I have ever known. I have cried so many tears. I have loved you through the most horrendous things you have said and done. Kept my mouth shut, never wanting to justify being that horrendous of a person back to you, by following in your footsteps. Now I'm past the tears, and now I've moved on to the numbing part. I learned a lesson I have heard is learned by every single human sole at 1 time or another. I forgive you, but I will never forget. One day you will see the damage you have done, and you will ask for forgiveness. I will give that to you, but never will you gain my friendship back. And although I will forgive you, I will tell my story to everyone, so they will know what they are dealing with. God will take care of you. I pray everyday for God to right the wrongs, and deal with you in the way He sees fit. Inside me, I hope He decides to give you a taste of your own medicine and then some, just so you can truly understand the extent of the damage you have made. I hope this is something you regret terribly, and when you do, that feeling never goes away. You destroyed something great, something you can never restore. You destroyed a true friendship.

Obviously I took the responsibility of catching him up because \u201cthat\u2019s just what friends do\u201d.\n\nAnyways, after class I decided to call first because it was a lot of information and didn\u2019t want to overwhelm him with paragraphs of text and if he had any questions he could ask me then. He did not answer the call he just texted me \u201cwhat\u201d instead. Whatever, so I texted him the rundown of assignments and how we had gotten a field trip form that was dire to our first big project. I made sure to pick up an extra form for him and sign it since we all also needed a peer signature.\n\nHe didn\u2019t reply for a long time which made me feel really shitty and I was kind of mad that I ran around taking pictures of the assigned homework, catching him up and staying after to class to talk to the professor to see what my friend could do about the homework that was due today. Eventually he replied with \u201cgracias\u201d but for some reason I still felt stupid for doing the favour in the first place.\n\nMoving forward to today, I texted him if we could meet up briefly tomorrow to give him the signed form to give to the professor. Since the professor instructed me to tell my friend to come in Monday to hand it in. And goddamn it he doesn\u2019t reply, so I provide an alternative and you guessed it, nothing. This is on Instagram and the app tells me when he\u2019s online. He\u2019s ignored some texts before in the past (I don\u2019t even text him often, once a week max) but none of them were important. Just me asking if he wanted to play Smash Bros online mostly so I took the silence as a no. But this? This is stressing me the hell out, if he doesn\u2019t hand in this stupid form it will damage his grade. Idk what to do at this point I can only hope he takes it upon himself to just go in Monday and sign a new form there.\n\nSorry if this was so long. For a little history, he never up front asks for favours, I do them on my own accord and they are usually always school related. So it\u2019s not like he\u2019s taking advantage of me. I feel like he\u2019s never do the same for me but I remember when I first started college and how the results of missing work made me feel so can\u2019t help but not want him to have that same experience", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

FIRST OFF, I NEVER took any photos like this before. Ever, in my life!

He tried everything to get her to dislike him but she didn\u2019t care. Anyways, she once said that she didn\u2019t like Edward &amp; Penelope\u2019s friendship bc she was jealous. But later, she said she was over him. And that was while Edward and I began getting close. And eventually began dating. Anyways, Penelope told us to not tell Victoria and Victoria found out bc Edward told her and she was upset we didn\u2019t tell her, we tried to explain, she didn\u2019t care. Anyways, they stopped asking me to hang out and instead of using me for rides (as they even told me, \u201churry up and get your license so you can drive us around\u201d &amp; get this, we\u2019re ALL in community college) they went to Penelope\u2019s older sister.

While I try to spend as much time as I can rectifying said situation, I find myself failing more often than not - this can be/can not be part of our talks as much as you prompt, really.\nI am fascinated by languages and linguistics, and I like mythology, philosophy, logic, history and maths, and have a growing interest in computer science (or, better put, I am interested in most topics, but have limited time and energy). I have read and practiced at things related to all of these a little, but because of poor functioning, I just can't keep up with anything how others seem to. It's not that I lack intellectual agility; during moments of clarity I am fine, and most of my friends over the years have been formed around discussions about these topics. \nWhen I am doing well I usually spend my time language learning, with family/pets, hiking, reading, talking, conlanging, writing, and studying a lot of stuff that I have no immediate requirement to study. But I don't find time for any of this lately, or even time to do the minimum required to be doing OK in my studies. I always have some type of music playing.\nI do have a high interest in sociology and politics, but I dislike how many people approach these topics (partly because I have realised that I also do the same mistakes). I am happy to criticise/be criticised in this regard. ", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Then on November 2017 she found me on Instagram and asked me if i would like to meet up since our college towns are close yet she never made good on her promise, yes she visited my college town twice and never told me i only saw her photos on social media the first time and the second i saw her standing a few lines before me at a Food Festival i had gone to as a way to cheer me up after my grandma's memorial and i saw her, her presence caused me such a distress, just thinking i would see her again made me anxious and afraid to the point i would get anxiety attacks at the thought that we would meet and feel depressed and worried about why all of a sudden wants to meet after not talking to the point i wouldn't be able to sleep at nights. On November 2018 i asked her if and when she will make good on her promise and she told me the week before christmas she will come, she never did.\n\nSo my question is how do i stop obsessing over my ex best friend and allow myself to trust people and connect with them without the nagging feeling that they will turn out to be just like her? I think i've made the first step by allowing myself to bond with Zorzet and keep touch with Maria and few more people throughout and after High School although my fear hasn't allowed me to trust new people in my college town after the recent events with my ex best friend...\n\nI want to be free of suspicious thinking and doubting that i don't deserve to have trustworthy friends that might last me a lifetime. \n\nAny ideas?\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We are great friends and I love her to bits (as a friend). Sometimes she can be a bit of a pain in the ass but so can I.\n\nOne thing about my friend is she is not the politest person in the world. Some times if I do stuff for her I don't even get a thank you which is kind of annoying. In the 4 or so years we have been friends. We have had a handful of arguments like all friends do. Yet it's always me who ends up saying sorry to get us speaking again even though I was not the one in the wrong.\n \nRecently I have been feeling a little underappreciated by my friend. She has asked me to help her out with a few things recently which I gladly helped out with. I was helping her reorganize her flat moving stuff around ect. \n\nShe started getting a little tired and frustrated as a the flat looked a little clutted than it did before the re-arrangement. I decided I needed a 15 minute break and after 5 she somewhat lashed out at me and called me lazy. This pissed me off but I didn't say anything. A few minutes later I was still annoyed and a little upset so I just made an excuse that I needed to go. \n\nFast forward today I'm still a little annoyed by the way she lashed out at me. But I'm obviously not going to end out friendship over it. However I do want to make her realise that she can't just talk to people like that especially ones that are giving her a helping hand. As of writing I have had no apology from her but she did text me to see what I was up to half hour ago. I have not replied and I I'm not sure I want to just yet. \n\nNow if I know my friend as well as I think I do. I think she realises that she upset me but does not want to admit it and hopes it will blow over quickly. So what do the people of Reddit think? Should I ignore her for a day or so and see if she apologizes? \n\nAs I said I love my friend. I would just tell her that she annoyed/offended me but she will most definitely say she was joking ect. \n\nEdit: Thanks for the comments I have a update. She called me today to ask how I was. So I told her I'm fine but was a little annoyed by what she said. \n\nShe knew what I was talking about and as expected she tried to tell me she was joking. So I told her joking or not you don't say things like that to people who has taken time out of their day to help you out. She agreed and said she was sorry.\n\nSo that is the end of the issue. I have one more question. How do I ago about asking her to he a bit more polite? I'm not asking her to sing my praise every time I help her or something for it but a quick thanks would be nice. I think it might be a bad idea brining it up out of the blue. Do you guys/girls think it might be best to wait until the next time I do something for her and don't get a thanks? Maybe just say something oh your welcome or a thanks would be nice? Or is that to sarcastic? ", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm always looking for new recommendations though and I'm pretty open to film.\n\nI love sports but being British you can probably guess where this is going.

So here's a little about me, enjoy reading! \n\nI am in my twenties, girl, living in Prague, Czech republic. I love to talk with people from various backgrounds, of all ages, genders, colours etc. Although I am pretty young, I've already lived through some shit and I have many stories to tell. Worry not, we don't have to go too deep into serious topics though! \n\nAlso, I am looking for great, wholesome friends, not romantic relationships. Please don't try to hit on me, thanks! \n\nSo, what do I like and like to talk about? \n\n1) Music and movies \nI am a sucker for embarassing music, specially 90s pop and r'n'b. You know, Backstreet boys, Nelly, Vengaboys etc. I listen to gangsta rap for encouragement, video games sountracks for relax and emo for reminiscing about my childhood. Yes, I am former cringey emo kid with black nails and Emily Strange merch.\n\n2) PC games \nI play different game genres. I'd say that survival is my most favourite type of games, but I also enjoy strategy, horror or adventure. Btw if there is someone who is willing to play Dota with me, let me know (I've played like twice and I suck at it, so...)\n\n3) Nostalgia \nI am nostalgic as hell. I collect Nintendo consoles and games (Pok\u00e9mon being my favourite of all times), stickers, postcards, all that stuff. I sometimes buy things I desperately wanted as a child, like Motorola flip phone, without actually using it. I'd love to exchange postcards with people from all over the world! \n\n4) Harry Potter \nI grew up reading Harry Potter and it sort of became my obsession. I take my Hogwarts house very seriously (I am Ravenclaw) and for several years, I play RPG Hogwarts game. I'm not ashamed! \n\n5) Memes \nWholesome, dank, deep fried and yes, sometimes normie memes. Twitter screenshot is not a meme! \n\n6) Internet culture \nIt's such a weird place right? I am happy to witness the growth and increasing influence of internet and it really amazes me. I love to binge watch conspiracy theories, weird videos, genius videos and all that! \n\nYou can talk to me about anything - work, family, travel, hobbies.. \nI am looking for some long term, preferably life long friendships. I find twenties to be very confusing, lonely time of my life and I'm trying to surrender myself with interesting, complex and genuine people. \n\nSo, wanna talk? :) \n\nBtw, deep, self defining shit here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYy0o-J0x20", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

BUT I've noticed an ongoing trend/pattern that really gets me down. This friend will regularly tell me things she's doing; social things that she just does not extend an invite. It's not like it's a date. It's not a show where there are tickets involved. I'm talking just going to a bar or whatever, something casual. \n\nLike I said; when I have something in mind that's fun to do I always think of my friends I know and extend this offer to them. I can't always expect others to do what I myself do, but it would be nice to see this kind of reciprocity and wonder why it is not the case. \n\nJust to give one example (one of many); this friend had signed up for a class that sounded really fun to me. I was very encouraging to my friend about this as I thought she'd get a lot out of it. She did not ask me to do this with her and that was totally ok. I did not expect her to. I figured perhaps this was just something she wanted to do on her own and that was totally cool and understandable. A couple of weeks into the class she was telling me all about it and how much she enjoyed it. Again I told her I was very happy for her (and genuinely was). Then she tells me in the same conversation that she was at a bar and struck up a conversation with someone at the bar who seemed really cool. She told me that she invited this person to take this class with her. This was not a date or someone she had a romantic interest in. It was just a random person she met. So my whole theory that this was just something she wanted to do on her own was blown. It was ME she did not want to include for whatever reason. \n\nWho knows? Maybe she thinks i'm lame. Maybe she doesn't think me being there would add any value, be fun...and yet she spends all kinds of time with me. This is a weird thing to bring up and I would have zero idea what to say. But it's ongoing and bums me out. \n\nLast I'll say; I would feel extremely weird telling a good friend about things I'm doing if it was within reason for me to extend this invite to them too. I would likely just keep it to myself to avoid hurting their feelings or causing them to feel left out. But maybe it's just me. ", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Considering how anti-social I was before adulthood, this does not bode well for me.\n\nI'm in my late twenties, working a job which doesn't really endear me towards my coworkers on more than a casual level, and I am by nature a solitary person. My interests include comics, fiction, movies, and food (I'm so unique, I know!). I could spend a whole day reading, writing (okay, I *wish* I had the attention-span to spend that long writing), or watching stuff on the internet, but the problem is I often find that when I do that for too long I get lonely. In the past I've tried solving this via online dating. Online dating is a terrible way of making friends, I've found.\n\nI've tried going to meetup groups, but I don't get on easily with groups of people I don't know. I also live in a townhouse out in the middle of nowhere, so any meetups necessitate me travelling to DC (which isn't close enough for comfort). All of this makes meeting new people difficult for me, and as a result I don't have the energy or the patience to pick a person or people to be friends with (which coincidentally is probably why I've been single all my life, among other reasons).\n\nWith that said, would anyone in the DC area be interesting in hanging out? I'm fine with either male or female (or non-binary) friends, with the understanding that I'm only looking for friends. With that said, I'm not opposed to friendships which turn into something more (in fact I'm convinced this is the only way I will escape being single), but this caveat applies to women only and is in no way an excuse to be creepy on my part (I sure hope that all sounded as not-terrible in text as it did in my head).

I'm looking for people to talk to, the end goal being to make a long term friend or two. I understand this isn't always possible so I am doing this without expecting anything.

I'll try to summarize and tell you some things I feel you should know if you want to get in touch!\n\nI am introverted and I mostly stay at home. I find it's way easier for me to have one on one conversations because I can put more focus on the person I am interacting with. I try to be as honest and as fair as possible without being rude/insensitive. I also have a tendency to ramble a lot if I'm passionate about a certain topic or conversation.

I avoid anything I could get addicted to (I have nothing against it it's just not for me) and I try to exercise occasionally. I mostly do cardio, (I have a jumping rope) bicycle riding and running. Sometimes I will check tech news or tech magazines, but majority of my Internet time is spent watching videos, listening to music or reading. I'm thinking about getting into photography and photo editing.\n\nI'm vary this is personal but I think my friends should be aware of it. I'm gay. I promise I won't bother you with it unless it's a topic you are willing to have. English is also not my first language and I would love to learn another one, at least to a conversational level.\n\n*Final note for those that came this far: In the future, I want to treat my \\[close\\] friends like they are my family, since the only way I want to go forward in life is by making good changes to it. No one said it's going to be easy nor that every day will be a good one but I want to put up a fight and live the best life possible.

I just want it to over.", "author": "litbydayclitbynight", "self_text": "I guess it'd be limited to two or three but we talk to each other once in a month or so. It's pretty much same like others- I am an introvert, have been depressed for quite a long time which has decreased my productivity, fucked up my studies and increased my libido (idk if that sounds weird). My taste in music is different from people around me, I play only the CS:GO game, read books but suck at writing and if I have to speak (presentation in class or a similar activity) it makes me cry (idk why). For the last seven years people have been making fun of me and even I make fun of them but somewhere I don't know why I get hurt when they don't really intend to hurt me. \n\nAlso I cannot fight back. It's the worst quality I've. I mean why the fuck in hell and heavens can't I just fight back and hurt people. This world deserves the storm that it gets. I know being too nice is just going to crush me. I try to man up ( I think that's the word) but I fail. I fail miserably every single time I try to do that. \n\nAnd it's one of the reasons I don't want to be committed to someone or get married and rejected even the ones who loved me. Because I have to provide the girl/women safety, save and rescue her from the demons but how do I guard someone else when I can't do it for myself ? How do I fight someone else's devil when I can't fight my own ones ? And besides that I don't earn so I can't take her out for a lunch or dinner date and shopping ( I mean women love shopping) or surprise them. \n\nPretty much same with the friends. I can't fight for a friend and what kind of a friend would I be if I don't fight for him and help him when he need me? Why would someone befriend me when he knows I won't be able to help him in the bad times ? You can't just be with him only when it's the happy times. Friends share happiness and help in crisis. \n\nAnd I'm doing nothing to make my life better but writing this stupid post which some of you who I won't ever come across are going to read ( or maybe not as it's too long). \n\nMoreover I don't look good either. And as if that's not enough, I'm an empath. My MBTI type is INFP. So you can imagine now how much I can feel and overthink. Even the tiniest bit of a shit which shouldn't even matter to me would burn a hole in my heart. \n\nAnd the mother of all of this \u2013 I'm cursed with being able to fuck up any situation or conversation in like 2 seconds flat. \n\nI know life is beautiful. I have a zest for it. But it doesn't seem to get better and by the time it'd get better, I guess it'd be too late. I'm just holding on to it for my parents. I know that all they have is me. And so I just want to give them every moment of happiness and joy that they deserve. I just want to be here until they're here making sure it's peaceful.

Pretty unexciting, to be honest - wallowing in different shades of blue moods, stressing about the future and planning on dumping over 400$ on a plate carrier, because reasons  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af  \n\nIn any case, here is some basic info (AKA full autobiography) about me:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian fluently.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate.\n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned career, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, which I am dealing with as best as I can - although recently, things have been on the mend - enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n- Living with my parents for financial convenience - yay! :D\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am somewhat stigmatized against the latter by a some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not in fact a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandise and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed. \n\n- Gainfully *un*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work.\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Auromata, WoW, DOOM, Bioshock, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. Honestly, for whataver reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nRight now, I am alternating between Sunless Skies (I've been waiting for that game for over a year now) and Arma III.\n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favorite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favorite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loath cheap jumpscares they are so enamored with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \nThis is where Darkwood comes in nicely!\n\n- My sense of humor is possibly the worst, and I have dank memes ready for every possible situation and I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile humor. \n\n- My main hobby right now is Airsoft. I spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together, since I ordered most of my gear from companies in Russia. I guess I really prefer quality, which is why I was willing to fork over money for real military stuff instead of more affordable replicas.  But at least the gear is quite nice and looks good. \n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I think it is time to give up trying to categorize what I like by genre, and instead do it by what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord) I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \nRight now, I am super into Ghost. \n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%, due to a certain affinity for slithering neck-ties, ambitions and ruthlessness. \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. That goes for stuff like lack of grammar and improper punctuation to short and generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit.\n\nI prefer using Discord over anything else, but I like to get to know people on here before jumping in there. Please no Reddit Chats, I hate the UI. \n\nFeel free to hit me with your favorite ice breaker / shower question! (As long as it is not a Trotsky ice pick). \n\n\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I recently got out of a relationship that meant a lot to me, and I'm still trying to rediscover who I am outside of it and find more people to keep me company, and vice versa.\n\nIdeally I'd just like to talk to someone mature, kind and consistent (though age doesn't matter to me). Someone who will always be around and hopefully eager to talk. I'd like to feel included and like I matter to someone, so hopefully if you're thinking of messaging me, you're okay with forming a close, long term friendship. Some of my interests include sharing music, gaming/comics/nerdy stuff, sports, history, and getting to know people. I really enjoy learning. Also, even though I'm mostly looking for someone to text throughout the day and night, it would be nice to meet someone that is open to talking on the phone once in a while. Also, age, gender, etc. doesn't matter at all, I'm super open minded so anyone reading this, I welcome your messages.\n\nI think my best qualities are my honesty, openness and patience. I've been through a lot of shit in my life and was forced to grow up quicker than I think I was ready to. I'm pretty mature, but I definitely have a playful, \"childish\" side that loves joking around, making fun of things and not taking life too seriously. I'm currently focusing on getting my life back on track, and as such\nI have a ton of free time and have for a while, so I should always be around to talk.\n\nI have a bunch of messaging apps and unlimited texting, but at this juncture I'd prefer Discord if you have it. Thank you to anyone that read through this. I hope to hear from some of you soon.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

She is in her 50s and I\u2019m in my mid 20s and we have known each other for about 8 years. She has since left work due to some serious health issues she has never been able to have children due to these issues and so she became close with me and another younger colleague and \u201cadopted\u201d us so to speak. Both of us had made an effort whenever she\u2019s been admitted to hospital, making care packages and visiting her whenever we have been free. But I have a dilemma, every time I have gone to visit her I have ended up staying at her house for 4+ hours cause she WILL NOT STOP TALKING!!!and I mean literally won\u2019t even pause between sentences!i don\u2019t even say anything during these visits she just talks and talks about mundane things that no one cares about!I feel bad saying this but it\u2019s starting to affect our friendship because when she asks me to come over to her house for a coffee i dread it because I know I will waste my whole day off at her house  listening to her talk about herself! \n\nHow do I cut these visits short? I have tried saying that I have to be somewhere at such a time and I still end up stuck there with her non stop talking!i don\u2019t want to hurt her feelings but it\u2019s really bad and makes me not want to visit her as much because I know I\u2019m wasting my whole day at her house!I also was told by another friend of hers that she gets hurt if I don\u2019t text her back straight away which annoyed me because I don\u2019t have my phone on me constantly and I do eventually text her back if I get a message from her.

Since then here are the following lies and how I've debunked them (braise yourself because the list goes on and on)\n\n- her father died before she was born and the man raising her is her 'stepfather' whom she despises. and her younger brother is her half-brother (debunked: A. She looks identical to her father.  B. She once said that her little brother gets his blond hair from \"his father\" then her brother responded with \"he's yours too\")\n\n- Jaz told me that her old sister (let's call her Dani) is transgender (from male to female). Then six months later, her sister gave birth to a child. YES, you read that correctly, this girl claims that she has a transgender sister who naturally conceived a child and pushed him out of her vagina. I decided to humour her and ask how this is possible. Her response was \"she had surgery, she now has a full female reproductive system\". Oh, wait there's more. I stalked her sister's facebook page only to find that her sister Dani has Endometriosis (a condition where tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside the uterus) and has had many surgeries to repair the damage. \n\n- Jaz says that her sister Dani has two other children (twins in fact). So I asked, \"how is this possible If she only had the 'surgery' recently?\". Her response was \"surrogacy\". (Debunked, because Dani's entire Instagram is filled with her baby boy and ZERO of these 'twins'. I also asked, \"who do these twins live with?\" And apparently, they're in England with their father)\n\n- another, she used to claim to have a personality disorder (the same one that the guy from split had) and she even had names for these people!) She soon gave up on that lie (never actually admitting to it, just letting it go). \n\nAgain, these lies have been told over the course of the 5 years that I've known here --- along with many many others. \n\nHere are some honourable mentions: \n\n- Jaz claiming that her sister Dani is divorced (debunked: when I told her that I need to interview someone single whose parents are divorced then she responds with \"interview my sister\" and I was like \"isn't she divorced\" then she shrugged and said \"they were technically never married\")\n\n- claiming that her older brother plans to purpose to his girlfriend then the next day saying that they're on their honeymoon (Debunked: when I asked: \"didn't they just get engaged?\" She was like \"...oh, I lied last time, I couldn't tell you that they got married\") \n\n- claiming that she has been diagnosed with mild depression and takes meds for it, but goes days without taking it (debunked: I've been around SOOO MANY people who are on antidepressants and if they miss a day they're sooo unwell). \n\nAnyway, does anyone have any advice on what I should do about this so-called 'friend'? I'm genuinely concerned for her mental health like I literally know no one who acts this way at the age of 17. ", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

They have stopped, stating that they trust me and understand that it\u2019s an invasion of privacy.)\n\nHe has apologized for the rape messages, but recently he asked to chat on Discord (Five days ago.*) so we can have another conversation about sex \u201cif your parents don\u2019t look through your phone anymore\u201d.\n\nThere has been another time (Before the rape comments) where A has tried to swoon me into blowing him on the bus when there was no-one else, saying that \u201cIt\u2019s not sex so it\u2019s not illegal\u201d (we\u2019re both underage where I\u2019m from so sex is in fact illegal for us.).\n\nA has also told me that he has gotten his dog to lick his dick to get off (He said he orgasmed successfully), but then told me that he has done it a long time ago.\n\nHe has told me about his kinks and fetishes and how he has over 2.5 GB of porn on his phone. I don\u2019t want to know about that kind of stuff, dude!\n\nMost recently (5 days or so ago i think?*) he told me that while I was bending over, he saw my underwear and described it to me. His description was accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel that I cannot cut A off without causing a big ruckus because of three things:\n\n1) A is in my friend-group, which totals to four people. If I somehow destroy the friendship, I will be in a sticky situation, because of awkwardness. This relates to #2.\n\n2) I and A\u2019s school schedules are similar. We share many classes together and the idea of having to sit with him throughout this seems intimidating. We also catch the same buses home. Our friend-group of four catches the same buses, and A likely won\u2019t approach if I\u2019m there. I do not want A to lose friends over conflict me and him share.\n\n3) I am in the same major classes as A, and I am in year nine. In my school, students get swapped around once every year starting from year nine. This could mean I can have A until I graduate. Additionally, me and A have 1 out of 4 Side classes**.\n\n*As of writing, the date is the fifth of February, 2019.\n\n**Music, drama, Textiles, Art, etc. Subjects relating to some form of art.\n\n\nI feel that A is not a good friend, at least not for me. His past makes me uncomfortable, and I feel he didn\u2019t learn from the rape comments experience, which is proven by him trying to re-initiate a conversation with me about sex.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

If you wanna chat about your day, or stuff you like or just wanna vent about some shit, that's all good with me. \n\nJust some basic things I'm interested in:\n\n\\-Reading - My favorites are ASOIAF books 1-3, Jon Dies at the End, Ender's Game and The Road. I tend to like sci-fi/fantasy as well as horror and comedic works.\n\n\\-Films - Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil, Guardians of the Galaxy, City of God and Empire Strikes Back. Mostly into comedy and sci-fi and a bit of horror, though I usually prefer it when horror elements are paired with another genre as well a la Evil Dead 2 or Get Out. \n\n\\-Anime- I'm really into Jojo's Bizarre Adventure right now. Parts 2 and 4 are phenomenal works and I'm loving part 5 so far. I've also enjoyed watching Hajime no Ippo, DBZ, Gurren Lagann, and Berserk.\n\n\\-Games- I'm mostly into DotA and Dragon Ball FighterZ right now but I play shooters from time to time and I'm open to getting back into them. Outside of those two games, my favorite titles are probably Uncharted 2, Dark Souls 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Gears of War 3 ( though I haven't been able to play it in years) and Persona 4. (I guess I really like sequels lol) I usually play on PC so if you wanna play some DotA games with me or wanna play some fighting games or just chill and shoot the shit on discord, I'd be happy to. \n\nIf you're looking to learn a new fighting game or get into the scene in general and want a partner I'm your man! I will say I'm not particularly good at fighting games as DBFZ is pretty much my first as well. \n\n\\-I'm also super into DnD and tabletop games, so if you're into that stuff then I'd be happy to play with ya or just talk about character concepts or our past favorite characters and their antics. \n\nI usually communicate using discord but I'm not opposed to other means.

We were both highly recognized and praised together by many and worked together every day for 4 years.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, eventually I had to leave company A but we always wanted the opportunity to work together again. We have always kept in touch as our friendship was more than just being coworkers.  \n\n\nLast year Bob was thinking about leaving and going to company B. He reached out to me and asked if we wanted to work together again and be the dynamic duo. Of course I said yes. When I started interviewing with company B, I told them I was only interested if Bob joined. Bob eventually decided not to move forward.  \n\n\nNow 2019, I'm thinking about leaving and going to company C. Of course, I reached out to Bob. He seemed optimistic. I had gotten a job offer from company C (time bound as usual) and asked Bob if he was serious about joining me because I know he just got promoted at company A. I told him I wouldn't accept the offer unless Bob would eventually join too. Bob agreed, so I accepted the job offer. Bob continued through the interview process, but was super flaky. We kept in touch through the process and he often had to \"reschedule\". I continued to promote and pump him up with company C saying how great of a guy Bob is and how Bob is serious about joining. Eventually, but very slowly, he was down to the final rounds. I double checked with him a couple days before his final rounds to make sure he was serious and he assured me he was. He even asked me for prep material and I spent time writing a long email to prepare for him.   \n\n\nThis is where the red flags started...\n\n* As I said, I sent him a long email to help him prep. By default in my Gmail, I have an email tracker (see when people open/read your email). He opened my email once the day I sent it to him, and never again.\n* Today is 1 day supposedly after his final rounds. I called him last night, he didn't pick up. I texted him today, he never responded. Bob is a very direct/open/responsive person, and this has me very concerned.\n* Lastly, selfishly, my reputation is at stake with company C since I vouched for Bob. Also, Bob not joining definitely makes me reconsider (even though it's too late)\n\nFor those saying\n\n1. Why don't I just check with company C? I haven't officially started, but of course when I start I could\n2. Maybe Bob is afraid to say no to me? As I said, Bob is a super direct/open/responsive person so that's not him\n\n//end rant.

I hope that I\u2019ll be able to make friends here because that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m looking for. I actually really suck at introducing myself, but I\u2019ll give you 15 fun facts about me and hopefully one of those facts grabs your attention, first things first though my name is BreAnna.\n\n\\~ Here\u2019s my top 15 commencing \\~\n\n1. I love to write, but my preferred writing style is either poetry, or screenplays. I absolutely love poetry and writing me a good poem is probably the way to my heart, besides food.\n2. I like every type of music pretty much except country, you can try to change my mind, but I highly doubt that you\u2019ll be able to. I really can\u2019t stand country music though, so sorry.\n3. I have a little puppy named Malachi, who is an absolute sweetheart and I\u2019m a huge dog person. I don\u2019t really like cats because they\u2019re usually mean to me and quite fickle. Hopefully I\u2019ll meet a cat that changes my mind though.\n4. I really love movies and I\u2019m a huge film buff, that\u2019s actually what I want to go to college for and I\u2019m super excited to go pursue my dreams of studying film. My favorite aspects of films are the colors used and the dream one day is to be a successful director. I also really like horror flicks and psychological thrillers, so if you know any good ones, please share them with me.\n5. I love food like most people and because of that I love to cook and bake. Trying out new recipes is one of my favorite things to do to pass time. So, if you have any good recipes you should share them with me.\n6. Literature is another passion of mine and I\u2019ve recently been on a binge read of \u201cthe most disturbing books ever written\u201d. What can I say? I have an affinity towards creepy stuff, which brings me to my next fact.\n7. I love conspiracy theories, so if you know any cool, or interesting ones please let me know about them, so I can have something else to obsess over. Also, before you ask I love Shane Dawson and his conspiracy theory videos, I need to watch his new video though and I\u2019ll probably do that tonight.\n8. Unpopular opinion, but I think ketchup is absolutely disgusting, so there\u2019s just a little random fact about me.\n9. One of my favorite games is Animal Crossing and I\u2019m super excited for when it comes out on the switch, I absolutely love that game - it\u2019s so relaxing and fun.\n10. I don\u2019t eat pork and no, I\u2019m not muslim. Well, I\u2019ll eat pork about once or twice a year, but I just don\u2019t really like it. Turkey is superior, you can try to change my mind, but you can\u2019t.\n11. I really like to watch youtube videos. Mostly about true crime cases, conspiracy theories, scary stories, or just the odd creepy stuff people find on the Internet.\n12. My favorite sport to watch is basketball and call me bandwagon fan all you want, but I love Lebron James and I think he\u2019s a great guy on and off the court.\n13.

Who knows, we may still click?\n\n\\- I play vidya games (It's a unique hobby, I know.) Mainly on PS4 (I have *most* recent games), so if you have a PS4 and want someone to play with hmu fam. But I also have a big steam library which i play lots of random games on and occasionally I play shit like Minecraft and Stardew Valley if someone forces me to.\n\n\\- I study physics, math**s** and computer science... Don't know if i'd go as far to say they were interests of mine though lol. apart from physics (especially cosmology.) And I'm kinda flunking them so if you are an expert in any of those 3 subjects, please help ty.\n\n\\- I like sport, being an 18 year old male from England basically means I have to like football. It's a right of passage. But i'm aware more international folk probably don't give a shit. I enjoy any sport though, apart from golf, way too dull. Maybe when I'm 60. (no offence to golf lovers, I'm just a bit of sarcastic p.o.s)\n\n\\- I love discussions and debating. Argue with me about anything, you won't win. Pineapple doesn't go on pizza. Dogs are way better than cats. Fight me.\n\n\\- My dog, Seb (short for 'Colonel Sebastien Scruffles') is pretty much my life. He kinda looks feral (he's really ugly) but he's the cutest boyy.\n\n\\- Cliche stuff like Netflix shows (I'm not watching anything currently, any recommendations would be great!) I love a lot of music.... I just love music. I'm a big fan of hiphop but occasionally my emo-girl comes out and I start listening to punk-rock bands. I have also voluntarily listened to Ariana Grande in the past, so I even have a 12 year old girl side to me.\n\n\\- Asking questions.. I ask too many. My brain is too inquisitive for it's own good. Partly the reason why idm what sort of stuff you're into. I'll just question you about it until I'm an expert on it myself haha.\n\n\\- The Room is the best film of all time.\n\nAnyway, I'll leave my list there, I tend to ramble (if you couldn't tell.)\n\nMy only request from you is that you are over 18. I quite enjoy speaking to older people, (if you'd actually want to talk to me lmao) so don't let that put you off. Oh and please be willing to *actually* talk. I don't expect essays from people but conversations are two way. I find them hard enough as it is without having to respond to 1/2 word answers constantly, sorry :(. Also I'm always here if people need to vent about stuff but I'm a pretty awful therapist, just to warn you off. Icebreakers are hard, but please send me a brief summary of who you are. Just so we can start from somewhere other than \"Hi, whats up?\"\n\nIf you actually read all of that, you're an amazing person. I'm sorry it wasn't a powerpoint. It's 2 am, I'm tired.

About 5 weeks ago, a person with whom I had had a complicated relationship got engaged to someone he had been dating for only 2 months. While I personally thought this was pretty crazy, I thought that the right and mature thing to do would be to simply wish him well. I texted him congratulations and he responded with \"Thank you. You had the chance though.\"--in reference to my relationship with him. I felt that this was an extremely spiteful thing to say, and when I confronted him he essentially admitted that it was out of spite.\n\nSo for the next few weeks I essentially ignored him because I was so angry. Then early this week we were both at a party and he said that he and I need to meet up and talk (argue, really). A few days later I asked if he really wanted to talk, and he said just forget about it. I responded by asking him not to contact me again unless he really has to (we can never be 100% out of each other's lives due to circumstances). He got angry and called me a \"child\", but agreed not to contact me unless truly necessary.\n\nI now feel a lot of guilt and that I was too harsh, but I can't take it back and I was tired of the emotional yo-yoing he was doing to me.

The island is deserted with no other people (except for some local fisherman that occasionally visit the island). So I am looking for a fellow social anxiety/introvert like myself who would be interested in joining. I am doing it with a company that specialises in deserted island experiences and the reason I am looking for another person is because its actually cheaper if 2 people go instead of 1. \n\nThis sort of experience has been on my bucket list for a while plus I sortof want to see what its like to live like this as a trial run for doing it longer term. If you are interested PM me to chat more, I believe it would be good to at some point chat over skype just to make sure we gel a bit atleast. Having a fellow introvert to do this with is better than finding some very adventurous person IMO, we could go off and do our own things at points on the island, etc. No pressure to talk or interact too much, just experience the island.\n\nInfo:  \n- The tropical island is in Indonesia\n- You don't need to have survival experience (I don't) but you do need to be of average fitness. \n- The company has been operating for a while (since 2013) and offering these experiences on this island the whole time. They require that people doing it take enough water, dried food and place a guard on the island with you. \n- The island has 2 shacks to sleep in, and you get provided with a cooking equipment, fishing equipment, first-aid kit. But you'd need to catch fish, crabs, gather fruit and coconuts to eat or eat the dried food you bring (rice, etc.).\n- The cost is a bit expensive, 1050 Euros plus the cost of the flight to and from Indonesia. They are quoting me 2100 euros for the package. The package is for 2 people so people usually split the cost between them whereas a single person needs to pay the full cost. Note, the package includes all things except the plane to Indonesia. So it includes round trip local flights between Jakarta and the local town in Indonesia, permission using the island for our activity, round trip land/sea transfer between the local airport and the pier, survival kit (machetes, fishing lines &amp; hooks), a guard option during your stay.\n- I am planning the trip for sometime in August 2019\n- I am 32/M, you can be any age or gender.\n\nI can provide more details about me and the experience in PM.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Basically Leo told John pretty much the same things as me and was worried the girl wasn't as genuinely in love as John (plus John was quite desperate for love so he threw himself into the first girl's arms). John said something like \"C'mon don't be petty, you're not Brad Pitt but if a guy like me can find happiness, I'm sure you can as well!\" Leo said he found happiness in many other things than love and John said \"Don't lie to yourself\". He even told Leo love would come faster if he started working out (Leo's not even fat tf), and I guess he meant well but it made Leo upset (obviously). I. Am. So. Freaking. Pissed!!! Like I know if she makes him happy we should be happy for him, and we would be if he kindly explained why he trusted her this fast or for example made us meet her, but how can we when he starts acting like that? And when I read the comments under the pic of him and his gf on instagram (there's only one yet), he seems to be as arrogant he's with Leo with everyone. I was worried about the girl, now I'm worried about John. Did this ever happen to one of your friends? Did it stop??? Because if he keeps going like that his friends are gonna disappear, and he'll be like it's OK since his girlfriend is his only source of happiness, but when she'll dump him... I'm not sure I'll comfort him.\n\nTl;dr: What to do when my friend think he's better than everyone and says mean things because he made his crush his girlfriend?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

He can be very sensitive some times and it seems like the most minor of things can tick him off. We were hanging out one morning for a couple of hours and he let me use his computer while he showers and we wait for some of our friends to head over to a coffee shop. I thought I would pull a playful prank on him and change his desktop background to Brad Pitt's nude since he was showing it to a couple of our friends earlier in the day. When he gets back, and we're about to leave, I show him the desktop background and he just says, \"really?\" and tells me to wait outside. I didn't think he was very serious since it can be hard sometimes to tell whether or not he's just kidding or not. I instead sit on his bed laughing to myself as he tries to figure out how to change his desktop background back. This entire time he has this serious face on and doesn't say a word to me at all. As we walk out from his dorm and to my friends car not one word was said. As we drove to the coffee shop, he didn't say a word to me. Our friends knew something was wrong and asked and he told them that I had changed his desktop background and seemed to be upset. My friends laughed and said \"that's it? \". Now this guy is always a playful and funny guy and is used to all the pranks and memes that our friend groups pull on each other since he is usually the one pulling them. We go to the coffee shop and it's just awkward. He doesn't say a word and it's making me feel terrible because I thought I did something terrible. We ask him and he just seems bothered he says in a very non-caring voice that him being mute and upset was just an act and we were just pranking our other two friends but he didn't tell me anything so I had no idea. He also said that he didn't care that I had changed his desktop background. He goes back to being mute and a half hour passes and we ask again what's wrong. I tell him that I don't appreciate his attitude and that it's making me upset. He storms out of his seat slightly knocking the table out of the way and says he's going for a walk. This really frustrated me because he made a scene in front of the coffee shop although no one really noticed and it was super aggressive. I had never seen him like this and it made me feel like I did something wrong and it was all my fault even though he said it had nothing to do with the little prank that i pulled. He's gone for at least a half hour and by the time we have left the coffee shop because we had something to do, he comes walking back to us. He comes over to me and tells me \"listen man, I'm stressed about my health\" and says some other things that I don't quite remember. Earlier in the day when we were having breakfast with a couple of our friends, we were the ones that mentioned that he go to a doctor and get a check up because he has breathing problems that he keeps on complaining about. It was very weird how he expressed his stress since right before I had pulled the prank he was a happy go lucky camper and after he just seemed like a sack of shit which is why i took this so personally. The rest of the day he just has this attitude towards me and it felt like he was taking it all out on me. We spent the entire day together and he took a nap mid day and woke up in a much better mood compared to earlier but he was still mopey. It was not until we headed to our friends apartment since he was having a bunch of friends over that he opened up. To everyone but me. He had a few drinks and he acted normal to everyone but me. This i took very offensively and it's been on my mind for the past day. I hold our friendship very dearly but I think that this was very childish of him even if he is stressed out. I don't think the move was to take his stress out on me and our 2 other friends at the coffee shop. The reason I didn't go home after that incident was because I thought it would make things worse. I might be a bad friend for saying this but I think that him telling me \"listen man, I'm stressed about my health\" was just an excuse to hide something much larger. I don't know his entire life story but, im just not sure. There was much too much that occured the entire day to write it all down. This is already a lot.

Just having someone to talk to would be great, maybe someone who's in a similar situation.\n\nThe whole social anxiety thing actually got somewhat better in the recent months, it's easier for me to talk to people and so on, but making friends is still pretty much impossible unfortunately.

She quarrels with him constantly and they both get to a point where it\u2019s so bad he usually ends it citing the inability to live up to her expectations. The last two times this happened, he tried to cut off contact so they could end the cycle and she went Bat. Shit. Crazy. each time. \n\nShe cannot stop crying, will neglect her home and hygiene, will post incessant  \u201cwhen you love someone...\u201d type things on social media, constantly sends him emails and texts, tries to manipulate ways to see him, and talk to me about how hopeless her life is now, how he never loved her, basically a lot of self pity....

This guy is great; he's helped me with loads of things and I've known him for about a year and a half since the start of college. I'm gonna call him Fred for this. Just a quick fyi he's gay. However, I'm getting this weird feeling about him.\n\nI have a mate who got hit by this guy a few months ago (but made up afterwards). The other week I was throwing some pennies at my mate to do some work and Fred got upset with me because I threw some pennies at my mate and let my mate keep them. One thing to note is that I didn't get Fred anything for christmas because I didn't know what to get him. He had a little rant at me and I can totally see why he was upset. I have told Fred that I can't trust my mate with sensitive info (like who I like and so on) because my mate will tell his gf and I'm not too keen on his gf. Like I don't hate her, but I don't like her. Anyway, I can't help get this feeling now that whenever I'm talking to my mate and Fred is around, Fred will feel like I'm ignoring him and get upset. I have this gut feeling that Fred  is trying to get me to stop being friends with my mate, and I can sort of explain why in a bit. (sorry for the long post just gotta rant lol)\n\nThere's this girl (gonna call her Anna) in my small group of friends in college and me and her have friendly banter. Nothing too serious. In my college (and probably most others) we have these passes you need to get around the place. She will sometimes take mine and I'll have to get it back off her, no real harm done. Fred didn't used to intervene, but now he does. I feel he's become really defensive and protective of me over the past couple of weeks. Like if this Anna goes to take my pass he'll say something and at times it can be quite crude. If I were to say it, it would definitely make her uncomfortable but because he's gay it's fine? Sometimes I'll say I didn't do something when I clearly did as a joke. Anna would be like yeah you did and I'll be like no I didn't. But Fred will intervene and stick up for me. I just feel like I can't defend for myself because he is just so over protective. This has caused some issues in my friend group at times. I just don't want my other friends to think me and Fred are inseparable. He didn't bother walking to one of my lessons with me, but he now does when I feel he doesn't need to.

{"post_id": "aozm67", "created_utc": 1549764930, "title": "Unrequited Love/One-sided friendship", "author": "Estel117", "self_text": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is my first ever reddit post. Apologies in advance if I mess up. I am a male, and have known this girl for 7.5 years. We were classmates in grad school. I had a crush on her. But saw her on a couple of dates with others, nothing serious, and mostly got over the feelings. Plus she was clear she didn't want kids and I did, so I never confessed my feelings to her and let it go.\n\nWe actually were roommates for two years, but I noticed that she is a bit self-centered. She never initiated anything, ever. I chalked it down to introverted nature. In those two years as roommates, unless I made plans, we didn't even hang out together. And I felt we were good friends before that. But she preferred being by herself. During that time I never saw her date anyone or mention any guy. I had heard from other classmates that she is a prude and a bit of an asexual. Recently she has mentioned that she doesn't really miss anyone, and gets bored on most dates or with the guy after a few dates.\n\nAfter we were roommates, I didn't hear from her for two years, even though her family lived 30 mins from me. She never contacted me when she came home. Only heard from her when she wanted a job. I created a position for her and got her a job. A few months in, she said yes to going to a wedding as my plus-one since I had broken up a few weeks earlier. In that trip my feelings for her came back. Its been 15 months now. I confessed my feelings a couple of months after the wedding trip. She didn't even acknowledge what I said. She was looking down at her phone and never looked up. I had to mention it again a few weeks later and she said no. I am okay with a no, but she became cold and distant. And this is where I made a mistake. I pursued her, not being inappropriate, but treating her extra special. I am not sure what I wanted, to win her over or at least for her to treat me like a normal friend. Because in the past a friend had said no to me, but she never changed her behavior towards me and I got over the rejection quickly. But this girl, even before I told her anything, she never initiated anything. After the wedding trip she was a bit talkative, but shut down once I told her. Just like before, she would only contact me when needed anything. Myself, as a stupid man, kept treating her like a queen. I guess I needed some validation, but looking back she never really tried to be a friend. Only when she needed something from me. That's a complaint our classmates also had, and those who know her now at work do, that she seems self-centered and socially unaware. She would ignore people unless the topic interested her. And she doesn't keep in touch with anyone, unless she needs something from them.\n\nAt work it took nearly a year for her to take the job seriously and make an effort at work. Even though she said no to me, and I know she goes on about one date every 1-2 months, whenever I am with anyone else or she isn't invited, she gets jealous/angry. Once she even flirted with me via text when I was at a party where she wasn't invited. Once I had a female roommate a few months back, that's when she really started showing interest in my life and started grilling me about that girl. Over the past year she avoided one-on-one hangouts with me, but over last couple of months says yes to hanging out with me alone. I guess my pain originates because I did more for her in past 15 months than I have done for anyone. Everyday little gestures to big gestures every few months. But there was no effort on her part to even be a good friend. And the more she was indifferent, the harder I tried. But the few times I stepped back, she wanted attention, including asking me few weeks back why I don't come sit with her anymore at work. Yet I know she's talking to someone else and went on a date last week. But I am taking her out on her birthday soon, and she said keeps saying yes to hanging out with me alone. Last year she even forgot my birthday. So I am not sure what she wants. My friends/coworkers say she wants my attention to be exclusively for her. It is obvious she doesn't have feelings for me. Even though we are extremely similar, I still want kids and am not sexually prude. So I know it won't work with her long term. She doesn't get jokes, sarcasm, and snaps at people quickly. When I mention it to her she says we are all very sensitive. Only in last couple of weeks she has tried asking me about myself. Else never anything, not even a how are you, unless I initiate it. Never any interest to know about my life. The stuff we do are the stuff she likes or we mutually like. But not really an effort to do something I might like. She is quite emotionless and admits to it. So I am not sure what issue I have that I pursued someone who wasn't right for me and had no interest in me.\n\nI am trying to be a good friend, and not care about her dating others. Am trying to move on. But since her date last week she has been acting very weird. Kinda formal and short replies. I am not really sure if we can even be close friends, or how to proceed with her, as a coworker and a friend.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We tend to spew some inside jokes where we talk with random words sometimes and this may have annoyed him over time, he never directly told us in the heat of the moment if this was bothering him although it's possible he mentioned something briefly in the past. Even then, nothing was done to \"intimidate him\" and in that scenario we were just trying to chill out on a game that he agreed on playing. \n\nWhat triggered the argument? We were playing a game of F1 2018, a friend of mine crashed and said he was gonna close the game as he didn't want to spectate further since he was out of the race. I didn't leave at all but for some reason he thought we both didn't want to play with him, so he left our Discord call including the game and just started ranting on Messenger in the group chat itself.\n\nMy reaction was to pretty much tell him I'm done with his antics as this has been happening for a good year where he randomly leaves instead of communicating the problem to us. Sometimes I can get him to look at it logically and he sort of apologies but he's also great at guilt tripping so you can see where this is going. His response was for me to \"Get your own personality instead of acting like Friend A's boyfriend\" and he told Friend A (my friend) to go seek therapy as apparently \"your jokes make no sense.\" I didn't understand why he even said this because I didn't follow my friend in closing the game, I was still in the race, he just decided to leave. My friend was sending random things in the chat as he knew he goes on these emotional rants and wanted to try calm the topic down. I decided to leave the chat in order to avoid more commotion and even blocked him on all social media. I was told by my other friends that he replied with \"If you think this is about a racing game, then fuck me you're blind\" along with \"Group over sorry guys\" after I left and my friend got kicked by him. \n\nThe day after, some people from the group messaged me to figure out what was going on, I pretty much told them that he lost his cool from a racing game and that I was done dealing with his shit, to put it bluntly. They agreed he was acting ridiculous recently and to add insult to injury, one of the people in the group who he saw as his best friend ghosted him as he was getting tired coping with his issues. He thinks that he can just get people to cancel all their plans to hang out with him even if people have a job or school to deal with (he has school himself so I'm unsure what he even does with his own time). If there's a game he likes he will try getting everyone to buy it and if people hesitate he'll even offer to buy it for us to play without us needing to pay him back. This seems nice at first, but it's really just him trying to guilt us into playing with him since it would be harder to refuse then. His best friend ghosted him about 5-6 months ago? So it was mostly just him myself and my other friend talking in Discord. \n\nPersonally, I believe the friend that started all this drama is still grieving from losing a very close relative about a year ago, instead of trying to seek some counselling he seems to use us as his coping mechanism and it was getting more and more demanding. He can be a very nasty person when he wants to, I personally felt drained interacting with him recently and he loved picking on my insecurities which included not leaving the house often, supposedly not giving him time of day as I didn't play a certain game with him and basically \"wasting his time.\" One time he showed my messages to another friend of mine when I didn't show up to his birthday party, I messaged him telling him I wasn't really feeling that great to show up at that time. The truth is I didn't show up because the guy is a major hassle to deal with online yet alone in real life. I want to remind everyone he is around 21 years old and I'm 19, it's crazy that this sort of stuff is still brought up with people our age. \n\nNow, honestly I have a lot on my plate right now, I'm in a but of a rut trying to find a way to get out of it mainly things like anxiety, insecurity and so on. In no way did I have any energy to deal with his constant guilt tripping or toxicity and so I just decided to cut the friendship. At the same time, I also do not like holding grudges permanently and given his mental state I'm not so sure what to do. He apparently contacted his former best friend today on a service known as \"Revolut\" by giving him 1 cent to send him a message since he was being ignored on other stuff. The message was \"I know I was out of line, can we talk?\" \n\nWe wheren't too sure if this was referring to the friendship between him and his former best friend or if it was with the whole group. What should I do here?

One I went to college with, lived with, and still see on a very regular basis. One I've known since I was 3 years old.\n\nSo, context. \nThe breakup hit me pretty hard though. I was an awful lot more invested than they were, but neither of us really realised/acknowledged it because they were going through a lot at the time and got confused with their feelings - through absolutely no fault of their own.\n\nBut I still thought I was going to marry this person. That I'd have a happy life with my best friend. That my kids would have the best dad they could ever ask for. So it was a pretty heavy blow to lose that and to learn that I never meant even nearly as much as I thought I did.\n\nI've been up and down since then, but the last two weeks have been particularly rough. Had frequent suicidal thoughts, self-harmed almost daily. Found myself unable to hold a conversation with most people.\n\nSo, these three friends messaged between one another, asking who knew what about how I was doing etc.\nMy old college roommate and my ex were actually great and just made sure I got out of my apartment (I live alone) and had chill chats about nothing etc.\n\nBut yesterday, my childhood best friend came over with some well-intentioned advice.. But I came away feeling completely ruined by guilt. She tore into me for drawing back from people, and for saying that I'm not ready to talk about it all yet. She's been to therapists a lot too, so it's not like she doesn't understand what it's like to just feel like shit.\n\nShe refuses to acknowledge that I need to cope with things differently than she does, and was far less than delicate about getting that point across.\n\nI've known her my whole life, and I'm meant to be travelling with her soon.. But I'm starting to feel like I might not want to be as close to her anymore..\n\nI don't know how to go about dropping her though. I did try to tell her that what she was saying was hurting me, but she just thinks it's \"tough love\".\nAnd I feel like the other two would agree with her because they didn't hear the conversation. But she made me feel very small and like a horrible person for trying to process my emotions on my own, as I always have and as I know I need to before speaking to anyone else about them.\n\nI just don't really know what to do.

One of the areas in my development/lead up to that, which I would like to focus on, is my ability to coach others. I feel like I\u2019m pretty good, but I have very little practical experience doing so. Additionally, a side project I\u2019m working on will also eventually incorporate coaching/helping others (I hope). Kind of like a life coach but don\u2019t think about it like that too much, because it will differ.\n\nAnywho, because of the above, I would like to offer to help anyone I can with anything they want. Don\u2019t limit this to professional life either. I would also be down to just talk about random things and ideas and topics; username checks out - there is very little I won\u2019t be interested in discussing. If you can teach me, I\u2019ll provide good discussion.\n\nSomething I feel I should add; while I am currently studying leadership and management, I\u2019m not quite finished yet. I also possess no counselling degrees (or any degrees for that matter), so my help is not going to be expert help. I believe I, and coaches in general, offer help in a different way. A fresh perspective, someone to bounce ideas off, options maybe not considered, and the right questions asked to get to the root of the issues. I am not a progressional though; the intention here is for me to help others, to get a feel for it before it\u2019s my job.\n\nThanks for reading if you\u2019ve come this far. PM if interested or if you have questions. I have zero intention of charging or wanting anything in return at all.

In his case its hard to tell, and there have been times we have wondered if it was true or not. But now after a while it has become more obvious.\n\nSome of his regular habits have become a bit more grating recently such as:\n\n* Making lots of excuses why he is unable to do something when 9/10 times we're pretty sure its because he's just lazy.\n* Complaining about things going on in his life but never actually following through on our feedback and advice on what he can do to fix them (for example: stuck living with parents, online relationships, his YouTube 'career'). Then when he hasn't taken any action, continues to complain about them the following week.\n* Having a very fussy diet - when he comes over we are restricted to about 5 dishes we could cook, or get junk food.\n* Not taking part in activities as a group. He started playing D&amp;D with us all, now he has dropped out and plays on his phone for hours while we play (I understand this may be an Autism thing as he has a short attention span and has trouble imagining things).\n* Tries to manipulate situations to spend more time with us - Oh I left my bag at your house (so we have to go back to your place first), lets go to a movie late Friday night (oh well its so close to your house and we're meeting up tomorrow anyway, might as well spend the night).\n\nHaving the same problems week after week has become increasingly grating to the point that we sort of dread having to put up with it all again next weekend. Thing is though is that he's still a nice guy and means well, but we're loosing patience and getting snappier with him, to the point we might end up loosing it at him or end up trying to drop him from the group.\n\nOne of my other friends straight up won't arrive until there is at least one other person there and seems to be effected the most by his behavior (even recently pretended to be sick to avoid him), the others not as much but haven't known his as long and seem a little more patient with him.\n\nWhat can we do to try and salvage the friendship? Should we? We're already a relatively small group of five as it is. I don't want to ditch a friend we have known for years, (especially if some of this is beyond his control) but the feeling is that he won't change and we're delaying the inevitable.\n\nTLDR: Our friend's annoying habits have become more grating, how can I salvage this friendship?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

So I have Asperger's syndrome and I've always developed random fascinations with particular people, typically attractive ones. My current fascination is with this pretty girl who rides my bus, I think she's in 11th or 12th grade. I don't have a crush on her or anything, or at least I don't think I do (I'm a straight female, although I've lately been wondering if I'm a tiny bit bisexual)  but I think about her very often. She's rode my bus ever since I came to middle school, which was 2 years ago (I'm in 8th grade now, but the middle school and high school kids often share buses since the two schools are so close). I've seen her on a day-to-day basis for 2 years and never paid her any mind whatsoever, so I can't figure out for the life of me why she's suddenly consuming my brain now- especially since I've never talked to her and don't even know her name-but I do have a few ideas. Maybe it's because she's pretty, since like I said before the people I have fascinations with are usually attractive. It could also be because she often carries a psychology textbook around, and I've recently taken a deep interest in psychology and plan to be in the mental health field when I get older. Anyway, do you guys have any possible explanations for why this random girl I've crossed paths with every day for 2 years is suddenly taking up so much of my thoughts? Is it just because I notice we have common interests, or is it because I realize she's pretty and might have a tiny thing for her? Or is it something totally different?", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

She is currently 10 weeks so have told our close family but we\u2019re not going to tell anyone else until after the scan to be safe.\n\nThe issue we have is her friends group always try and guess when each of them are going to get pregnant meaning that if anyone isn\u2019t drinking on a night out that they automatically assume you are pregnant. We managed to avoid situations where alcohol would be involved but ended up having an event that we couldn\u2019t possibly miss. As soon as anyone saw that she wasn\u2019t drinking, they would start on her and ask if she\u2019s pregnant so what We did was bring non-alcoholic wine so that it would appear like she was drinking when she wasn\u2019t. Stupid I know but we were trying to avoid any awkward situations.\n\nAnyway, later on in the night, they are passing around shots, glasses of Prosecco, etc and my wife isn\u2019t taking any as she is fine drinking her \u2018wine\u2019 but they home straight in on this (they always drink this sort of stuff together when out). Anyway, long story short, I found out that after we left the party, they took the \u2018wine\u2019 bottles out of the recycling to check if it was alcoholic. We were unaware of this but all of a sudden we\u2019re hounded with questions of whether or not she was pregnant which we denied.  One of her friends then told us what exactly had happened so I approached one of the main perpetrators and said that I thought what they did was out of order and that if we wanted people to know our news, we would have told them. It seemed like they wanted to catch us out and almost ruin us delivering the news. I did say that it was behind us now so no point getting upset about it but they still didn\u2019t see that they did anything wrong.\n\nThey are usually a really nice group of people but this really pissed me off and don\u2019t think I am out of line??

I like sharing stuff and discovering new content together. \n\nI sometimes play games, sometimes watch movies and sometimes read books, but I often watch videos about them more so, but i'm open to suggestions that pertain to my tastes (of which you will learn).\n\nI also watch Netflix sometimes, but right now i'm hooked on Downton Abbey and I adore the aesthetic.\n\nof course, I do many things despite that, like programming and making music, but that's not something I feel I could base a friendship off of. Disregarding things like those, there really isn't that much to me apart from what I mentioned above lol. I hope to be hearing from you soon!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Sounds great right?\n\nIt\u2019s not even so much as just troubled in general. I\u2019m freaking out, I haven\u2019t been driven to the point of suicide like this since sixth grade. \n\nFirst off, I don\u2019t even know what the issue is. How do you fix a problem you can\u2019t see? Secondly, why is there an issue? I can\u2019t identify things that are plausible causes.\n\nIt could be the time of year? Everything always gets crazy around my birthday, and that\u2019s tough to handle. It could be the fact that my bestest little birdie bud died, but I\u2019ve already handled that very well, and when I think about her none of those feelings arise. Maybe it\u2019s just the fact that there\u2019s so much going on right now, with the girl and the bird and the birthday and school.

It feels like I\u2019m just doing something wrong at life but how do you do something wrong at life? I feel like to other people I\u2019m just trying to whine or grab for attention. \n\nAnother issue is I feel like I don\u2019t know who I am. Like my character is just a facade. I\u2019ve worked on a million issues before and changed so much about myself in ways I like but it feels like I don\u2019t know who I am. People say all this good stuff but does any of it really apply to the person I am? It certainly doesn\u2019t feel that way. I don\u2019t have a best friend, I just have a lot of acquaintances, and when I\u2019m near them, I\u2019m always just *there* I\u2019m never someone that someone\u2019s glad to see.\n\nIt also feel like the world around me is dying.

To start things of I want to state that I'm looking for friendships only, nothing more. Have had a few people try or bring up being more than friends. \n\nAnyway, Im 19 and I'm from the UK. I'm a huge introvert and have bad anxiety, so apologises in advance. I find it hard to go out and make friends which is why I use reddit for it. Im pansexual (not limited in sexual choice with regard to biological sex, gender, or gender identity, often get asked what is it) and I have a bf so I'm not interested in anything other than friends. \n\nThings I like:\n\n\\- Animals: I absolutely love animals. I personally own a cat and a yorkshire terrier.\n\n\\- Anime: Recently I started to watch more anime and its actually pretty good. Currently I'm watching Fairy Tail, bnha and every so often some Black Butler\n\n\\-Music: I listen to music almost 24/7. My fave to listen to are Take That and Westlife (British bands) but recently I have been listening to pretty much anything.\n\n\\- Twitch and Youtube: Basically half my life. I never really watch tv or Netflix but Twitch and Youtube is the best. The main Youtubers I watch are the Yogscast, Fitz, No0b3 and PatrckStatic. The Twitch Streamers I watch are No0b3, Vooshy, Patrck and GarukuBluemoon.\n\n\\- Gaming: The thing I do most, the other half of my life. I am super into gaming and have played a lot of games. The main games I play currently are Dbd, The Forest, Stardew Valley and HOTS. I have other games like CS:GO and Fortnite but I don't play them as often as I don't get good fps (highest 20fps)\n\n\\- Drawing: I love drawing and used to do it a lot, stopped cos I started to get sore a bit too quickly from doing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a few different platforms for talking on which I can give if you want. I'm not too fond of reddit as I rarely get notifications coming through.

Discord decides that it doesn't want to notify me sometimes, (I think I may have fixed the problem?) although I'm open for using it if that's your preferred method of communication. Too anxious to voice chat, but I can after we know each other.\n\n\n\n\nBasic info \n\nName: Trey\n\nAge: 19 (almost 20 in a few weeks)\n\nGender: Male\n\nTimezone: EST (UTC -5)\n\n\n\n\nInstead of talking about my interests, I'm deciding to mix it up and talk about my strengths and weaknesses. Since they will affect our friendship, as yours will too. \n\n\nStrengths: \n\nListening. I am someone who will listen to what you have to say, and will do so with an open mind. I refuse to invalidate your feelings. Any secrets, taboos, suffering, achievements, questions, rantings, rambling chains of thought, etc. I will listen to you and will not judge you on it. The only exception, is if you deliberately and repeatedly harm an innocent person. Hopefully you'll listen to me too. I don't want to be JUST your vent, where you vomit all your thoughts, then leave, then only come back to vomit some more. \n\nUnderstanding. I will not force you to do anything. If we're talking about something, and you want to change the subject, ask. If you're late at responding because of work, I understand, life happens. If you're in a bad mood and need to rant, I understand, and it's okay. This applies to most things, as long as you give me an honest reason, I will accept it. Life gets in the way, and I don't expect instant responses 24/7. Bad days happen, it's okay to not be happy. I'm a pretty chill guy. \n\nNo creepy business. Girls feel free to contact me since I'm gay, so no dick pics or niceguy behavior here. Guys don't need to worry about that either, cuz I'm not even looking for love/sex.\n\n\nWeaknesses: \n\nEscapism. My brain doesn't like me most of the time, so I tend to leave reality to escape my pain. Sadly, reality includes you. Getting a text usually snaps me out of it, but I'm very VERY bad at texting first. This WILL be an ongoing problem, and it doesn't mean that I don't care, or don't want to talk. It's just something I struggle with. I'm working on it, but it can last for days, and I'm hoping you can pick up the slack by initiating contact most of the time. I will not ghost though, if things aren't working out, I will tell you so instead of ignoring/blocking you.\n\nChildish worldview. I'm not saying I can't be serious, technically I'm about 50/50 for serious and joking. It's more about responsibility, I hate it. Every adult obligation, is what I'm lacking. No work, no schooling, no license, nothing. It frustrates some people, when I flake out of appointments or complain about how the world is. Not to mention, it might affect how relatable my life is compared to yours. Our victories, our hardships, they might be on different levels. \n\nThis one is last because it can be a strength and a weakness. I tend to give advice, a lot. I don't EXPECT you to take it, but it may be invalidating and annoying if I give you a \"solution\" you already thought of. When I see people in pain, or them struggling with an issue, I want to help, to stop them from feeling that pain. This is where the advice comes in, I'm hoping that maybe I find a solution you haven't thought of, that might help you. \n\n\n\nRequirements: \n\n1. You need to at least TRY to communicate. If you don't know how, one word answers usually stop communication. \"Cool, k, lol, nice, nah, yep.\" There's no real way to respond to these. Sending ONLY memes/pictures/emojis isn't conversation either. If you don't know what to say, ask questions, or just say \"idk how to respond.\"\n\n2. I'd rather not be ghosted, as it sucks. If you want to stop talking, just say so. Trust me it won't hurt my feelings and I won't hate you for doing so. Sometimes people don't click, and I'm okay if you decide that you don't want to talk anymore. \n\n3. Use kik or discord. (Reddit chat might work but I've never tried it before.)\n\n\n\nIf you read this far, congratulations and thank you for allowing me to take up some of your time. All ages, genders, sexualities and races are accepted.\n\nIf you feel like you wanna talk to me, send me a message about your biggest strength and weakness. Hopefully we can be friends! \n\n\nAs long as this sentence is at the bottom here, this \"advertisement\" is still valid. ", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Thank you!* :) \n\n\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info (AKA full autobiography) about me:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian fluently.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate.\n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned career, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, which I am dealing with as best as I can - although recently, things have been on the mend - enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n- Living with my parents for financial convenience - yay! :D\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am somewhat stigmatized against the latter by a some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not in fact a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandise and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed. \n\n- Gainfully *un*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work.\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Auromata, WoW, DOOM, Bioshock, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. Honestly, for whataver reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nRight now, I am alternating between Sunless Skies (I've been waiting for that game for over a year now) and Arma III.\n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favorite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favorite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loath cheap jumpscares they are so enamored with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \nThis is where Darkwood comes in nicely!\n\n- My sense of humor is possibly the worst, and I have dank memes ready for every possible situation and I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile humor. \n\n- My main hobby right now is Airsoft. I spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together, since I ordered most of my gear from companies in Russia. I guess I really prefer quality, which is why I was willing to fork over money for real military stuff instead of more affordable replicas.  But at least the gear is quite nice and looks good. \n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I think it is time to give up trying to categorize what I like by genre, and instead do it by what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord) I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \nRight now, I am super into Ghost. \n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%, due to a certain affinity for slithering neck-ties, ambitions and ruthlessness. \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. That goes for stuff like lack of grammar and improper punctuation to short and generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit.\n\nI prefer using Discord over anything else, but I like to get to know people on here before jumping in there. Please no Reddit Chats, I hate the UI. \n\nFeel free to hit me with your favorite ice breaker / shower question! (As long as it is not a Trotsky ice pick). \n\n\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

It should be more than 6 years now. I love her, no doubt. Our friendship has been based on trust. \n\nShe and a guy were in a relationship for more than a year. He cheated on her. You can tell how bad the break up was. After high school she went for studies in the US, this guy and I, we went to France but we don't even talk for years. I used to have a crush on him back in our first days in high school but it only last for like 2 weeks then went away quickly, each has it's life. I have had some relationships with other guys and he was with my best friend. \n\nI just talked back to him recently via our mutual friend. You can imagine that the community is quite small so we all are one each other's friend. We uploaded pictures of our trips, our dinners with our mutual friends on social media. It started innocently so I didn't really care. My best friend called me and reminded me that he cheated on her. I'm pretty sure it's a warning, but don't know how I should interprete it. She is now in a happy relationship with a guy and He just recently ended a 3 years relationship with another girl. So I was like \"nah, don't worrrry\" to my best friend. \n\nAnd yep, things get complicated when I started to feel something for him, not sure that he feels the same way but that's not even the question. Honestly, a part of me really hopes that he also likes me but hurting her is the last thing on earth I want to do. Clearly that's not avoidable in this situation cause hiding it from her is not even an option. He's getting sweeter and sweeter day by day.

I think it's nice to imagine what we could do together, but he feels it's just disappointing and would rather not. Sometimes I feel like we should just break off the friendship if this separation is really such a big deal to him. He would be better off just cutting me out since it just pains him not to be able to see me. I need advice!\n\nBackstory: Ok so I am a young woman, age 23. I have a friend, a guy, also 23. Let's call him Ben. Ben and I dated shortly when we were in high school, but eventually broke up and stayed friends. He's actually my best friend. Note: I don't really have any other friends, only acquaintances. Anyways he's been my absolute rock throughout some really hard times with mostly my mental health problems. Honestly, bless him for putting up with my daily bullshit.\nI got married 3 years ago and my husband doesn't feel comfortable with me seeing Ben since he is my ex. I completely respect that and don't see him. But we always keep in touch. Anyways, he ended up moving to another state, so it's not like we could really see each other. It's not a plane trip far, but far enough that it's not feasible. Only when he visits his parents here would it even be remotely possible. \nI like to talk to him about fun stuff I could imagine us doing. Dumb stuff like recently I saw a YouTube video that's was truth or drink. Or going to see a movie we would both like. etc.\nBut yesterday after I shared something else I thought would be fun and he kinda snapped.

I think it's nice to imagine what we could do together, but he feels it's just disappointing and would rather not. Sometimes I feel like we should just break off the friendship if this separation is really such a big deal to him. He would be better off just cutting me out since it just pains him not to be able to see me. I need advice!\n\nBackstory: Ok so I am a young woman, age 23. I have a friend, a guy, also 23. Let's call him Ben. Ben and I dated shortly when we were in high school, but eventually broke up and stayed friends. He's actually my best friend. Note: I don't really have any other friends, only acquaintances. Anyways he's been my absolute rock throughout some really hard times with mostly my mental health problems. Honestly, bless him for putting up with my daily bullshit.\nI got married 3 years ago and my husband doesn't feel comfortable with me seeing Ben since he is my ex. I completely respect that and don't see him. But we always keep in touch. Anyways, he ended up moving to another state, so it's not like we could really see each other. It's not a plane trip far, but far enough that it's not feasible. Only when he visits his parents here would it even be remotely possible. \nI like to talk to him about fun stuff I could imagine us doing. Dumb stuff like recently I saw a YouTube video that's was truth or drink. Or going to see a movie we would both like. etc.\nBut yesterday after I shared something else I thought would be fun and he kinda snapped. He told me that it's annoying that I keep coming up with stuff we could do when, realistically, we'll probably never be able to do anything.\n\nUltimately, my thought is that you should be able to maintain a fun friendship even if it's long distance or separated.

My 19th birthday is coming up next month, and I've been planning on what to do. Almost every birthday has always been just my family and me, going out for dinner or something like that. This time I wanted to celebrate with friends for the first time because I entered university last year and I have a group of friends I'm very comfortable with and I wanted them to come over. My parents are kind of strict so there will be no alcohol and it's only going to be during the afternoon, not very late. That's why it's not really a \"party\" anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything seems kind of fine, however I'm just really scared that things won't work out well. Most of the people I invited come from different places (university, high school, middle school, etc.) and don't know each other. I feel like it could go either just well or it could just be that nobody will talk to each other and that it will get very uncomfortable. That's why I don't really know if I should do this or not. So I'd like to know if there's anybody here in this subreddit that might have been in a similar situation? And how did it go?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm just really insecure because, for example, if there was alcohol I know people might just be more open to conversation and having fun, but maybe that won't happen in this case. I don't even know what we might do, maybe they'll find board games too boring, or they won't want to get in the pool. I really don't want to blow it. If any of you have any ideas of what we could do/play it would be awesome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(I know this might come off as childish or cringy or whatever, I just really appreciate my friends, I don't want them to have a bad time or feel uncomfortable, but I just don't know how to do this.)  \n\n\n(Sorry if I don't write very well.

One was my best friend since like, we were about 9 or so (We'll call her M) and another was a dude I met that year (we'll call him P). We were all really close to each other, but something happened between M and P. Basically, M is really petty, and gets upset easily. I've actually lost friends before by choosing her over them, per her request, and I hate that I allowed that to happen multiple times.\nAnyway, M constantly bad talked P after their \"breakup\" and I felt like I was caught in between the two of them.\n\nAround this time, I had a lot of health issues. I was in the hospital a lot, and was falling behind in my schoolwork. I was failing the majority of my classes, and I was just really stressed and constantly anxious. (Keep in mind I'm not justifying my actions whatsoever, I just feel like you should know why I did what I did)\n\nAnyways, I distanced myself from a lot of people. Being constantly stressed was taking it's toll, and I felt like a zombie 24/7. So I slipped away. Everyone noticed this, literally everyone. And M took it personally. She talked about me behind my back, claiming I was just acting like that to her. But she ignored me just as much as I ignored her. She eventually texted me and we talked (if you can call it that) about it, and decided we didn't work anymore. I'm glad I cut her off, because once I took a step back, I've realized how toxic she's been.\n\nI'm sorry, thats another story for another time. Anyway, I stepped away from P as well. He didn't really say much to me, just asked a couple of times what happened. I never gave him a real answer, and I see him at school all the time. I'll smile at him every now and then, but I just feel so guilty that I cut him off without reason.\nI think he's moved on now, but I feel like he deserves to know why I did what I did.\n\nAgain, I'm not justifying my actions, because what I did was wrong, and I know that. It wasn't right for me to just cut him off because he did nothing wrong.\n\nIts been almost half a year now since it happened, and now that I'm in a better place (medically and mostly emotionally), I feel like I should at least text him and see if he wants to talk about it.\nI've been thinking about texting him and saying my peace, and leaving him to it.\n\nI wouldn't mind starting something with him again, because he was a really good friend that didn't deserve me.\n\nI guess I'm just asking, should I text him? If this happened to you, would you want the other person to tell you their reasons? Even if it's 4 months later? Or should I just let it be, and not bring up the past?\n\n\nTLDR: I cut off a friend unnecessarily, -due to personal issues-, should I apologize 4 months later or let it be?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She'll answer any other question except for \"If we were still hanging out this weekend\".  Any thoughts anyone can share to help ease this weird nervousness I have?

Never tell your friends everything about your life; they will either use it against you, make themselves feel better about their lives, or tell others, or even try to take advantage of you. \n\n2.

Your truth is your truth, when challenged be open minded to understand other's perspective but that doesn't mean there is something wrong with your truth. \n\n7.

I have become partially nocturnal, have not studied in over a month and have not done anything productive in a long time.\n\nI was a very good student in school and college. I guess that was because I was staying with my parents who always motivated and pushed me towards performing better academically. During my undergrad, I did good grades wise but I didn't do anything productive (like working an interesting project or learning a new language). I have not felt extremely motivated to do something meaningful unless there was a deadline hanging over my head. Sadly, I never took any form of sport during school or college. I used to hit a gym during brief spells (actually did manage to lose weight and get in shape, multiple times) but then after a time just gave up and gained weight again. I worked for a couple of years and then decided to do post grad. Because of my steadily declining work ethic I was not satisfied with the work I did at my job. I worked at an extremely well known company but I slacked off since the second month I started working there. During my first semester (post grad) I failed a subject, (I have literally never not been in top ten in class). The reason I failed was extremely stupid as well. Even after several warnings from my friends, I chose to register for four extremely heavy courses during my first semester. I will not lie, I could have managed doing it all, but as I have mentioned before I have just not been my top self ever since I left home to study. I made very poor choices regarding my courses and have suffered because of that. 2018 has been extremely depressing because I could not intern because of my low GPA, disheartened by the fact I failed a course, I fucked scored a very low grade in a course during second semester. Finally after a gruesome and depressing year, I managed bring my GPA above the required threshold to maintain my visa and status as a student.\n\nSince school I've never had friends whom I could hang out with after school, sure I did have friends but never the ones that lived nearby by. I have been in one long term relationship but we both knew that it would end someday. Even though the breakup was mutual and cordial, since during the later half of our relationship I had started living in a different city for my job, she got to keep the friends we had made when we were together. During my undergrad, work and post grad so far, I have made 2 good friends and few close acquaintances and its not for the lack of trying. I tried to be part of several events that occurred on campus, I even started learning salsa and bachata, but somehow I never made friends. This just baffles me.\n\nI think I have been without friends for too long. I am looking for someone who is tired of being a lazy unproductive pig and wants someone to motivate them to do things while doing the same for the other person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. I do not know how many will read the entire thing, but if you do, thank you. I have not been able to tell anyone about this, not completely at least. Have a good day. :)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

For about two or three months she still hangs around me and our friends and we have such a small campus and such a large friend group than when she would disappear to FaceTime her boyfriend I barely noticed, until the end when they called all the time and she ended up resetting to Chicago\u2019s time and not Rome\u2019s time which is where we were. \nWe both moved back to Chicago at the same time spent winter break apart because we live in different states but kept up talking as much as we could. \nNow we are back in our apartment, and I know that I\u2019m more extraverted than her. So I like to talk and hang out all the time when we\u2019re outside of class, like we used to just two months ago. But now we\u2019ll be watching movies, tv shows together or having a conversation and he\u2019ll call and she\u2019ll just pick up the phone and leave. Tv shows and movies together have always been our bonding thing, we only really spend about an hour or two together every day so our time together means a lot to me. I guess I should mention now I\u2019m very single and ridiculously unsuccessful in dating. But my girls have always been so special to me. And now I feel like what little time I have with her is being invaded by him. They\u2019re doin long distance right now, and I know that\u2019s hard I did that before. But also she genuinely isn\u2019t talking to or hanging out with me since we\u2019ve moved in together.\nToday is galentines day, like spend the day with your best friends. And I asked her if she wanted to get our favorite food, drink a lot and watch action movies (our past time often before her bf), he calls once during the first movie and once during the second. She made it back after twenty minutes talking to him from the first movie. The second movie, she hasn\u2019t made it back. The movies over. I watched this movie, by myself that she wanted to watch with me. I feel like I\u2019m losing her. Am I being too needy? Or am I doomed for her to forget about me? Is she in the wrong or am I? I just need to know if I\u2019m being too needy or expecting too much I have trouble with telling that sometimes. ", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

When we became friends, I was at a really low point in my life, So I'm worried that shes only here because of that. Anyways, recently she's started talking to one of other friends. My best friend and I have been talking less and less, and I've noticed that when she says \"I'm going to sleep\" In reality she stays awake for like 2 more hours talking to him. And today, she just goes \"K, talk to you in a bit!\" right when we were in the middle of a conversation. I don't know what to do anymore.

I tried to approach and fix our friendship but they still treat me that way. I need advice to fix or at least ease my feelings about them before we graduate ang part ways.\n\nI have three close friends for the majority of time studying in college. These people were like my \"main\" if you must say. They were the people I share my secrets, problems, stories, basically everything with. We fully trust each other. I make it sure that I'm there for them as they are there for me. That's basically how our relationship as friends go. \n\nThings changed when we had an issue with one of our friends in the group. One of our friends got a little cocky where she likes to boast about everything, she doesn't like it when one of us gets above her like in test scores for example, she got really bossy, and the three of us practically started getting annoyed with her. We started treating her differently; We rarely reply to her messages and left it on delivered, we excluded her from the group implicitly, our group talked about her negatively behind her back. We didn't have the guts to tell her what's wrong until things escalated. We talked and promised to become honest with how we feel about eachother. I promised myself to be as genuine as I can be with other people after that. No more back-stabbing, just presenting myself at face value. Things were back to normal until..\n\n..my relationship with the three of them started to drift away for no definite reason. I started to realize it when I get excluded from conversations. They were not as willing to listen to me as they were before. There were times when they went out without letting me know and sometimes hide it from me even. I felt like they were slowly building this wall without me knowing. As someone with an anxiety disorder, I started to overthink that I was the one getting this shitty treatment this time and it has affected me in every way.\n\nI started to talk with the closest person I have in the group. I asked him if there's a problem with me, and  brought up about things changing between me and the three of them. He told me that it was about my contribution for our business plan (We are required to do this project thingy for us to graduate and the four of us are grouped together). He told me that I only focus on the part assigned to me and not care about the project as a whole. He told me that I am somehow holding the group back because I got a lot of stuff that I can contribute but I don't bring it to the table and they are getting annoyed with that. I accepted what he said and treated it as constructive criticism to improve myself and our project.\n\nThings went good. I started to become more involved with our project and I really see to it that I really changed and that I didn't disregard what they told me. However, things are still drifting apart. I still feel excluded from the group. None of them seem to care about me the way they cared before. I felt like I was only there just to sit with them.. not to become friends with them like the way we used to be before. Even my closest friend in the group rarely talks to me and we have like these awkward silence moments whenever we're together. Basically, nothing changed except the annoyance is gone. This had worsen my anxiety disorder from thinking and thinking what am I still doing wrong. I was also diagnosed with mild depression by my psych because my anxiety has worsen. I started to distance myself a little because of this to prioritize my mental health and just started to accept the fact that maybe they don't like me anymore.\n\n It's our last semester in uni and I am still with them. Sure we still have laughs and small talks but the friendship's slowly fading. I just like to get some advice on how to like tell them about everything I feel about our friendship before we all part ways because I've been bottling this up, and maybe if I were to become honest with my feelings with them it would make our relationship better and we'll have great last memories before our graduation.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

His work phone had rang with such frequency that Thomas had to shut it  \noff completely and have his secretary Amanda Miller cancel any scheduled  \nmeetings for the day and if they were unavoidable to send Madeleine to them  \ninstead. Instinctively, Thomas took two valium and leaned back in his chair as  \nhe watched the news report on his computer. He was being considered a primary  \nsuspect in the death of Joanna Meyers, one of his top scientists in R&amp;D.  \nShe had been employed with his company for five years and had quickly become  \none of his most valuable employees. Joanna fit the bill of exactly how Thomas  \nliked his personal staff to be: tall, curvaceous and quick to follow commands.   \n\nWhile Thomas had his fair share of male employees, he made a point to place women in  \nhigher level positions or ones where he would have frequent contact. From a  \npublic relations perspective, Nebula One Corporation was championed as a  \nprogressive company which hired and promoted employees based on merit and not  \non their gender or through nepotism. Privately, Thomas enjoyed having faithful  \nand trustworthy women surrounding him who wore outfits that pleased him and  \nnever hesitated to fulfill whatever he needed done. Joanna, however, had  \nrecently overstepped her boundaries and was going beyond her purview as an  \nattractive stewardess for a strong and virile billionaire. The incident in the  \nstairwell had come unexpectedly, thanks to a tip provided by his security team.  \n\u00a0  \nHis thoughts were broken up by the entrance of Madeleine Olivier stepping into his  \noffice and closing the door behind her. There was a limited number of people  \nwho could enter into his office without being escorted by his secretary and  \nMadeleine was one of them. Madeleine\u2019s question about Joanna struck Thomas as  \ncoming from a place of confusion, rather than being presented with an  \naccusatory tone. Thomas stood up from the desk and buttoned his three-piece  \nsuit before going over and locking the office door behind her. He then walked  \nto his office phone and instructed Amanda that he would not be receiving anyone  \nunless they were law enforcement or his attorney.   \n\nOnce the order was given, Thomas gestured for Madeleine to join him by two leather  \ncouches which sat next to an enormous picture window which looked out over Los  \nAngeles County. Between the couches was a glass table which had a Ferrari V12  \nEngine as its base. The table held various reading materials, ranging from the  \n\\*Wall Street Journal\\* to \\*The Economist.\\* He sat down on the couch to the right  \nof the door and Madeleine sat down opposite him. Unbuttoning his suit, Thomas  \nleaned back and crossed one leg over the other to reveal purple and white socks  \nwhich matched his grey suit with purple accents.  \n\u00a0  \n\u201cUnfortunately,what you have heard is true. Joanna has indeed died. Quite a terrible thing  \nthat happened to her. I decided to take the stairs to the lower level to check  \non research with the Mark IV synthetic weave and found Joanna at the bottom of  \nthe stairwell with blood pooled around her head. It was a gruesome sight.  \nGhastly, really.\u201d  \n\u00a0  \nThomas shook his head as he folded his hands together over his knee and stared  \nabsentmindedly at the glass table for several moments. Keeping his composure  \nwas paramount, for Thomas had no intention of stepping into dramatics so  \nrecently after the event. He had already worked through being offended by the  \n$1 million bail set by Judge Kennedy, arguing that such a high price presumed  \nhis guilt, even though $1 million was pocket change for Thomas.   \nIncessant newspapers and journalists had been aggravating Thomas and his HR department  \nnonstop which did nothing to help his mood. Sitting down with Madeleine,  \nhowever, brought a sense of calm that Thomas had not expected. Madeleine was a  \nloyal and hard-working assistant who had no equal at NOC. Without her, Thomas\u2019s  \ncorporation would run at a fifth of the efficiency that it did under her care.  \nNow, however, Madeleine was going to be challenged with her biggest task yet  \nand Thomas hoped she would be up to the task.  \n\u00a0  \n\u201cSo,  what are the other employees saying about me out there? That I am a murderer, a  \ncold-blooded killer who attacked a white woman or so the stereotype goes for  \nblack men, am I right? Even though my mother is as white as they come and my  \ndad is mixed himself.\u201d   \n\u00a0  \n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I just know I need to get some things out. I\u2019ve been through some very heavy trauma in my life, (won\u2019t get into it here, previous posts) which I managed to escape thankfully. After being free I literally sunk into a deep depression, struggled with some serious mental issues and anxiety. I thought I\u2019d be happy once I was free, but that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nAnyways, in spite of everything I managed to finish my high school diploma and go to university. I wanted architecture, but I had missed the deadline and was given a scholarship for psychology and English, and so I went with that, I\u2019m currently nearing the start of my second semester with a 87 average. The plan was for me to do this and then switch to architecture in the same university once the registration opens, which was two weeks ago. I applied, and got rejected. Which messed everything up for me and got me feeling super anxious. I\u2019m at a point where I now need to drop out of university, work, and figure out where I wanna study architecture, and none of the options are ideal.\n\nThe concept of me dropping out, and not having university to fill my time freaks me out. I hate having free time because I feel like I\u2019m stuck and missing out more than I already have. I lost years of my life being kidnapped into sex trafficking. I don\u2019t wanna lose any more. My options are either waiting until October and studying in another country, studying in a university I dislike, or waiting until 2020 to reapply to the one I\u2019m currently in. And I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so afraid of waiting. I just really do not want to miss out and feel behind more than I already do. I was really into the idea of studying abroad, but the issue is my family. They have expressed the fact that they need me nearby or else they\u2019ll struggle. And for me I put my family first, always.\n\nIn addition to all of this, I\u2019m in a function relationship for the first time. But I\u2019ve been withholding a lot about my past, and I\u2019m realizing that all the issues that keep resurfacing, the body issues, the nightmares, panic attacks and other shit are all things I try to hide but keep showing, and I\u2019m worried that if I share I\u2019ll be judged, and I hate being vulnerable.\n\nSo yeah, all in all I could really use advice, or an online friend. I just feel alone, I never open up and never have. The only people I talked to about my past were the cops and a post on here. Currently feel really defeated and unsure of what to do next with my life. I just wish I didn\u2019t feel like such a failure", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We even hung out last night for Valentine\u2019s Day &amp; saw a movie the day before that, so it\u2019s very clear we both like each other.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, he\u2019s pretty awkward and I don\u2019t mind it at all but it does make it kind of difficult for me to know how to go about the relationship. He just kissed me for the first time on the movie date last night after talking for about 2 1/2 months and then hanging out for Valentine\u2019s Day last night, we cuddled but he didn\u2019t kiss me. I know he likes me but it\u2019s kind of hard for me because I really do want more of a physical connection with him, but I\u2019m also not the best at initiating it just because I\u2019m used to guys doing it &amp; I don\u2019t want him to feel like I\u2019m being pushy. I know that he\u2019s probably just nervous because whenever I lay on him or anything his breathing gets pretty noticeable, but I just don\u2019t really know how to get over that. By now honestly I would have probably slept with most people but I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m ever going to get there with him.\n\nAlso, we both know that we like each other and I really want to stop having to say I\u2019m \u201ctalking\u201d to him.

There's one person that's the worst then acts like nothing happened.\n\nWe recently got a new principle and admins that changed about everything with the school (Dresscode, policies, ect.) But in making most things worse, she made it kind of better for kids that a good. Me being one of them. One of the many privelages we get (others me not caring about at all) is being able to sit anywhere you want on certain days. So one day I decide 'hey, why not sit with a good friend of mine at lunch, what could go wrong?' \n\nMany people at my school know I'm a Athiest raised by a Christian family, we weren't very religious but out grandparents will always be. Most of my family doesn't even know other than one of my brothers and my mom and maybe a sister. It gets hard to hold this in, but harder to tell them and to think about rejection. So my biggest pet peeve is having people believe they are right about my religion, something they know almost nothing about because I knew for a fact they weren't athiest.\n\nSo, sitting with my really good friend (let's call her Jasmine (not her real name)) and the friends sitting around her, only 3 other people at the time because the others were sitting somewhere else, I tagged in on some conversations while eating.\n\nSomehow, me being an athiest got brought up. One of them asked what exactly that was, and I told them the basis of me not believing in god, or heaven, or hell, ect. One of the girls we sat with (let's call her Elizabeth) starting talking about how I was wrong, I forgot what exactly she said but here's the basis of it:\n\nMe: well, basically I don't belive in god or heaven or hell, I could go deeper into it but that's the basis of it all\n\nElizabeth: actually, atheists (some shit that isn't true)\n\nMe: Actually, none of that is true. Who even told you that?\n\nElizabeth: my sisters an atheist\n\nOf course, that's a huge pet peeve of mine. People questioning me about my religion that already took me a while to figure out on my own, but telling me I'm completely wrong about it not because they know but because they've been told by an outside source.\n\nMe: well, you must have heard your sister wrong because that's literal bullshit \n\nElizabeth: Well, I know I'm right and your not because my sister is an athiest and (blah blah blah)\n\nThe girl sitting next the her: dude, just stop. Your not right, and you know it\n\nShe got kind of annoyed but kept talking. Like I said the while conversation is a little vivid now but still. Either way after lunch I had chorus with Elizabeth and Jasmine. Luckly, Elizabeth was in ISS. \n\nLater Jasmine told me that Elizabeth said that if I sat with them the next day, she would literally get and and sit somewhere else. That part I remember entirely. Now, my grandma's very opinionated so it's hard to take that from one end but now I have another person telling me I'm wrong while I have the facts to prove I'm not.\n\nA few days later Elizabeth got out of ISS and was back in chorus with me. That day she acted like nothing happened. When I first spoke she turned around and was like \"oh, Tiffanys (not my real name lol)  here, I didn't even see you\" in a friendly, not seemingly malicious way. She didn't give me glares, or snappy comebacks or anything. So now I'm just super fucking confused. I know I hate her, because I hold a grudge and whenever your not a really good friends and break a really big pet peeve of mine, your in for it. But usually people don't act like nothing happened. Now I know we're al, teens and have mood swings but this was completely out of the blue. Idk if I should just reluctantly forgive her but stay away from her, or not forgive her and still stay away from her or just not stay away from her. Despite what I think I should do, I need advice. So, you guys got some?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

In? Idk.) the East Coast USA. My younger self would hate the idea of me having a 50hr a week desk job instead of becoming a comedian to pay the bills. But thats show biz. This generally means that in my free time I'm putting myself into some funky situations for a laugh just so I can hold these memories and do some stand up comedy as a senior citizen.\n\nAside from always wanting to laugh my butt off; I have an insane amount of energy which I can only comfortably release at concerts. Crowd surfing, \"mosh\" pits (more like bumper car pits), and running around like a maniac at punk rock / post hardcore shows will never fail to make me happy! I love music and believe there are gems in each genre. For the past year I've been more drawn towards Hail The Sun, Dance Gavin Dance, Night Verses, Polyphia, Beartooth, Ice Nine Kills, Circa Survive and others along that line. But that doesn't mean I can't get down to some Drake, JID, Gorillaz, Cage the Elephant, Frank Zappa, Eminem, folk, indie, kpop, jrock, yadda yadda you get the picture. When a concert isn't in town, you could probably find me watching repeats of Tom Segura specials, suffering at crossfit, taking classes, or driving around aimlessly; getting lost for fun.\n\nMy life isn't perfect, it never has been, never will be. But I continuously work towards bettering myself and helping my friends and family where need be. The people in my life are important to me so holding online friendships can sometimes be a challenge to balance.

I\u2019ve been trying to look for some friends for a while now, irl and online. I\u2019ve met a few cool people but since our interests/timezones are different, we don\u2019t get that special connection I guess. These past few days, i have been feeling lonely and empty and I\u2019m not depressed or anything, at least I think. I just feel like I\u2019m missing a special part of my life, and I don\u2019t know what that is. Can anyone relate?\n\nA bit about me:\n\nI love listening to music A LOT. Music is my inspiration source and I feel like I can do anything in the world when I\u2019m listening to it. Has anyone seen the new frozen trailer? The Revised version of \u201cVuelie\u201d in the trailer is simply amazing. I listen to pretty much any genre: pop, some rap, instrumental, edm, hip hop, rock, slow music, Kpop, space/relaxing music since it\u2019s so calming xD\n\nI love Dancing \ud83d\udd7a\ud83d\udc83. It\u2019s another inspiration source of mine and I do it as exercise and when I feel like I need to do something. As with music, I dance to pretty much any genre of music but I love dancing to inspirational music/dance such as the beginning part of\u201c190105\u201d stage performance of Jennie\u2019s solo, and also many others. I love watching world of dance, the tv show, which inspires me to create some of my own moves. I also like to exercise and run too haha. I\u2019m a very active person, and I love being that way. \n\nI love reading and writing \u270d\ufe0f. I\u2019m currently reading this book called \u201cOf mice and men\u201d, which many of you have probably heard of. Its actually a required reading for school, but I\u2019m enjoying it a lot. It\u2019s great and I can relate to the characters pretty well. It\u2019s amazing to read about people\u2019s imaginative worlds and creations. I sort of implement them into my own mind. Writing is something that I do for fun. I just write about how my day was and also if im feeling bad or had a rough day, writing is always there for me.\n\nThis is getting long so I\u2019ll just be brief here: I also like playing some video games, learning other languages, and analyzing how people respond to certain things which may sound weird haha.

To whomever is reading this, I hope your day is going well. I\u2019m not sure where to start, but I\u2019ll take a shot anyway.\n\nI suppose I can begin by saying why I\u2019m here\u2014 that reason being that I\u2019m chronically ill with a cocktail of autoimmune issues (and some anxiety), meaning I\u2019m not able to leave my house often as a result. This makes it pretty difficult for me to go out and meet folks in the traditional way, so I\u2019ve often relied on social media platforms in order to make friends. In fact, I have used this subreddit before to meet people and it worked pretty well, so I\u2019m honestly excited to try it once more. \n\nWhile I currently have some friends I\u2019ve met on other sites who I totally love, I feel like I could stand to expand my social circle and meet some new kinds of people in addition to \u2018em. The more the merrier, yeah?\n\nRegarding myself and my life, I\u2019m currently not working or in any college/secondary education. I stay at home right now due to my health, but I am an artist as a hobby and make a bit of income doing paid illustrations for others.\n\nI\u2019m not into any major fandoms or any huge passions, but I do have casual interest in my art (I\u2019m a fan of worldbuilding and making characters), cartoons + animation, animals, music (mainly pop, rock and indie), philosophy and psychology, photography, and paranormal stuff.\n\nAlso, It\u2019s okay if we don\u2019t really hit it off or things don\u2019t work out. There\u2019s no pressure, I just like giving people a chance. I\u2019m down to talk about anything, whether it\u2019s small talk or deep conversation.\n\nThere\u2019s only a few things I\u2019m lookin\u2019 for in a conversation partner:\n\n- Ideally I want to restrict the age range of who I talk to to about 18-23, for a variety of reasons, but I\u2019m willing to consider people a couple years older.\n- I can talk through reddit PM at first, but I prefer talking over discord or twitter.\n- I prefer talking to tolerant and open-minded individuals, as I\u2019ve had bad experiences with folks on here that ended up being 4chan bigots. I\u2019m LGBT (bi and gender nonconforming) and it\u2019s pretty important to me that my friends are cool with it.\n- Due to my medical issues, I may take a long time to respond to things if I\u2019m not feeling well enough to talk. This isn\u2019t anything personal, please don\u2019t think I\u2019m ignoring you!\n- I\u2019m patient with other people and their response times, I don\u2019t mind a slow pace. I don\u2019t expect the other person to talk daily or anything if they don\u2019t wanna.\n\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to any responses I get!

Sorry for the length of this post.\n\nI live with my very close friend A. He moved in with me about two years ago and I introduced him to most of my friends here in town. We share a very close friend D, who used to be sorta my best friend, but ever since she had to move to another city for work our friendship has reverted back to being \"just\" quite close. A and D are rather close as well. Then there's L, another good friend of mine here in town. When I introduced A to my local friends, L was among them. I regard all three, A, D, and L, very highly and shared some of my family problems with them and even taking them, individually, as back-up to see my family in the past (which is a high sign of trust for me personally).\n\nA told me a couple of weeks ago that he and L have been secretly dating for about two months now. I was pretty shocked as I thought I had special bonds with either of them, and to hear they had been dating behind my back without ever letting me know... took a while to get used to. We briefly talked about the fact that I was hurt I got to know about it so late, and I asked for some time to get used to the changed situation since I'm not good with change. I want to reach the point of being happy for them, but I'm not there yet.\n\nI've shared part of my hurt with D since I (used to) share just about everything with her. She said she'd only known for a short time as well. I admit my hurt is mostly due to a selfish idea of being the special one, of wanting to be the most important person in my friends' lives, and she (rightfully) called me out on that. I still don't quite understand why I'm hurt so bad by A and L dating to be honest. Accepting has been a slow process.\n\nA tried to talk to me about my feelings on the subject again, but I mostly blocked it off since I don't know my own feelings. It so happened that I figured out his phone password a few days ago, and curiosity got the better of me. While A was at work, I unlocked his phone and read his messages with D, searching exclusively for L and my names to see how they really felt. I know this is a breach of trust. I couldn't help myself.\n\nAs it turns out, D knew about A having a crush on L ever since he started having feelings for L. A told her when he and L officially started dating, all of it. A and D constantly tell each other \"you're my favorite\" and share much more with each other than with me. They talk about how much of an ass I can be, how they feel they can't tell me certain things because I might react in a mean way, how I irritate people, how I'm hard to read and understand, how I demand much more from them than I am willing to offer myself in a friendship. D even shared confidential messages I sent her with A, and A shared with her how he worried I might have a thing for L and that's why I'm so upset about A and L dating.\n\nThey wouldn't say half these things to my face (probably because they're afraid of how I'd react). They only randomly tell me when I'm being an asshole. And whenever I feel down and voice my anxiety that I'm just an asshole, that all my friends eventually realize they're better off without me, they deny that even though it is LITERALLY happening right now, again. I'm the asshole who can't just be happy two of my best friends found love with another, I'm the asshole who can't voice their feelings about it, I'm the asshole who breaches everyone's trust by reading private messages about it.\n\nWhile I feel very hurt about how things are going right now and kind of betrayed, I have to admit that most of the things they said about me are right. It's my nature to be stand-off-ish and I know I come off as mean even when I don't mean to. How do I become a person people trust? How do I trust my friends when they talk like this behind my back and lie to my face?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I like all the usual things, music, movies, reading, attempting to learn to draw, I'm a big comedy fan. I have a terrible sense of humour, you've been warned! I enjoy cooking and keeping fit. Going to try growing some stuff to cook with this year. I'm also attempting to learn to draw. I'm not really a gamer so might want to skip me if you're looking for a gaming buddy. No sure what else to put.\n\nOnly thing I ask is you say more than just how r u? Tell me something about you, tell me a joke or have a rant, anything really. I know some people find it awkward knowing what to say but there's no pressure, I'm just some random person on the internet and you never know, we might click :)\n\nSo if you want to voice chat, watch a film, have a rant, chat or just swap some terrible jokes then [send me a PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=-walnut-), I don't bite!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Sometimes I cannot tolerate their greedy, and obviously specially when this shit is linked with me in any way.\n\nHe is cappable of stay more than 2 weeks in a rough flu, and just for not spend 5\u20ac more or less in medicines he rather that \"the flu past for their own\", and this isn't linked to that he is reluctant to take meds or something like that, is just for not spend money. He is continuously complaining about their mother ask for 50\u20ac every month and sometimes a little more throughout the month, because the situation of their family economically is hard. He even arrived A LOT of time to my home and said \"shit man, I forgot buy cigarettes or I forgot them in the car or in my house\", and of that way so much times he smoke cigars of my box, until one day he came with the same history that he forgot buy them, and I said \"ok smoke, but later we go to buy a box and you give me some proportional cigs, because almost always happens the same\", and since that day never forgot their box again.\n\nIn another situation I could watch him without he be conscious of it, and he was a long time with a lighter in a house of some friends, on 24th December of after, and he was thinking about stealing the lighter that took from the table HOURS before, later he put it in their pocket. This was so disgusting, and since this moment I started to realize his stingy nature.\n\nDo you have a friends of so many years that behaves like this? What do you do with it, and how you can bear it? I don't see him like a time ago with the pass of time and seeing more facts like these. I don't interested in cut the  friendship with him because I know him since a long of years and we have a lot of experiences and great memories togheter. And we have a lot of friends in common, and I comprobated in the past in times when I had problems with him and we don't speak anything each other for months, that was very problematic to make plans with common friends, specially on weekends. We live in a small city, and you know what I mean. So simply I avoid him, I only talk with him when he talk me esporadically for whatsapp, and I don't put enough effort in the conversation, surely he feel it. \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to vent and know about another possible people that could be in the same boat like me, and how they handle and how it is their situation.\n\nThanks for your time in read me and thanks in advance for your possible answers.

Weird, but good?\n\nEver since my tragic falling out with my old best friend, Ryan last year, I've been very depressed and quite guarded about making friends and getting close to anyone new. Especially with anyone of the same sex, because I just cannot fuck with any guys that has any amount of toxic masculinity running through them any more.\n\nHowever, I am trying to have the mindset that he left, but that means the opportunity for someone even better will come along.\n\nOddly enough, I feel like that might be happening? I have been chatting with a guy from Instagram and we've been talking quite a decent amount ... We talk about life, he supports me and my love for theatre, he says he loves my energy, that I'm a real and amazing  person and that he wants to be friends with me for real. He's literally said, \"I wanna be best friends and make art with you.\"\n\nI mean, shit ... he even gave me his phone number number so we can text each other. You don't give your number to just anyone, ya know?\n\nEven offered to send me some money because I'm going through a tough time right now.\n\nLike, he's genuinely a good fucking soul.\n\nThe hang up (I guess?) is that he's a YouTuber/Content Creator that I was a follower of (I'm going to keep his identity anonymous, just for respect sake). He's not super fucking major huge and famous or anything, but he's still fairly well known. Idk, like ... 55K or so subscribers? And that's not an issue for me, because I don't care about a person's follower count or anything like that ... If you got a good vibe and a good heart, I like you. And I really like him and enjoy his friendship a lot.\n\nIt's just kinda come out of nowhere? It feels really sincere, though. He doesn't gain anything monetary from me, he's in an adorable, committed relationship with his boyfriend, so he doesn't wanna be with me, he doesn't want an excuse to come to LA and stay with me for free ... He just wants to know me for me and I really enjoy that closeness. And somehow, I feel more appreciated than I ever had with Ryan.\n\nI guess I just don't know how to feel? It seems so quick, and I don't want to get any of my hopes up for anything. Friendship, especially a close friendship, means a lot to me, because I take it seriously. It's not a game to me. When I love/care about someone, I love/care hard.\n\nSo, I think for now, I'm going to enjoy what we have so far, stay on guard, but don't hold anything back. My past is my past, and my current life is up to me.\n\nThat sounds like a good idea, right?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I would prefer to make some long term friends. I like to have in depth long ranging conversations. Lets see how this goes. I guess I should say a bit about myself.\n\nThe basics: INFJ-T personality type, went to school for history and political science, 27 years old, guy, I have a dog. I live in the eastern USA, Work in tech support\n\nInterests: There are a-lot. To keep it simple ill list the most prominent ones. \nHistory and Politics (obviously). I like reading about all history essentially and I discussing/debating various political topics and positions. That being said I'm not volatile or combative about it. Im not looking to assert that my opinion is correct, I like an intellectual exchange. \nAnime/Manga. Been watching anime since I was 7 or 8 so Ive seen a-lot and I'm familiar with most titles. Same thing for manga. If you want to discuss something feel free to bring it up. Likely ill know at least a little about it.\nFilms. I generally enjoy watching movies of any type. I tend to lean toward sci fi, historical and mystery. A few favorites: Blade Runners, Alien films, 10 cloverfield lane, V for Vendetta, The Pianist, The Downfall, Atomic Blonde, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Interstellar. Just to name a few.\nTV. not a huge TV watcher but I do catch some shows. Favorites off the top of my head are 1983, Altered Carbon, Man in The High Castle, The Grand Tour, Disenchantment, Futurama, Rick and Morty, Bravest Warriors. \nScience. I generally like all science. I prefer to discuss physics, astrophysics, astronomy, or engineering. Ive been a science nerd most of my life. Anything related to the topic interests me\nRacing. I love motorsport of all types. I love cars in general but I tend to lean toward liking racing applications. Favorite types of racing are GT Endurance, Rally, Touring Car Racing and Drifting\n\nExtra info: I read some books but not a ton. Favorite book is probably Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Phillip K. Dick. Im also rather fond of Harry Potter. Ive read all the novels. Music I listen to anything really but I prefer Indie and Rap. Off the top of my head favorite bands are The Arctic Monkeys, The Wombats, and Two Door Cinema Club. Hard to choose a favorite rapper. My dog is a border collie lol. His name is Oreo. I build models, gunpla. Ill show you if you like\n\nIf you aren't bored to death at this point send me a PM.

We only had two dates and it felt like the right thing to tell her how I feel about us. She appreciated my honesty and told me she really likes me as well, but she was uncertain because of the distance of our hometowns. I assured her, that the distance is no problem for me and that I visit her town just to get to know her better and like to spend time with her. However, she read the message, but didn't reply. She almost never initiated conversations and it overall felt like my feelings were not mutual. As I like her as person and we have rather unique interests in common, it was for obvious after our first date, that if this wouldn't work out in a romantic way, I would like to keep this as a friendship.\n\nOn our first date, I invited her to visit my hometown, which she agreed to in February as there is semester break. In the first week of February I texted her that I would like to talk to her personally about one thing or another as I value our friendship and she should let me know if she likes to visit my hometown. She replied, that she is sorry for not replying, but she had things to do and she is unsure when she can come to my town, but she let me know in any case if she finds a suitable date for the visit.\n\nMy feelings for her start fading and the more I think about it, I think a friendship is the best I can get out of this situation. However, actually I'm afraid she never messages me regarding the visit, which lead me to the thoughts that I might was mistaken about her and the things she told me (that she really likes me). I'm not going to broach the subject again and would like to let her approach me and see if she really comes to visit me. But I'm in conflict: Somehow I feel like this is the final mark as if she reaches out to me she likes to have a friendship with me and if she don't, she doesn't want a friendship. Any advice on how to handle the situation or if I might be mistaken to condition a friendship if she doesn't get in touch with me in February?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I've never watched it myself but in it this girl apparently writes a fake suicide letter to the people who were horrible to her. She then said if she was to write a fake suicide letter she'd sent it to two of the other friends in our group who we'll call Izzy and Gemma, as they pissed her off earlier in the day. After she said this they came up to us and asked what we were stalking about. Maria quickly butted in before I could say anything and told them TV. They kept questioning us but I kept my mouth shut. During English Gemma asked my what I was talking about so I didn't bother lying so I told her the truth. I'm think she then got the wrong idea and confronted Maria who denied and texted me saying how I'd lied telling \"everyone\" she wanted to kill herself. I corrected her but she kept to her story. When I got home my mom said she'd had a missed call off Maria's mom and a text saying what I'd apparently done. I told my mom my side and she believed me and phone Maria's mom back. The next day I thought everything would go down and in the end everyone would believe me. I was so wrong. Everyone had heard Maria's story and believed her without hearing what I had to say. I stopped hanging out with them but we are friends again now but I feel like I don't want to be for multiple reasons...\nSorry for any error I'm using my phone. ", "subreddit": "friendship"}

This all started in July when I was hanging out with two of my friends. One (friend A) said that he was going home to take a shower and that he\u2019d be back in an hour or so. Three hours past and he didn\u2019t answer any of our texts or calls. The friend that was still with me (friend B) is never home because he lives three hours away with his dad, so this hurt him a lot. He is always afraid of speaking his mind and confronting someone. So I told him to text our \u201cmissing\u201d friend that I was angry at him when in reality, I was just disappointed. Friend A replied to friend B by saying tell (me) that I am not his fucking dog. This angered me because he lied to our faces then  got angry at me for being upset. So after all this I messaged him explain how I felt and he responded with \u201c I already made plans with someone else\u201d which is weird because if this was true then maybe he shouldn\u2019t have hung out with us in the first place. Months went be and we fought every now and then up until three days ago. In a group chat we had he started making fun of me and everyone else in it. None of us did anything and he kept spamming me. This affected me because my mom had some health issues and I needed to hear what was happening without my phone constantly going off. So I blocked him on Snapchat and Instagram. Not three hours later friend B sent me a pic of his (friend A) Snapchat story, saying that I\u2019m a fake friend and I\u2019m a pussy, he said he wanted to fight me because all I did was remove him for more important things.

I have a gym membership and I have gone a few times, but I really should go more, so I need someone to help make me go to the gym. I need to lose some weight and get fit :)\n\nI want to stay positive and continue to hunt for new people to talk to, ideally I\u2019d like a friend that lasts and we talk daily, then maybe it turns into something more?  I have been trapped in my own head and depression for too long, it is time to change that. Another thing I want to do is get started with some photography, I know everyone is doing it now, but Australia is such a beautiful place and I want to capture that. If you like photography and have any tips for a complete novice, I'd appreciate it :) \n\nBonus points if you live in Australia and/or Brisbane, as I would love to meet up and hang out for a bit, go see some films or stuff like that. Also, if you happen to live really close to me, maybe you\u2019d want to be my gym buddy, I would like someone that can force me to go out and come out of my shell more and experience life. If you know of any good groups that we can go to, that would be great, but note I don't drive at the moment, so travelling may be tricky (I plan on getting my licence this year as well).\n\nSo, a little bit about myself; [my name is Elliot.](https://imgur.com/a/bWpXdm5), I am 24 years old, I was born in the UK and now live in Australia. I work in retail in a homewares store as a 3IC/Supervisor/Manager, it\u2019s a good job and helps me pay the bills. I have had a lifelong love of all things Sci-fi, my favourites are Star Trek, Star Wars, and Battlestar Galactica. Additionally, I love all things gaming related, I started off on PS1/2 then Xbox 360 and now I have a custom PC: lately I have been playing a fair bit of overwatch (I don't really have a \"Main\", I change pretty much each time I play haha). I did just start getting back into WoW again, a group of friends play so I joined in, I am currently playing a Human Retribution Paladin, bringing in that Holy punishments.  I have also been playing various other games mixed in between, feel free to ask me about them.\n\nI love to read, mainly I read Star Trek a lot, pretty much every day on the way to work, I have read probably hundreds of books so far haha I love the variety of the stories and complexity that they can provide at times. They provide me with a nice little place to escape to and a good distraction while I am on the way to work. If anyone is interested, I am currently reading the I.K.S Gorkon series of books, my favourite series has to be the Destiny trilogy though. \n\nI am a big music kinda guy, I listen to a very wide range of music, everything from Elton John and George Michael to Paramore and Placebo, I even listen to a number of movie/tv soundtracks.  I am not sure how much people want to know about me straight up, but feel free to ask me anything you like at any time :). I am pretty cool and interesting, I have lived quite a varied life and travelled a lot when I was younger, I am pretty intelligent (though my grammar and spelling suck shit), so I can hold a decent conversation.\n\nLike I said before, I don\u2019t get out much or socialise, mostly due to working a fair bit but also I am anti-social haha I work in retail so I don\u2019t like spending my time off in shops etc, though I still like going out and seeing the odd movie from time to time. So basically, I am looking for some more friends to talk to and get to know.  I am after something kinda long term so let's be friends first and if other things happen then we shall see where it goes :) I don't care about your age, race or religion, just be nice and non-judging with me and I will do the same for you. I will treat everyone the same and go into each discussion with an open mind. I am quite flexible. I consider myself pretty interesting\n\nIf you like bad jokes and random trivia then I am the guy for you (Puns are the best jokes). Here are some quality examples:\n\n&gt;What did the grape say when it got stepped on? Nothing, it just let out a little wine\n\n&gt;Did you hear about the murder in the greenhouse? The police say most of the evidence was planted.\n\n&gt;How do you make Holy water? You boil the Hell out of it\n\nIf you like cute puppies, I have one of those, [her name is Mia, and she is almost 2 now.](https://imgur.com/a/VrmTQ) She is a mad little ball of energy but is also super cute and awesome, I have grown up with dogs all my life and I couldn\u2019t imagine life without one. \n\nI could probably spend ages adding more detail to this, but I don't want everyone to be totally overwhelmed with a wall of text (sorry if you already are), I just feel like it's important for everyone to get a good idea of who I am and what I am like straight up. Anyways, let's chat, have fun and be best buddies. If you want to chat, then send me a PM, tell me about yourself and we can share details :)   Thanks for reading my super long post, if you made it to this part of my post then you probably deserve a brownie or something haha\n\nAll the best, \nElliot \n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

If it weren\u2019t for eating and brushing my teeth, I wouldn\u2019t have opened my mouth at all today. Last night I went to Target just to browse the aisles. The soda cans were all half the size I remember, but looked to be about the same price. I think they had some cutesy name to compensate. Damn marketing. I wasn\u2019t surprised. I was surprised by the wall of seltzer. My experience is you might see some snooty European water in a green bottle tucked away on the bottom shelf of the snack aisle, by the import crackers. And, of course, some store-brand tonic water and club soda for your mixed drinks. Yesterday, I saw prime real estate riddled by carbonated, sans sugar water in nearly every fruit combination imaginable. All were \u201cnaturally flavored\u201d of course. If you looked closely at the packaging some of them had sugar in them. At that point, it\u2019s just a fruity soda. The labels said seltzer though.\n\nI stood staring at all the options in astonishment. Some lady with a shopping cart came and stood next to me also examining the many choices. We both stood there a long time, but we didn\u2019t speak to each other.\n\nI bought a half liter or so of something labeled ginger lime mule. It felt like it was missing sugar, also mule.

{"post_id": "asay9p", "created_utc": 1550586431, "title": "27/Male- \"You can always tell a real friend: when you've made a fool of yourself he doesn't feel you've done a permanent job.\" Laurence J. Peter", "author": "Maraging_steel", "self_text": "I'm very upfront and intense from the get go. I treat people I have just met as if they have been my friend for a lifetime. I'm sure a lot has to do with how people with my personality type approach the world (INFJ) but all the same it's hard to find people who don't want to just shoot the breeze or play video games together. Depression has taken a lot of joy in life from things I once took pleasure in and I have had many people walk out of my life. The good thing is now I am realizing what matters most when you are close to someone. Not shared hobbies or TV shows or movies but compassion, understanding, empathy, love, gentleness, availability, confidentiality, trustworthiness and patience. I don't need someone to entertain me. I need someone to be with me when I have days of great success in going out and interacting socially and days where I struggle to eat or take care of myself.\n\n\nI cannot change who I am. Perhaps for most it's not what they seek. But it is who I am and I won't change just to have a companion even though I desperately want one.\n\n\nHow to make a post stand out? Do I list games that interest me, foods I enjoy cooking, books I like to read? Or do I come full stop with the inner pains of my heart, desperate for hope and affirmation? Perhaps, I should do both, to give credence to both the temporal man with his likes and dislikes as well as to the inner man who constantly is observing a war between joyfulness and despair.\n\n\nFor the temporal man, I find great enjoyment in reading books of all kinds. Primarily non fiction but I do have some fiction as well. I also heartily engage in the preparing and crafting of sustenance that not only gives nutrients but also pleasure and good memories. Musically, I am inclined to the classics of all genres (rock, jazz, blues, instrumental) with a scattering of modern day mixed in. Regarding TV shows/movies/video games I unfortunately must disappoint in that I do not take much interest in these things as I once did. However, documentaries, historical dramas and select films are always available to be watched with good company.\n\n\nNow, the inner man. How to describe the conflagration raging within me? Burning through my limbs, scorching every fiber of my being. Depression roars, seeking to consume all life which remains. Oh depression! Bitter, biting, breaking. How long must you torment me? How long must I feel crushed by your weight? And you are not alone! Anxiety comes as a serpent, enticing me with false promises of security if I only continue to concern myself with the future. What if I never get better? What if I remain isolated from family and friends? How can I continue to remain in this state? How long will my agony be!\n\n\nAs I drink the deceiving cup of Anxiety, the snake slowly wraps its powerful body around my neck and chest, forming a noose of pain and misery. I struggle to breathe. I grip tightly around the beast, hoping to pull myself free from its embrace. But it is too powerful to do so alone. I need assistance, someone to help me restrain my every present foe.\n\n\nSo what am I looking for? \n\nLove. \n\nBut not love as two people who are to be wedded in blissful matrimony, romantically enthralled with the passions of desire and intimacy. Nor do I mean love that a parent radiates for their child, one of unconditional acceptance and nurturing. The love I speak of is that between two companions whose bond runs deep, joined together by chains of iron and steel. Someone who I can speak to about whatever pains my heart, regardless of how sensitive it may be. Someone of whom I can also rejoice in the good things in life, with joy and laughter and glee. Someone whom I can speak to from the moment I arise until the hour of the Sandman comes to take me away to the unconscious mind where things impossible in reality take place. Someone who knows when to laugh and when to cry. When to give advice and when to listen. When to be happy and when to mourn. Someone who wants to forge a companionship that is not bound by preferences of food and drink but is sewn together by mutual affection and concern for the other. \n\n\nDoes such a person exist? I hope beyond hope they do! \n\n\nhat I can tell you is that I am committed to showing you that someone can be compassionate and sensitive to your needs. If allowed I would like to be able to craft a deep and meaningful companionship that is long lasting and full of honesty and kindness. I know it's rare to have such relationships these days but it's what my goal is. I want you to feel that when we are communicating that this is a safe place where you can be vulnerable and free from concerns of abandonment or condemnation. I will strive to always be sensitive to your needs and craft my responses with sincerity and specificity to who you are, not giving you generic answers.\n\n\nWhatever you want to discuss and however long you want to talk I am here. I am fully committed once the friendship has begun. Sun up to sundown you can expect to hear from me, checking on you throughout you day, sifting through the generalities to see into the deeper things of your soul that really affect you good and bad. Not all conversation will be so heavy as I enjoy sarcastic and dark humor along with playful picture swapping and funny jokes.\n\nNeed help fighting the tension that comes with depression A short quote and anecdote that resonates with me. \u201cHaving anxiety and depression is like being scared and tired at the same time. It\u2019s the fear of failure but no urge to be productive. It\u2019s wanting friends but hate socializing. It\u2019s wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely. It\u2019s caring about everything then caring about nothing. It\u2019s feeling everything at once, then feeling paralyzingly numb.\u201d \u201cA man sought a physician to prescribe him medicine for his lowness of spirit and habitual despondency. The physician provided the medicine, but also suggested going to the theatre to hear Carlini - the renowned comedian, saying \u201cIf he can\u2019t help you, no one can!\u201d \u201cAlas! Sir,\u201d said the man, \u201cI am Carlini.\u201d I would say I am writing this seeing if anyone else feels the way I do? It has been hard to find friends whether in person or online because my interests often do not line up and people hesitate to want to have conversation with someone who doesn\u2019t share their interests. I always felt that you don\u2019t have to have the same hobbies to be friends. True friendships can form when people support and show interest in the other person\u2019s activities even if they themselves don\u2019t do them. I may not play video games anymore (sold systems for needed money, lost passion with depression) but I can do research and watch videos to keep up with your gaming. I don\u2019t currently watch much Netflix but if someone were to want to have a viewing partner for their favorite shows I would join them. If someone wanted to discuss their stuffed animal collection I\u2019ll be right there to help categorize and discuss what makes each one unique. Anyways, been dealing with chronic depression, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia and intermittent suicidal idealization (with previous attempt). If anyone wants to talk and try and sort out their lives with me, feel free to do so.\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

(Aliens welcome!)", "author": "susliklev", "self_text": "Because I've been feeling all sorts of blue recently, and would love some of those 'friend' things people are always talking about.\n\n\n\nAs for what I am up to right now? Pretty unexciting, to be honest -  stressing about the future and wondering on the wisdom of dumping close to a grand on a plate carrier, because reasons \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\n\n\nPlanning on trying to join reserves, so am about as excited as it gets (/s) about doing basic training this summer, provided that I can get in. Also, incredibly-detailed paperwork is super fun (also /s). \n\n\n\n*If you are someone who is not going to bother reading the following wall, I encourage you to click the lil' X on top of this tab now. Thank you!* :) \n\n\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info (AKA full autobiography) about me:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian fluently.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate.\n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned career, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, which I am dealing with as best as I can - although recently, things have been on the mend - enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n- Living with my parents for financial convenience - yay! :D\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am somewhat stigmatized against the latter by a some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not in fact a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandise and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed. \n\n- Gainfully *un*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work.\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Automata, WoW, DOOM, Bioshock, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. Honestly, for whatever reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nRight now, I am playing Battle Brothers, this roguelike tactical game about managing a mercennary outfit in a fantasy setting. Other than being infuriatingly-hard, it is good!\n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favorite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favorite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loath cheap jumpscares they are so enamored with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n\n- My sense of humor is possibly the worst, and I have dank memes ready for every possible situation and I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile humor. \n\n- My main hobby right now is Airsoft. I spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together, since I ordered most of my gear from companies in Russia. I guess I really prefer quality, which is why I was willing to fork over money for real military stuff instead of more affordable replicas.  But at least the gear is quite nice and looks good. \n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I think it is time to give up trying to categorize what I like by genre, and instead do it by what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord) I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n\nRight now, I am super into Ghost and Pain - if it is not obvious by this point, I am so edgy that I (used to) cut myself :D\n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%, due to a certain affinity for slithering neck-ties, ambitions and ruthlessness. \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. Stuf like lack o punctuatuion impropar gramar to short n generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit.\n\nI prefer using Discord over anything else, but I like to get to know people on here before jumping in there. Please no Reddit Chats, I hate the UI. \n\nFeel free to hit me with your favorite ice breaker / shower question! (As long as it is not a Trotsky ice pick). \n\n\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

{"post_id": "asfct9", "created_utc": 1550610086, "title": "My friends don't take me seriously and get mad when I can't take it anymore", "author": "abcbibi", "self_text": "It's a long story, so get ready.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met my bestfriend at age 8 , we liked the same boy in class, after the boy moved away and her old friends ditched her, she started to hang out with me and my other friends (who also were starting to ditch me at the account of my starting to like things they didn't). She (Let's call her Juliana, it's not her real name), and I liked the same things so we just had a grand old time talking about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe started to do everything toghether and our older friends drifted apart (perhaps it was my fault since I got obsessed with pokemon at the time... something my other friends didn't like), but we remained toghether. With her I soon started to become very shy, non-confrontational and barely talked to anyone besides Juliana anymore, I felt very anxious talking with anyone else, at my childhood I was very talkative, I did feel shy from time to time but still managed to speak my mind and even 'pick fights' if I tought someone was in the wrong. But now I had changed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe usually did school work toghether, I was obsessed at getting good grades and since I had noticed Juliana didn't give a shit about it I would usually do most of the work (she... wasn't the sharpest knife of the shed at the time, thinking 30cm was a meter, mispronouncing really common names and renegarally not knowing the basic of the basics. Not saying I'm extremely smart of anything... but she was a year older than me and I had to keep teaching her things). But soon I started to noticed that she just left me to do all the work and even worst: She didn't do her part right. She would draw in the front of our shared tests (something very common to do back in the day) despite me BEGGING her not do it. When she was to send me her part of the project trought e-mail she wOullldd snet thingsss like thisng and usually not very long wich left me to do even MORE work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the worst at the time... she bullied me. I had a crooked nosed at the time and because of that, she and some other girls called me a 'macaw' I didn't like it. She also called me a 'bulldog' because my cheeks were and still are very puffy and soft. I told her off in both instants after a while, she stopped calling me 'macaw' and 'bulldog' (she called me squirrel insted, but that one I liked because I really like squirrels). But also... she hit me, she would slap me and kick me, I told myself she was just playing, even when my legs would go black from all the kicks, I now notice that I tended to hide the bruises from my mother. Once we were playing videogames at my house, some Sonic game I don't remember the name of, I went to say something to her and she just said 'Shut up I'm playing the game!' and shoved her elbow in my face, causing my mouth to bleed since I used braces at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day another girl came along, let's call her Sam, at first I was squeptical of her but we soon became great friends. We all shared similar interests and had a lot of fun toghether. But Sam seemed to side more with Juliana, she too would hit me, mess about with school work and send me messed up parts of projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, I snapped. For contest, I have a medical issue in wich I had to go to the hospital a day each month to get an infusion, making me miss classes (I could usually get what I missed either from Sam or Juliana, or some other nice people in class), and this was such an ocassion, I asked a teacher if I could make our presentation a day earlier since I had to go to the hospital the day after. The teacher agreed, the project had been given about two months earlier and the girls still hadn't sent me their parts. I told them to do it ASAP and explained the situation, I could speak on my own in front of the class, I didn't care, I just wanted to get a good grade since my grades were falling. The girls said ok and sent me some things. I put it all toghether and into a pendrive and got read for the presentation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day as I am sitting in class next to the girls\n\nMe: Are you girls ready?\n\nJuliana: Oh we asked the teacher if we could do it tomorrow.\n\nMe:... what?\n\nSam: Yeah we weren't ready for it.\n\nMe: Dudes... I told ya I could speak up front you wouldn't need to do anything.\n\nJuliana: Ya but we tought it would be best that way.\n\nSam: That way we can do it toghether.\n\nMe:... I told you I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.\n\nSam: Oh... sorry we didn't know.\n\nMe, starting to let my anger out at this point: I FRICKING TOLD YOU STUPID FUCK!\n\nSam went silent that that point, and I almost felt like crying, I had been taking to much of this, they didn't do anything of importance and still messed me up everytime. I turned to look at the front of the class again, my hand on my forhead, trying to breath. Then I heard it from behing me.\n\nJuliana: That... that wasn't very nice of you OP.\n\nMe: WHAT WASN'T NICE IS YOU ALWAYS PLAYING WHEN I HAVE TO DO ALL THE WORK!\n\nI didn't talk to them for the rest of the class, still sat with them at lunch without looking or talking to them.\n\nJuliana: ... You should apoligize, that wasn't nice.\n\nMe: I don't have to apologize to anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe later made amends, I don't exactly remember how or why but we did, they didn't hit me after that and started to be a tiny little bit more helpful with school matters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSam left the school the next year. We all still kept contact with each other. But for some reason I didn't feel like talking to them, specially Juliana. I still managed to talk to Sam and even went to a comic convention and play video games with her. But I just couldn't brind myself to speak to Juliana unless it was necessary, like school projects... since I didn't really know anyone else, they either already had their groups or I was too anxious to talk to anyone. In one such ocasion Juliana, asked me, in a loud voice \"How is your gender identity going?', I felt myself go red, she knew I had been going trought some things regarding my gender and sexuality, but I never tought she would say it loud for the whole world to hear. I told her I discovered it was just a phase. It was a lie but I didn't want to talk to her about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the three of us graduated higschool and started college we went our separated ways but still comunicate.\n\nAt my first year of college I came out to my parents as a transman and gay. My parents didn't take this well. And the only other people I had to turn to, were Sam and Juliana. They accepted me for what I was, and sometimes they comfort me when I have my anxiety attacks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut there are still problems. Juliana sometimes still deadnames me and refers to me by 'she' and 'her'. At the end of last year we had a sleep over at my grandparent's house and once Sam was changing clothes she looked back at us, I wouldn't mind seeing her naked since I've already seen my own (very much disliked) body and I'm gay, but I would still turn around or leave the room for her. But Juliana said \"There's only girls here.\" She looked at me \"Well a girl and a half-girl\". I felt kinda of offended, I don't know if she does any of this on purpose, but still hurts. They both claim to support the LGBT+ community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last, 'thing' they did, is treat my house, mainly my room, as if it's a pig pen. Sometimes we will reunite to have a movie night and just to talk and we bring food. They, eat, like, pigs. They will eat with their mouths open making sounds and dropping crumbs and pieces of food on the ground. They have dropped soy meat on the ground and when I told them to pick it up they told me 'it's art' and left it there, laughing. The last time they were at my house I decided to tell them. As Sam picked a cupcake and began to it many huge pieces of it were falling on the ground. I told her to stop it. She questioned me on how since, according to her, that would make her stop eating. I told her to use her hand underneath the cupcake. She said 'my hand is not a trash can OP.'. I got angry but tried to hold it in. I told them to stop it again to wich they responded with 'OP is verbally hitting us''I don't treat you like this at my house'(Because I don't eat like a pig and when I drop something I pick it up)'What is wrong with you today?''Is your mother forcing you to do this?' I told them they were beigin disrespectful... they still didn't take me seriously. I didn't know what to do anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been also been told that my problems aren't as bigs as theirs. They've also called me 'exotic' when they were calling themselves 'beautiful'. Juliana is a vegetarian and Sam is a vegan and they ofeten offend meat-eaters, specially when I am around... I am a meat-eater and I try not to say anything about vegans or vegetarians around them as to not offend them, heck i don't even say anything about MEAT! And lastly, they have accused my mother of beigin 'jealous of them', my mother isn't perfect, but she is the person who raised me and is always there for me. I also always have to do what they tell me to do or else they get weird on me (mainly Juliana).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do... should I tell them I'm mad? Or should I end my friendhsip or what? I don't have anyone else to talk to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nMy friends bully me and don't take me seriously or respect me. But they are the only one that I've come out of the closet to and my parents are homophobic but still help me with my problems. I've got nobody to turn to.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Tomorrow is her birthday and she told her boyfriend that she would like to spend the night together but he simply answered her that he \"wakes up early the next day\" and to \"not be too pushy\".\n\nThe thing is she constantly tells me that she is sexually frustrated and that she would like to fuck someone (and specifically told me that she would fuck with me). I would be down to fuck her but that's probably the worst way to solve any of her problems, I feel like I'm the only who would get really benefited and I don't wanna mess up their relationship anymore.\n\nWhat would you do in my situation? What can I tell her? I think she has a toxic relationship with this guy, but also feel that I shouldn't judge them and butt in.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'll make sure I introduce myself properly once we meet! To make it short, I'm a man, early twenties, from eastern Canada, and I currently work a full time job as a programmer.  \n\n\nI'm looking for a... new best friend, maybe? I don't know much. I'm looking for someone with whom I can share interests and have exciting conversations with, someone with who I can enjoy my hobbies, someone I could get to know! I guess I'll list out some things I'd like to find in you? I know it sounds selfish, but... well, it's why I said it's an odd request. Well, here's a list of points on which we could match!  \n\\- Do you like video games? I've been all over Apex Legends recently, but I usually enjoy fighting games more. I've traveled to tournaments from coast to coast!\n\n\\- Are you into anime? I know I am! I'm enjoying Fate/Zero as we speak, it was recommended to me by a friend.\n\n\\- Do you dig IT stuff? I make a living out of it, so I guess you could say I love anything related to computers.\n\n\\- What about music? I tend to love a bit of every genre, but find my home in rock, metal and pop, mostly.\n\n\\- Art is your thing? I draw and play multiple instruments, so I'd love to exchange about that topic too! I've also done some writing work for roleplays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to mention an important detail... I don't know how to put it into words, but I like to build bonds with people that feel... alive, independent? I know it can be strange, but I tend to find myself get attached quickly to people who live through their passion and assert themselves. I like people who are not afraid to speak their mind, it makes things so much more lively! It's fine if you're busy with other things, other projects, other people, if anything, it only makes me look forwards to our encounters more! Some people can perhaps qualify assertive people as being \"bossy\" or \"bitchy\", but I find it enjoyable. Tension is a great way to shape personalities, they say!   \n\n\nAnother detail. I tend to open up better to women. I know it'll make me look bad to say that, but... I tend to feel uneasy exposing perhaps more personal and vulnerable areas of my world to men, despite my love for these juicy details. I don't know why, but it's something I'm looking into. I'm guessing it's because my best friends were always girls when I grew up? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, this was a very long post, and I apologize for taking so much of your time. Discord is my preferred way of communication! I hope to cross paths with people I couldn't dream of before today! See you soon! ", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Preferably someone in the 23 - 35 age range. As much as I would love to be able to message throughout the entire day, I find I tend to get busy and the thought of someone waiting for me to respond that moment gets a bit stressful. Whereas I can always have an email open throughout the day and add to it whenever possible or when I think of something new to share and then send it off later in the day. There's also something incredibly exciting about getting a 5 paragraph email and sitting down to read it all. It just feels like you get to know people at a deeper level and takes the pressure off both parties to instantly respond when they're in the middle of something. I'd prefer to chat on reddit first though and then take it to email if you want. I know it sounds old fashioned, but I encourage you to give it a try with someone, even if not with me. It's a ton of fun when both people are into it! \n\nI love reading or listening to audiobooks on the drive to and from work. Genre wise, I do like a variety but I tend to always end up in the fantasy section. Recently I decided to finally give Brandon Sanderson a try. I'm now around 200 pages into Elantris and am really enjoying it so far. I thought his writing would be more intimidating being such a big name in the fantasy world, but it's very easy to read and get into. I love anything book related and getting recommendations for new books.\n\nAlso related to books, I enjoy playing BookTube videos in the background quite a bit while doing other things. Lately I've been on a watching reading vlogs kick as a nice distraction from day to day life.\n\nNetflix is always great for background noise as well, though when I want to be more focused on a show, I like giving something in a foreign language a try.\n\nI do work full-time and take some classes in the evenings and online, hence my preference in writing emails over continuous texting/messaging.  \n\nAnyways if you are interested, I'd love to hear from you and get to know you! If not, then thanks for reading anyways and I hope you'll find the friend you're looking for!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I did have friends once up a time at University (not a total hermit) but they all live elsewhere now and I struggle to get out. \n* I am quite introverted offline (hence, no new friends) but I do open up when you get to know me.  \n* Online, however, is a different story and I will quite happily type for days.  \n* I'm very straight edge (no smoke, drink or drugs) but I don't judge anyone who does any of those things.   \n* I'm fairly easy going and open once you start talking to me but you will have to watch out for my sarcasm and cruel humour.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Some of my hobbies:-*\n\n* I like reading when I have time.

I met a lot of really nice people, some of which I'm still friendly with, but I feel like I'm still missing that deep connection and chemistry I had been looking for. \n\n\nI'm a 27 year old guy from the east coast USA. I've been very lonely lately, and I find myself more isolated than I'd like to be. I'm very open minded and extroverted when it comes to talking, and I thrive with deeper, more personal conversations as I tend to ask a lot of questions. That brings me to the title of this post.. I really want to make a meaningful, long term connection with someone that will hold me in high regard and make an effort to make me a part of their every day life, and vice versa. My life situation due to health and other issues has left me with more free time than most people, so I can promise I'll always be around to talk and quick to reply to your messages.\n\nSome key information:\n\n* I'm a big gamer/nerd. I've generally been successful with having relationships with people that don't play games, but it's a plus to me. Games make up a big part of my life and helped me get through so much, so if you're someone that understands or can relate to that, all the better! I play mostly on PC, PS4 and Switch. My favorite genre are RPGs, and specifically the Final Fantasy series holds a special place in my heart. I also play Destiny 2, League of Legends, Smash Ultimate, Pokemon, and the list goes on!\n\n* Music is super important to me. My go-to genres are pop punk, hardcore, emo and the occasional hip-hop album. I LOVE sending music back and forth on Spotify and finding new bands and sounds to sample, as well as going back and getting an ear full of nostalgia. I'm a 90s kid through and through, so I have a soft spot for the 90s and late 80s. If you've managed to read this far, if you message me with a Spotify link to a playlist, album or song that you've really been digging lately, that would be amazing!\n\nI have many other things I like talking about, but I can't spoil them all in this excessively long post, can I? ;) I will just mention that bowling is also a pretty big part of my life. I don't currently bowl due to some health issues, but I stay around the game and currently coach high school/youth players. It would be cool to meet someone I can talk about those things with too, but that might be a long shot!\n\nSeriously, if you've managed to make it to the end of this, thank you so much for reading and even considering messaging me! I would love to hear from as many people as possible, so don't hesitate to reach out, even if you stumble across this post weeks after I made it. I have a slight preference for talking to women, but like I mentioned, I'm very open minded, so age, sexuality, looks, or anything really doesn't matter to me, and I would prefer if they didn't matter to you as well.\n\nIf any of this resonated with you, send me a message!

Most of my friends live over an hour and a half away. I have a four year old and not many friends with kids. I have never been this type of person- I have always had a lot of friends and made them easily. But since I had a baby and had to stay home, move to a different city and my relationship seems like it\u2019s failing- I find myself spending most of my time alone with no one to talk to- or shall I say, no one I can really talk to. It\u2019s like all of the people in my life are too close or not close enough. So I find myself, imploding and becoming someone afraid of a simple conversation with someone new and always finding a reason why we couldn\u2019t be friends. Which has led me to convince myself that people don\u2019t care, won\u2019t car or like me. Which is sometimes easier to believe than trying to squeeze a friendship out from meeting someone new like juice from a hard lemon. \n My four year old is unnaturally friendly and could make friends with the grumpiest of hobos or snidest of housewives- (insert cheesy saying about god having a sense of humor), So I am forced to smile and nod to a vast number of characters everywhere we go- my face saying \u201c I don\u2019t like talking to people\u201d but inside saying \u201cplease look past my social awkwardness I really need some new friends\u201d. It\u2019s a lot to explain to a stranger that my full fledged social anxiety is new, well not new, but has  just come to the surface- and I am begging for someone not to judge my cards for their face value. I am constantly daydreaming of instances where I could be my best self for 30 minutes from the start- like a stray dog or a used car salesmen- bursting with unbridled enthusiasm. If they buy what I sell then I could be a lady. Ladies who lunch, or get coffee or do a combination of both at a park or some shit. They sit and talk about how they put gym clothes on but didn\u2019t make it to the gym- all the god damn kids birthday parties they have to attend- all wearing a wedding ring that catches the sunlight in just the right way. I would be the comic relief- like a character out of a mom group type comedy\u2019s ( bad moms, ladies night bridesmaids etc) who\u2019s always arriving late smoking a cigarette. She\u2019s not rich, not married, not skinny but she gives you a laugh and always has some sort of food on her face.

I befriended a girl a few months ago during lunch ( I'm a freshman, she's a sophomore). I thought she was a nice person, but I noticed that she is very demanding and expects me to give her all my attention and to hang with her all the time. I don't have many friends, and I hope I get more.. She would snag my food without asking, but I have addressed this with her and it died down. She expected a good Xmas present, but she gave me a used bracelet to \" save money for the urgent field trip\". I don't expect gifts, but the fact that she said she needed to save.. On Valentine's she asked for a gift, I didn't get her one ( she forgot) . She would occasionally give me her random leftover food, even when I say no. Expected me to help her with her hw  ( She asked me for help in a class I don't have) and she got pissed. \n\nI'm a female btw.. She is not a lesbian, I know for a fact she is straight ( I'm pan). I'm not attracted to her..\n\nOne day, I made a plan to avoid her, it worked briefly. I sent her a text saying that we should stop hanging out. After lunch, she waited inside my 4th period to curse at me, I remained calm. She interrogated me until I responded on the note she gave me. I wrote my response and she asked me for food and a hug. Wth??! I was trying to end the friendship but it failed. On another note, she has an IEP and has trouble making friends. Her case manager mentioned that a group of girls strayed away from her because of her aggressive behavior. When I was trapped with her, I didn't have time to spend with my other friend. My phone broke ( using a family member's) so she lost my number. I was trying to sneak away from her once again last week, nearly failed. She suspected something when I tried to drag my bud outta the room.\n\n\nHelp? I wanna be done with her, no contact. She is very childish. \n\nWhen she cursed at me she said \" don't you ever say those words \". She hisses too, when she let me play with her sticker book, she hissed at me when I asked if I could finish the page. Jesus Christ this bitch is crazy, I'm so done with her crap.

I also just feel like ever since I was a kid I suppressed most emotions and now they all blend to a constant \"ok\", I never laugh, I never cry, or get upset, just walk around with a numb familiar smile in my face, and this makes my friends and family joke that I'm just emotionless.\n\nI have trouble opening up and connecting with people, never have dated anyone, and most of my friends leave , and I feel like I'm not capable of making someone happy.\n\nSo now I'm finishing up college and I need to move out my hometown, in the first place it's because it's a small City and there's not a lot of opportunity on my field of work, but most importantly, I think it's a great opportunity for me to get to know me and explore life.

I don't know who to talk to or how to say what's on my head, but I need to make a decision and I thought \"some random person on the internet might be able to give an outside perspective\" and so here we are... \n\n\n\nTL;DR: I don't know myself, and I'm leaving town to try figure things out, should I go with my friends or alone?\n\n\nPS.

I wanted to get your attention as this is my first post! I'll try to make it short &amp; simple. I need helping weighing my options. My used to be best friend who is now my friend I talk with once in a blue moon is visiting from North Carolina. She didn't even tell me she was coming in advance. She just called me and simply said she is in California and is leaving in a few days. She is an hour and a half away from my town. I told her i would drive over to her for dinner after I get off work, which is at 6pm and I likely won't get there until 8pm. After I made these plans with her I began overthinking. Should I go all the way there after a long day of work just for a dinner? Isn't it kind of rude that she didn't let me know in advance that she would be here so we could make proper plans? Our relationship used to solely revolve around partying but now I am different than I used to be. I don't drink and I workout 5-6 days a week and maintain a pretty strict healthy eating lifestyle. If I see her I know it will be fun and nice to catch up but I also know I will be up all night drinking with her because that's just who she is and she is too fun to pass on that opportunity to party when with her. Do you think I should go? If I don't I will feel good about myself because I won't have to wake up with a hangover and have to recover the next few days and won't have to spoil my good diet/lifestyle of not partying. If I don't go, I may regret it as I haven't seen her in years and I probably won't have another opportunity to for another few years. Please let me know your honest opinions.

I'm friendly, outgoing, and people get along with me quite well, but things very rarely get to a deep level because of this. I just don't feel comfortable sharing that kind of thing with people in person, and I'm hoping that online relationships will help with this.

Rap, Hip-Hop, (K-)Pop, 40s/50s/60s, Funk, Metal, Screamo, etc. Bonus points if you got Spotify Premium, so we can have Spotify Sessions over Discord!\n\nArt is something I do too little of but would love to do more, though because of my incredibly busy schedule (and definitely not my laziness), I'm not putting in as much time into it as I would want to. Though I enjoy watching art shows. Huge fashion fan aswell though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI like watching Twitch/Streams (Soda, Forsen, Greek, Tyler), Netlfix (Friends) &amp; Movies. Huge fan of Horror. Romance, Action, Comedy, all that good stuff. Favorite Movies are the Saw Franchise &amp; the Batman Trilogy. Currently I'm just watching a lot of friends, though.\n\nCurrently I play League of Legends, Overwatch &amp; Dead by Daylight. I'm really heavily in the mood to play Saints Row 4, Resident Evil 5 &amp; 6, and Borderlands 2 + Pre-Sequel. So a coop buddy would be amazing! :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBig fan of things like Clubs &amp; Parties, going for walks, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI own a PC, a Switch, a 3DS &amp; a Wii-U.\n\nRoleplaying (ERP &amp; RP) is something I love to do, been doing it for ages now!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this and/or I interest you, feel free to send me a PM &amp; introduce yourself!

We bought a house, our son (infant) was in a good daycare. I was doing really well at the job and felt good about being in public service. We both had 8-5 hours and got to spend nights and weekends as a family. The weather was very nice, so we got to be outdoors every weekend. Everything was great...except my wife hated it. \n\nShe liked her job, but not her boss. The lifestyle was more laidback than where we came from. She called the people \"mediocre\". We were away from friends and family. I always said we could move back if it didnt work. She couldnt take it, and after 7 months, she broke, and we decided to move back. We took the first jobs we could find and got out of there.\n\nIt's been 6 months since we moved \"back home\" and I'm struggling. My job is worse, and I can't find a job in the public sector. I miss helping people. My wife's job pays more, but she works every other weekend and 2-3 nights per week. That leaves me 1 on 1 with an 18 month old, and I'm losing the battle. Winter is much worse here, so we're stuck inside every weekend. The house we bought isnt selling, so we're still paying that mortgage.\n\nI'm really struggling right now. I've struggled with depression my whole life and I've never felt comfortable here. Being in the southwest in a job i loved with my wife and son was the happiest I've ever been in my life. Being back in a place where i've felt like an alien my entire life, at a job where i help no one, and not getting to be with my wife and son as much is really getting to me. My wife knows im sad, and she feels guilty. Whenever i try and talk to her about this, i always end up feeling worse. She'll ask why she and my son \"arent enough\" for me to be happy? I think thats extremely unfair and something i never put on her when she was unhappy down there. She tells me to go see a therapist for my depression, but i dont think that's fair...wanting to be happy doesnt make me mentally ill. I asked why she never considered counseling down there and she said she wasnt depressed, she just really hated that place.\n\nShe's much happier here. Our son is still too young to know the difference. They're the only reasons i get out of bed anymore, but i dont think thats fair of me to put all of my potential happiness on them. They should be able to live their lives with my support, and not wondering if dad is gonna break down if i make him sad.\n\nIf you read all this...thank you. Truly, thank you.

You know, the kind liable to ask how your day is going out of the middle of nowhere and with whom you can exchange songs, dumb memes and deep discussions. Sometimes all at once. \n\n\n\nAs for what I am up to right now? Pretty unexciting, to be honest -  stressing about the future and wondering on the wisdom of dumping close to a grand on a plate carrier, because reasons \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\n\n\nPlanning on trying to join reserves, so am about as excited as it gets (/s) about doing basic training this summer, provided that I can get in. Also, incredibly-detailed paperwork is super fun (also /s). \n\n\n\n*If you are someone who is not going to bother reading the following wall, I encourage you to click the lil' X on top of this tab now. Thank you!* :) \n\n\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info (AKA full autobiography) about me:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian fluently.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate.\n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned career, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, which I am dealing with as best as I can - although recently, things have been on the mend - enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am somewhat stigmatized against the latter by some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not, in fact, a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandise and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed. \n\n- Gainfully *un*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work.\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Automata, WoW, DOOM, Bioshock, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. Honestly, for whatever reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nRight now, I am playing Battle Brothers, this roguelike tactical game about managing a mercenary outfit in a fantasy setting. Other than being infuriatingly-hard, it is good!\n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favourite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favourite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loathe cheap jumpscares they are so enamoured with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n\n- My sense of humour is possibly the worst, and I have dank memes ready for every possible situation and I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile humour. \n\n- My main hobby right now is Airsoft. I spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together since I ordered most of my gear from companies in Russia. I guess I really prefer quality, which is why I was willing to fork over money for real military stuff instead of more affordable replicas.  But at least the gear is quite nice and looks good. \n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I think it is time to give up trying to categorize what I like by genre, and instead do it by what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord) I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n\nRight now, I am super into Ghost, Pain, Marilyn Manson and .. Muse - if it is not obvious by this point, I am so edgy that I (used to) cut myself :D\nHere is a song that I like so much that I will listen to it on [repeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zx1ZtxUbGE) until I hate it. \n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%, due to a certain affinity for slithering neck-ties and positive human qualities like ambition, narcissism and general douchebaggery :D \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. Stuf like lack o punctuatuion impropar gramar to short n generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit.\n\nAlso, here are some pictures of [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), because why not? \n\nI prefer using Discord over anything else, but I like to get to know people on here before jumping in there. Please no Reddit Chats, I hate the UI. \n\nFeel free to hit me with your favorite ice breaker / shower question! (As long as it is not a Trotsky ice pick). \n\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I don't have favourite genres yet since I'm still experimenting with them. \n\n\n- Gaming has been one of my hobbies for as long as I can remember. Though, it's considerably less now. From time to time I do pick up games such as League of Legends, Overwatch, Blade and Soul, Black Desert Online. I play on PC and it would be awesome to have someone to play with every now and then. \n\n- Normal miscellaneous hobbies. Listening to music, some anime/shows. Actually went and saw Alita Battle Angel recently. I was hyped since it was from James Cameron, but I'M STILL WAITING FOR AVATAR 2! \n\nThere're the main interests I have, but I'm sure we can talk about a lot more. Open to talk about whatever.

We had a really great connection from the beginning and our friendship developed fast into one that we both often said was one of the best friendships we've had. \nTo cut the story short, for some time she had gone to a psychologist and things were awesome for her. Then she went on a 3 month work-and-travel experience. This is when she stopped going to the psychologist and started kida-dating this dude on tinder. They had a long distance relationship during her 3 month absence and since she has returned things have started going downhill. \nI really liked her relationship with this guy in the beginning, he was sweet and carring and she really seemed to like him. However, in a short period of around 2-3 months she started spending almost all of her time with him, always sleeping at his place as if she had already moved in. Me and another 3 good friends of hers started noticing how she would be always moody, always on her phone texting him (even on her birthday party, she would constantly text him instead of spending time with us). \nSo naturally, my initial support for her relationship started to fall dramatically. \nFast forward to today, my friend is the most distant I have ever seen her, she cannot concentrate on things for longer than 15 seconds, she spaces out for long periods during our courses, she is always tired no matter how much she sleeps, she forgets important things about our friendship, including appointments we make, she goes from very happy and excited to downcast and sleepy in the blink of an eye and she doesnt remember things like important talks or how much money she spends and it really has become a problem lately. \nShe said she took our advice and now she doesnt sleep at his place that ofen but they hang out every second of the day. Each time I ask her to go out somewhere, she already has plans with her bf. The whole week long. I've tried countless of times to suggest going back to her psychologist because I think her bf's personality is overtaking hers. She never quite speaks to us about him but she has some moments when she is quite clear and she says he's very introverted and insecure in many ways. He also isnt quite keen on studying. My friend who was a really good student, has huge problems this last exam session, with some exams struggling to pass. \nNow I feel like we're totally disconnected, and I did really try to speak to her about it but she gets really defensive and I cannot reason with her. Everytime I suggest something might not be right, she either tells me to stop judging her and that some people don't want to be saved or she gets very defensive of her bf even if I don't mention him. \nNow she's planning on going to America for 3 months with work-and-travel and she is suddenly fearful that they will break up because he might not stand the long distance relationship and that he might do something while she is gone. \nGuys... She would never ever talk like that in the past. She would never doubt herself, now she does. She used to trust her friends, now she doesnt. She was never the type to worry that she might get cheated on. \nThis has been really burdening me for a while now and it's getting hard to see her going deeper and deeper down. \nI might be overthinking this, but the other 3 close friends(and roommates)she has (we're all in the same  collegecampus  btw) think the same. She has gotten so far away from us and we've all tried having talks with her, nothing worked. \nSo please, any advice is hella welcomed. \n\nTLDR : A friend has gotten into a relationship that seems to have gotten toxic and she has pushed away all her friends ", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

What should I do?", "author": "dragonslayerthethird", "self_text": "Disclaimer: this is going to be a long one so sorry but this is really important to me but if you want the full details here I go:\n\nI(14 M) been best friends with D(14 M) since middle school. He was always someone I could trust and turn to vent out my feelings. We\u2019ve been through a lot like him having surgery and the crutches he had for a miserable 6 months, biking around town just being the rebellious preteens we were, summer camps, and just making jokes. D was quiet but always showed his true colors around me. I liked him for that and I think he genuinely liked me too.\n\nFast forward to freshmen year of High school. Things have changed. D and I don\u2019t have many classes together and he seems to have made some new friends(who were more popular than the both of us). At first, I was happy for him. I struck up some conversation with these new friends but they brushed me off or just stopped talking to me. They gave me that glare like I was inferior or something. However, they loved talking to D. \n\nGranted, I\u2019ve never really been the extrovert in school. I\u2019m a bit geeky for math and history and short as well as generally unattractive(I\u2019m Asian and 5 foot 4). D is of mixed ancestry and athletic and admittedly handsomer. He is also an excellent swimmer who has qualified for national meets. \n\nI noticed the changes slowly. D kept talking about girls being hot. I mean this is normal for all teens, but he would go out of his way to talk to them. He stopped meeting me before school to talk to some cheerleader chick and said he would do track only if there was a hot girl there at all times. No problem, I thought. I mean, I would too i guess. D also started being less straight forward with me than usual. I\u2019d ask him a serious question and he\u2019d be like \u201cIDK\u201d or just turn away in silence. Sometimes I would interject myself into a conversation with him and a popular person just to fit in. D would just ignore me and continue, which wasn\u2019t like him to do. Before long, D started getting invited to events because of his connections to the populars. He\u2019d been chosen to do an event in the class assembly(basically a school pride event). \n\nOne night, I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I opened up snap geo maps and saw he was in a popular girls house with a bunch of other populars. I immediately got jealous. D was posting pics of him with a girl on his story like he was bragging about it. He usually never posted on his story. He sent a total of 5 snaps at this house, which was irregular(he barely used social media). The next days, I asked him about his interactions with the populars and he just shrugged and did that same vague behavior again. He doesn\u2019t text me anymore and doesnt start conversations anymore(I have to start them). \n\nAt this point I have a dilemma. I see 4 options here:\n\n-I will continue to be his friend or at least try to. I mean I don\u2019t think he hates me but I guess he doesn\u2019t have time for me anymore. However, this option will make me depressed and make me feel unwanted(he is my best friend in the world after all).\n\n-I should tell him how I feel. I think this option would be awkward and I could face backlash if he tells his popular friends. He doesn\u2019t seem to want to listen to me seriously anyway.\n\n-if you can\u2019t beat em join em is what my late grandpa would say. I could try to infiltrate the populars just as D did. However, I don\u2019t have the charisma or the courage and might get shot down miserably. I have already set my reputation as the nerdy Asian who has good grades. I want to be myself and not try too hard though. \n\n-I will stop being his friend. This one hurts the most. I\u2019ve known him for years. I feel like we can fix this somehow.\n\n\nAt this point telling him how I fell sounds the best. I don\u2019t know though. I\u2019m going to ask reddit and see. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Here's a little about me:\nI'm  29 and from the Midwest(US). I'm working on my Master's degree in psychology and between work and school, I have become pretty isolated. I've grown apart from the few friends I have since they've become equally absorbed in their own lives. And now I have fewer and fewer opportunities than ever to meet new people. I'm feeling pretty socially starved and have been pining for friendly companionship. I've heard of people on here finding just that.\nWhat I hope to discover is someone that I can share both the mundane details of daily life with and maybe the deeper aspects too- I love philosophical speculation. I'd eventually enjoy having enough familiarity with someone that when they mention that one person, situation, or scenario I'll have enough foreknowledge of them as both a person and their circumstances that it will have meaning and context. I can reply in a way that is not just an, 'Aw that sucks' or ' That's cool' but as someone who has a real vested interest. Of course, some of the same in return would be amazing. Our conversations can be as in depth or light as you'd like.\nSome of the things I like and hobbies: I'm a musician and spend a good deal of my free time writing music, recording, and playing. I'm also am a pretty voracious reader of both fiction and non-fiction, although partial to good science fiction and horror. I enjoy have a lot of interests aside Psychology including Sociology, Anthropology, History, Philosophy, Biology, Ecology, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and the city when its possible. Less seriously, I like laughing and joking around the most and would hope to find someone else who does too!\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

A few days ago I contacted them and asked them why saying I don\u2019t know what I did. They said that I did several things that didn\u2019t sit well with them, particularly telling my roommate, at the time, that they peed in her shoes. I didn\u2019t do this. I told them this and said I didn\u2019t know how they came to that conclusion. Basically, last year some liquid was spilt in my roommates shoe over the weekend and we didn\u2019t know who did it. We didn\u2019t even decide it was pee. During that weekend, I got pretty drunk and this friend brought me back to our room and cleaned up my puke. We ended the school year never finding the culprit. \nOkay, back to the story, I then proceeded to ask what else I did that was wrong, but they said they didn\u2019t have the energy to list this things out. I then contacted my old roommate asking if we even concluded it was pee and she said no/asked why. I explained the situation and she said \u201che asked me last semester and I specifically told him you didn\u2019t.\u201d If my own roommate defended me, why didn\u2019t he want to believe it?\nIn addition, I don\u2019t feel like I was really a bad friend. I listened to him vent, paid for his cab fare, went with him to parties, paid for his pizza, and wrote him a long birthday message( after the incident had happened) telling him how much I appreciated him. Furthermore, looking back at our messages, a month after that incident, he contacted me asking to live in an apartment with him and his friends next school year. He was like \u201cwe really want to live with you.\u201d I wrote him a message saying how I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m choosing to live in a single.

I can't put it into words but that just blows my mind.\n\nAlso fun fact that blew my mind, it would take 19 years for a commercial airplane to reach the sun. That's almost as long as I have lived.

Someone with an ideal they were willing to strive for; a part of themself they held-firm for someone special. Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of option, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person.\n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers).\n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values).\n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

I have met many amazing people through the friend subs, and I\u2019m looking to meet some more now \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI make my living as a musician. Though I primarily teach piano, I also perform and accompany when the opportunities present themselves. Though initially grad school was my planned future, I have slowly moved away from that idea and am leaning towards embracing the teacher lifestyle. But, since every effort to plan out my future seems to be thwarted, who knows where I\u2019ll be 10, 5, or even 1 year from now!\n\nAs a musician, you might imagine that classical music is my greatest passion and biggest interest. I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything better (though, sex and food come close right?). I\u2019d absolutely love to meet some people who are fellow classical musicians, but I know that\u2019s a pretty specific thing. My favorite two composers are Ravel and Shostakovich, but I like almosttttttt anything. I still can\u2019t embrace serialism, but I try to keep an open mind!\n\nFollowing classical music, video games are probably my second biggest interest. I\u2019m a Nintendo guy and always have been\u2014it\u2019s what I grew up on. Paper Mario: TTYD, Zelda WW, and the original Metroid Prime are among my most favorite games. Over the past few years, a friend has got me into Dark Souls, which is an amazing series. I have a love-hate relationship with League of Legends, and I\u2019m currently on a 6-month+ hiatus. I\u2019d kinda like to make it permanent, but I always seem to come back.\n\nI am quite familiar with clinical depression, having spent the past 6 years in various states of up and down. Over the past 6 months or so, I\u2019ve finally made some real and deep progress that has required a lot of time and effort and love. There\u2019s still more to go, but I truly believe I\u2019m finally on the other side of this monster. So I can definitely related to anyone who has or has had problems with mental illness. It sucks, but it can be overcome with enough resilience and persistence. I still have my bad days (though rarely!), but I\u2019m finally working on the underlying issues.\n\nThat\u2019s most of the big stuff, so how about the smaller stuff? I am gay, I have two wonderful Malshis (maltese/shih-tzu), I\u2019m very particular, purple is my favorite color, I am currently watching Dexter (the serial killer, not the scientist), and I\u2019m currently playing Smash Ultimate. I was raised very much as a Christian but have since become a liberal agnostic, lol.  I don\u2019t drink or do any drugs.\n\nEnough about me, though. I have a few things I\u2019m looking for in a potential friend. First, I am not interested in flakes. I\u2019m not here to chat for a day or two and then vanish. I am only interested in people who want to make a legitimate friendship and form a lasting bond. Second, our primary means of communication must be through texting/iMessage or (less preferably) Discord. I don\u2019t really enjoy letters/emails, and I\u2019m not that great at keeping up with messaging apps. Third, you must be 18 or older (out of high school). Finally, I prefer that you live in the US for the sake of time zones, but I am open to meeting people from other places. It just makes it more difficult to keep in touch.\n\nWell, thanks for reading. \ud83d\ude0a Please message me if you\u2019re interested! I\u2019d love to get to know you. And just so I know you actually read my post, tell me what your favorite kind of pet is and why. Have a great day!\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

There are some people I have in classes that I feel I could become good friends with, but I don\u2019t know how to start. \nTo start, I have really never had friends since 3rd grade. When I was younger, I had 2 friends that was more than enough for me. Then I grew separated from one, and the other moved across the state. Since that point on, I was never able to find others that actually enjoyed my presence. I tried to slowly make friends, but I was always treated as an outsider. I, therefore, have incredibly low self esteem, a lack of friends, and am lonely outside of school.\nAnyhow, background over, I was hoping to have some help creating friendships. I was told that eventually someone would come that was perfect for me. Now I am starting to worry no one will be that without my effort. I have a couple of people I feel confident in becoming good friends with, but I lack the tools to do so. Here are some of the people I hope to become friends with....\nOne of them is really understanding, but we have little in common. Last year he was one of the only people who understood issues I was dealing with. I would love to have him as one of my friends that is reliable through everything at a moments notice, but I don\u2019t know why he would come to me. It may be my low self esteem, but I see nothing in myself that is desirable. \nSecond one is his sister. She is the same way as her brother, but I would like to have a whole friend group (not that one isn\u2019t enough, it most definitely is). I never really felt uncomfortable around her, and she seems very open, and it would be nice to see her more often. I don\u2019t want to become her boyfriend though. \nThose were the two main people I feel I most confident that will become good friends. I really appreciate any and all help you guys could give me.

We could even sleep call together after watching anime or twitch streams, if we become good friends like that.\n\n\\-I want to tell you everything about my day and I'd love to hear about yours as well\n\n\\-Once I get to know you, I want to tell you about what's important to me and I'd like to know what's important to you.\n\n\\-I will be there for you through the good times and the bad times (I try to always do my best to have your back) and I want you to do the same for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really, really want to find someone who will be a best friend and do the same things above for me. To me.. these are common characteristics of a good friend and of someone who genuinely cares, yet it's so hard to find these days and I don't know why. The above description is how I am just as a person once you give me a chance and get to know me by talking to me on a \\*regular\\* basis. I am looking for someone who is the same way!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Please have similar interests as I do -- in terms of friendship and the video games I play/stuff I like to watch (refer to the link).\\*\\*\n\nI don't want to keep having to lfg to find people to play 1-2 games with and then never get to talk to them again because they don't know that friendship is a 2 way street and I can't be the one to keep initiating conversations. That just isn't the style of friendship that makes me happy. I'm honestly ready to find one person who I can just hang out with and be myself around. I prefer quality over quantity and I'm looking for someone who feels the same way!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I just got all 4 of my wisdom teeth out yesterday and the only upside to it is the ice cream lol. If you're wondering what my favorite flavor is, it's cookies and cream. \n\nI like to read autobiographies, thrillers and fiction. My favorite genres of shows/movies are comedy, thriller, psychological and action. My favorite shows are GoT, The Office, The 100. I just started watching Lucifer last week and I love it so far! My favorite movies are Gone Girl, the HP series and some from the Marvel franchise! Recently I've started to listening to podcasts. If any of you that could  recommend one to me to listen to, I would greatly appreciate it! \n\nI play the guitar and the piano. I love to listening to music a lot. I vibe with all sorts of genres, but I mainly listen to R&amp;B. My favorite artists are Frank Ocean, Khalid, Joji, Billie Eilish and Brockhampton. I like to play video games when ever I have the free time. I game on the PS4 and the games that I'm currently playing are Warframe, Apex Legends and Paladins.\n\nIf you would like to chat, I would just ask you to **please PM and give a little intro about yourself.** I just ask for you to be around my age, preferably 18-21. I don't really care as for gender.  \nI prefer talking on Discord, since it's my preferred way of communication, as I'm not a fan of messaging on here. If you don't have it, that's fine as well.

Sorry for format, on mobile. \n\nAround 10 years ago, I began to go through one of the roughest patches of my life. GF left me. Mom was diagnosed with cancer. I started pushing away / lashing out at long time friends for, what I perceived at the time, were slights against our friendships.  I was beginning to feel left out of thee loop on events, began ignoring calls and texts. In my immaturity, I lashed out on social media about these things. \nThey rightfully cut me out of their lives and I was left to mostly deal with what was going on by myself. \n\nAbout a year later, give or take a few months, I managed to loosely reconcile with one of them and felt regretful for the way I had acted. I tried to reach out to the others through this friend with no avail. I tried to find them on social media, but they had either blocked me or never had it to begin with ( they were not a fan of any sites when we hung out). So I thought, well, I\u2019m not sure what else to do, and gave up for a time. \n\nAfter my mom passed, I felt more alone than I had ever felt. Aside from my fianc\u00e9 (although we were still long distance at the time), I had no one but family to lean on. My thoughts drifted back to old friendships and I tried her again to reach out, only to fail. \n\nFast forward to the present. I\u2019ve since married and moved across country. Ive made new friendships where I\u2019m at now, but I still wonder about these old friends. I\u2019ve even had dreams at times about reconnecting with them. I want to apologize to them personally. Want to make sure that life has treated them well. However, after all this time, I wonder if I should just move on, as I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve moved on themselves. \n\nTL/DR; I pushed away friends 10 years ago and still wonder if I should try my best to reach out and apologize or move on. \n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

It has gotten me in trouble before but I assure you it was nothing that could be considered \u2018rude\u2019.

And I suddenly think to myself. What if I am in a coma and this is all dream created by my brain. What if I wake up and end up being a 60 year old lady called Sally that likes to have more cats than she'd like to admit. It was safe to say that I was having a midlife crisis in the shower.* \n\nDon't let this scare you off from sending me cat picture. ~~Yes just cat pictures, perverts.~~ But don't call me sally or I'll force feed you like every grandma ever.  \n\n***Introduction*** \nEither way, I am Zack a 21 year old student from the Netherlands. Currently studying psychology. I guess that technically makes me a psychologist? ~~A self proclaimed one~~ So I am always willing to give advice or to be a listening ear to a problem that you have. ~~But please don't sue me~~ On a serious note though, I am not a professional just yet. So if you're facing some serious problems don't hesistate to get a professional involved.\n\nI am a professional however. A professional at creating terrible situations for myself. Just like the other day, I was so confident in my navigation abillities. Let's just say the world was not as confident in them, considering I went wrong and had to use google maps to arrive at my destination. Google is like an angel looking over my shoulder. ~~While collecting all the info of my search results~~ Very cool Google-sama. \n\n***Hobby's*** \nSo I am a pretty big fan of sports, especially football. The one where they actually make use of their feet. ~~Cough Cough sorry American Football fans~~ But since I don't have enough time to play it, I stick to fitness instead. Other things that interest me are ***True Crime Shows***. It's just something about them that fascinates me. ~~I am not a lunatic I promise~~ I also enjoy listening to music. ~~No shit sherlock.~~ The music I listen to varies, depening on my mood and what I am doing. But it's usually rap. Though just between us, all I have been listening to as of lately is funky Japanese music from the 80's. Anyway this post is getting too long as it is, so I'll try to finish quickly. I occasionally game and watch anime. But uni + work makes it relatively hard to do both each week.\n\nThen again it's not like I do much else in my free time. Since I am not really a \"going out\" type of person. I enjoy smaller groups of people a lot more or to just chill around with friends. But I am not a fan of parties and clubs. Which seem to be every students air, parties and clubs. Something about clubs just makes it an obnoxious experience for me. I mean you can love them. I won't judge. But I just wanted to give a heads up. Also before the punny guys and girls come over, I am not talking about clubs used in softball! However, do send me all your puns and memes. A laugh a day keeps the anxiety away, no? ~~Douchebag anxiety, visiting without prior notice smh~~ \n\nExcuse my spelling mistakes and send me a message!

She did it because I found out she was talking shit about me to my ex boyfriends.\n\nSee this one guy was a \u201cfriend\u201d of hers before we started dating and when he dumped me he pretended like I abused him (I housed him for free when he was homeless, helped him get re-enrolled in school, helped him do his homework assignments, and spent hours counseling him through his disordered anxiety.) He was chatting up other girls behind my back and when I caught him, he literally packed up all his shit and refused to talk to me again within a few hours. Then a few months went by and I heard through the grapevine that he was telling people that I was obsessively catfishing him through multiple accounts begging for nudes and that my friend was agreeing with him. I was shocked, mortified, and felt such betrayal. When I confronted her she said she just told him what he wanted to hear cause he\u2019s so unstable. But ever since then she was cold and distant. \n\nA few weeks later she insisted on coming over in the middle of the night. She comes through announcing that she fucked another one of exes from years ago and spends HOURS giving me details that I awkwardly just endure. Finally she ends it all by asking me to basically admit that Im a crazy catfisher cause she\u2019d totally do it and I can tell her anything.  I had just started my career and was extremely busy all the time and i had recently gotten into a new relationship too, so i really didn\u2019t have the time or the care to pull off such an elaborate stunt. Ten years of friendship and she was trying to get confirmation on bullshit gossip about me that I refuse to believe she actually thought was true.\n\nAfter she left, I remembered that a few years ago we swapped Instagram log ins because she wanted to stalk some guy who blocked her. So I logged into her account and basically found her talking mad shit about how I\u2019m so annoying and crazy to my exes as painfully obvious attempts to get into their pants. She was literally hitting on them in the same breathe as putting me down. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes, but I didn\u2019t confront her. I told a close friend about what I saw cause I had to talk to it out and eventually it got back to her.

Here we met g and the 3 of us instantly cliqued, we became close and had a \"clique\" comprising of g,m and me. Then a couple of months into school, i notice that g and m were constantly whisperig to each other, texting a lot, basically they knew stuff about each other which i did not. Having had numerous shitty friendships in the past, i began to distance myself from them. I also overthink a lot, so i kept thinking it was because of me.\n\nWell during this time when i distamced myself from them, they got even closer and were begining to behave like a couple(G already has a bf) they acted worse than couples which made things extremely uncomfortable. Things like \"m follow me to the toilet, i need to pee\" were almost a daily occurrence. Anyone who heard g say that always had a wtf look on their face.\n\nFinally i mustered up enough courage to confront them and talk about my feelings. Long story short, g started liking this other guy (WHILE STILL IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER BF) and was talking to m about it. As they were talking about this all the time, the became closer. They saw that i saw distancing myself andprobably needed space. So they further distanced themselves from me which made the whole thing worse.\n\nAnyways after talking to them, things became better (kinda).\n\nFast forward to this year, g and m already gotten super close. Whenever my other friends or i would hang around them, g and m would constantly be whispering. On top of that i was often treated as invisible, while we were together as a clique.\n\nIm missing out a lot of details cause theres too much but thats roughly the gist of it.\n\nBack to story. So i started getting extremely uncomfortable, annoyed and rather jealous. I was annoyed that we were suppose to be a close group of friends but it always ended up being about them. So i started distancing myself from them, talking more with other people, getting closer to other classmates. I got particularly close to a guy who i shall refer to as J. J and i and quite a lot in common and was genuinely a nice guy. I started spending more time with J and gradually cut off contact with g and m. This was the healthiest thing for me as the constant feeling of jealousy, betrayal, being ignored around g and m was detrimental the my mental well-being.\n\nThen today, i was sitting behind g and m in lecture and over heard their conversation\n\nG: did we even to anything to him? Whats wron with him? He's like a washing machine, no shit to stir but want to stir shit\n\nThe last comment really made no semse to me at all. How am I the shit stirrer? I did nothing to you i never told anyone your secrets (i have a couple which can really really embarrass them) while g started spreading that i liked some girl, but i only mentioned it once that i eyecandied her. Thats it. Never talked about the girl but somehow word spread to people in class that i like this girl\n\nI dont know to feel pissed, sad or betrayed. \nI hate my life in school\n\n", "subreddit": "friendship"}

So today, my heart was literally crushed. My very close friend suddenly became sad, and when I approached her, she said \"Don't touch me\" in a very annoyed and angry way. Before that, she was typing something on her phone, I approached her again to see what she was doing. Normally, if she didn't wanted me to see something, she will just cover her phone. But this time, seeing that I was approaching her, she quickly turned off her phone and walked away, annoyed. I really don't know what happened to her. Other people asked what happened, and she took them to some places where I couldn't hear them talk, and I could see that she was looking at me while talking. It really breaks my heart. And when she cooled down a little, she approached my desk (annoyed, once again) and in a very serious/angry way she said:\"If you're wondering if I'm okay, I'm fine.\" And then she quickly disappeared. Later this day, I forgot to go to dance (it's a long explanation, but we just go to the same dance club everyday), and another girl peeked from the classroom and whispered:\"Come here!\" When I went in, I started apologizing for not going there, and that girl said that I don't need to apologize, but when I saw my bff's face, I almost broke into tears. She looked at me with a really pissed off gaze. Normally, she will just shrug it off, or at severe cases, say \"please don't do that again\", but this time it was really different.

I\u2019m looking for a friend / a group of friends to get to know, with the goal of hanging out on a regular basis.\n\nA little bit about me:\n\nI\u2019m  28, male, live in the Pacific Northwest, and am very laid back. I love  intelligent conversations as much as I do silly ones! Having fun with  friends, being there for friends, and having friends be there for you  are my pillars of what friendship truly is, and what I\u2019m really looking  for.\n\nMy interests include games of all  sorts (PC, tabletop, pen &amp; paper, you name it!), animation, film,  writing, reading, a dash of youtube here and there (Yogscast, Quill18, a  few others), and in the past I have GM\u2019d for games like D&amp;D.\n\nI  get along with pretty much everyone, the only exceptions being hostile  or aggressive individuals. I love smart, kind people, people who are  non-judgemental and enjoy the experience of chatting, and having fun  together.\n\nPeople and groups that are  like-minded tend to get along best, so here\u2019s me dumping a wall of words  of some things I classically like, or recently have taken some sort of  interest in, just so that maybe anyone looking at this post can get a  read on what sorts of things I might be into, or be likely to get into! -  Battletech, Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse, Lego, Elite Dangerous,  Monster Hunter, Roguelike games, Beer, Food, Yogscast, Conventions (of  the nerdy variety), Mobile Frame Zero, Apex Legends (normally not my  type of thing, but it\u2019s made by the people that made Titanfall! Which is  dear to my heart), Science and Science-Fiction, Fantasy, D&amp;D (and  other roleplaying games), Traditional Games (tabletop/board/card games),  Game Design, Writing, Animation, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more so I\u2019ll edit  to add more to this as it comes to me!\n\nWARNING, CONTAINS TRACE AMOUNTS OF:\n\n&gt;!Liberalism.  I am very open-minded, and try my best to not hate anyone or anything. I  firmly believe everyone has a right to be happy, and as long as what  they are doing isn\u2019t hurting anyone else and it brings them joy, that\u2019s  good. I find peace in life trying to get along with as many people as  possible, like as many things as possible, and be accepting every chance  I get. This sort of thinking definitely makes me lean liberal in many  senses. I thought it was worth mentioning this to anyone that might  care, as the world we live in today is very politically charged. If you  voted for literally anyone but Trump, yay! That\u2019s about as political as I  get!!&lt;\n\n&gt;!MLP.  Yep! It\u2019s just a show that I like- wait, don\u2019t run away! I love the  show and parts of the community, and have met some truly wonderful  people along the way because of it, but I don\u2019t talk about it unless the  other involved party is open to it or also into it. I realize it\u2019s not  everyone's cup of tea, and would never try and push it into the current  conversation at hand unless they too wanted to talk about it. I make a  point of not being annoying regarding it.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Honestly,  to open up about something very personal, My Little Pony helped me get  out of one of the worst depressions I\u2019ve ever had. That particular part  of my life was the only time I had ever come close to ending it. But,  fortunately, discovering the show at just the right time, finding the  community it had, and meeting a ton (and I mean a lot) of the people  that have worked on the show over the years has been an amazing  experience, and turned me completely around! But my being into the show  is also a big part of why I no longer have a close circle of friends.  People can be judgemental in honestly perplexing ways, and my liking  pastel, cartoon ponies apparently rubbed a portion of my friends the  wrong way, due to this (and a smattering of other judgements) we no  longer talk. Some of those friends were ones I had since childhood, so  it was quite a soul-destroying experience. I\u2019ve since rebounded, but  going from having people to talk with nearly every day to going it solo  for years definitely has taken its toll.!&lt;", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

In the beginning of our friendship, we did everything together. We even went to prom together. Once she went off to school and I stayed home to attend a college closer, she became friends with some girl who constantly disrespected me, (talking bad about me, making it known she was annoyed that I was calling, and trying to make me look like the bad guy to my friend) and I\u2019ve never met her, and my friend never said anything to this girl about it or defended me. Soon after that, this guy I was talking to, tried talking to M and telling her, he was only talking to me because he couldn\u2019t get with M originally and she never told me. I then ended up going through an abusive relationship and my ex at the time, wouldn\u2019t allow me to have my phone, go home, eat or anything. I called M to get $10 to eat something while he wasn\u2019t watching me. She never responded. She later told me she didn\u2019t help me because she \u201cthought I was on drugs and you can\u2019t give a crackhead money.\u201d (sn: which is so far fetched because I don\u2019t even smoke weed or drink, so how I could possibly be on any hard drugs? but whatever.) Then as time went on, two of my exes would always comment on how \u201csexy\u201d she was and show interest in her, while I wasn\u2019t around and AGAIN she never told me. she accepted the compliments. she says she never said anything to me because \u201cit\u2019s not her place and she didn\u2019t want to ruin my confidence.\u201d Add in: her telling me I wouldn\u2019t graduate from college until my kids did and we actually ended up fist fighting. I\u2019ve tried to cut her off several times, but she always ends up trying to be friends again and I feel bad but I just don\u2019t trust her or generally like her. I don\u2019t even know why but I just don\u2019t.

I'm hoping for female friends, but I am not closed off to male friends if you can respect that I'm *not* looking for a relationship. I mainly use snapchat but I do have kik and skype.\n\nI'm liberal leaning and while I'm okay with you holding your own beliefs, I am not sure how well I'm going to get on with people who are fundamentally different from me in some ways.

He's my ride or die buddy! I enjoy reading and listening to music, and can recommend songs and have songs recommended to me for hours on end. I also enjoy video gaming and I play on the xbox and would enjoy chatting/playing on there with people. \n\nI am just looking for a best friend, really.

I've had a few good and close friends, whom could spend hours upon hours talking to regarding almost anything, but for various reasons over the years, we all split apart. And right now, I'm living with my spouse in her home country (Finland), and the language barrier makes it rather difficult to establish any connection beyond being a work acquaintance. It makes it feel a bit more lonesome than it probably is. I usually preferred having a small tight-knit group or even just a single friend over a huge group. Always felt like a more important part.\n\nI consider myself a bit of an introvert, in so much that I am reluctant to reach out, especially in crowds or online (so this is a biggie for me!). It has usually ended with no response, something that disheartens me. But once I get to know people, I open up quite a bit, I typically become the guy that talks and asks a lot of questions. I am equally interested in your thoughts and ideas, as I am having you being interested in mine!\n\nI'm a typical nerd, I suppose.

Pretty unexciting, to be honest -  stressing about the future and wondering on the wisdom of dumping close to a grand on a plate carrier, because reasons \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\n\n\nPlanning on trying to join reserves, so am about as excited as it gets (/s) about doing basic training this summer, provided that I can get in.

Thank you!* :) \n\n\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info (AKA full autobiography) about me:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian fluently.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate.\n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned career, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, which I am dealing with as best as I can - although recently, things have been on the mend - enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am somewhat stigmatized against the latter by some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not, in fact, a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandise and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed. \n\n- Gainfully *un*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work.\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Automata, WoW, DOOM, Bioshock, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. Honestly, for whatever reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nRight now, I am trying to find another game similar to Darkest Dungeon.. and I am not having much luck.\n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favourite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favourite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loathe cheap jumpscares they are so enamoured with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n\n- My sense of humour is possibly the worst, and I have dank memes ready for every possible situation and I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile humour. \n\n- My main hobby right now is Airsoft. I spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together since I ordered most of my gear from companies in Russia. I guess I really prefer quality, which is why I was willing to fork over money for real military stuff instead of more affordable replicas.  But at least the gear is quite nice and looks good. \n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I think it is time to give up trying to categorize what I like by genre, and instead do it by what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord) I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n\nRight now, I am super into Ghost, Pain, Marilyn Manson and .. Muse - if it is not obvious by this point, I am so edgy that I (used to) cut myself :D\nHere is a song that I like so much that I will listen to it on [repeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zx1ZtxUbGE) until I hate it. \n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%, due to a certain affinity for slithering neck-ties and positive human qualities like ambition, narcissism and general douchebaggery :D \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. Stuf like lack o punctuatuion impropar gramar to short n generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit.\n\nAlso, here are some pictures of [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), because why not? \n\n Please no Reddit Chats, I hate the UI. \n\nFeel free to hit me with your favorite ice breaker / shower question!

So instead she just contributed a little bit of money ($50) towards the hotel (her way of giving a birthday gift, I guess). \n\nWhile she is correct in that I was planning to go alone and absorbing the cost on my own, the fact is that this is not a work trip and the cost is coming out of my pocket.

It was a group of 6 girls, and 2 guys including me. The other guy ended up leaving though, leaving me to be the only dude, which was totally fine. We all became great friends, but one of the people I met-- we'll just call her Jane-- was really cool and we became *super* good friends. 3 years later, Jane and I still talk and play video games nearly every single day. We started to joke about how we're each other's internet spouse, and at first I was cool with that, but now she's actually starting to act like it. She doesn't like when I talk to the other people in the group chat at all. The other day, Sarah, Jane, and I were in a call on the group chat and Jane left to get some water. Sarah and I started talking and she turned on her camera to show me her puppies. Jane got back, and heard me laughing and talking about a show with Sarah, and she said something like \"Oh really?,\" completely ruining the mood and causing Sarah to go quiet. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love Jane. She's a great friend, but I feel like she's ruining my relationships with my other friends. I know the common way to deal with something like this is to talk to the friend about it, but Jane is the type of person to take everything *way* too personally. She's holding a slight grudge over me for asking her not to spam call me during work, and for not calling her for a week when I had a fever after studying my ass off. She knows that Sarah and I confessed to each other a long time before I even knew her, and she gets super aggravated whenever I mention Sarah. She trash talks about Sarah to me a lot, and sure, there are some things I can agree on, but she's my really good friend and ex best friend, so it kinda hurts me a lot.\n\nI know Jane has a lot of problems with personal things, and she get's super depressed and cries a lot. So, I feel obligated to put up with her, and that's definitely something you shouldn't feel when talking about a friend. I feel like a punching bag babysitting a toddler, and if I tell her to stop hitting me she'll cry, so I just have to put up with her until I'm literally destroyed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso wanna mention something that she said that literally tore me up inside. We were all playing some pvp game, and I was jokingly telling everyone to do certain things if they died, i.e., stub their toe, stuff like that. I told Jane if she died she would have to eat her dog, and I don't know what her intentions were, but she responded with something like, \"You know a lot about that considering you clearly already ate one.,\" Implying that I ate my dog who recently died of a disease. I replied with, \"You just went too far.,\" and she got mad at me for saying that.\n\nAny form of help would be appreciated.

When we were kids we did everything together but as we got older, we sort of drifted apart. I\u2019m two years ahead of her so I started middle school first and started getting new/more friends and growing as a person, developing interests and stuff. We still kept in touch though, as we\u2019re neighbors and our whole neighborhood group always hangs out on nice days when everyone\u2019s home. \n\nThis continued until my late junior and senior year of high school, where we got super close again because we rode the bus together. We would walk up together every morning and hang out at my house almost every day after school doing homework. And we hung out nearly every day over the summer, which was super fun.\n\nThen I started college. The new school schedule, plus work, plus new friend groups, has led me to drift apart from her. It\u2019s both of our faults, but probably mainly mine, because in my free time I\u2019d rather be hanging out with my other friends than her. The thing is she is always busy when I try to make plans, yet blames me for never talking to her. And when we finally do have plans she will forget about them and not come over.\n\nIt\u2019s super easy to just say \u201chey come over\u201d and have her walk 30 seconds to my house to chill and watch Netflix or do homework, but for some reason I never want to do that anymore. I think I\u2019m just generally drifting away from her, because the more she becomes her own person the more I see things in her that I don\u2019t like. For instance, she\u2019s always been kinda rude to me, but it\u2019s grown significantly since starting college (that\u2019s probably a factor as to why I don\u2019t wanna talk to her much anymore). Another thing though is that she\u2019s getting wild (not really, just having sex and smoking weed, typical teen stuff) but in my mind she\u2019s still a baby. I just feel a sort of responsibility over her and I disapprove when she does those things. I\u2019m straight edge as hell, but it doesn\u2019t really bother me if my other friends smoke, because I feel no responsibility for them.\n\nAll ranting aside, we\u2019ve drifted apart and the more I try to talk to her or make plans she never responds or pushes it aside. She used to complain that I never did this, that\u2019s why I\u2019m putting in effort to hang out, but she\u2019s over it at this point. \n\ntl;dr I\u2019ve drifted apart from my childhood best friend and neighbor and I feel conflicted because I thought she would always be in my life, but I\u2019m starting to not like her as a person that much anymore  ", "subreddit": "friendship"}

But i felt like i need to put this out there so that if i do end up finding some one to become friends with, they know a small fraction of my life. I genuinely want to make friends, I want to break out of my shell and meet some amazing people. so i'm going to take a huge leap of confidence and put this out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi, I'm 22 yrs old, I live in Illinois and I'm having hard time finding cool people to make friends with. I've been teaching myself how to use video and photo editing software because I would love to one day make music videos for small or underrated artist. I'm hoping that one day if i get good enough i can make a living out of it. I also hope to make music one day but i figured i should take baby steps and learn one thing at a time. I only have one person in my life that i can talk about art related things to, but their always busy. This isn't something that I need, but it's always fun to get somebody's opinion or even nerd out with someone that is fond of the arts. I'm not the best gamer but I love playing video games nonetheless, one of my favorite all time games is Horizon Zero Dawn and Flushed Away The Video Game(I'm not even lying I had loved the movie when i was a kid and it was the first ever video game that i was able to beat, so it holds a special place in my heart). I've also recently just got into warframe but i stop playing it because i didn't have anyone to grind with and I figured it would be more fun with friends. I'm also very big into movies, i love to critique movies for fun, i love to watch bad movies so that i can i shit on them, i love getting into debates about films, to sum it up, I love movies. I also love to talk about anything, no discussion is closed to me. I just always have something on my mind so being able to rant or talk about whatever topic to anyone is always good. I also love to hear other people talk and rant. Just listening to someone go off about anything is the best thing ever. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, I hope i didn't say to much and bore whoever is reading this. I didn't even read any of the post that are on here, I just found the subreddit, so i figured i should say something for once. I'm also super ADHD so forgive me if this post is all over the place and grammatically incorrect.  I just hope that this post can find someone that relates and if you need a friend or someone to talk to, I'm here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nok here we go. ", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

She likes to have a good time and HAS to go out on Fridays because it\u2019s her day off of work and watching her son, as he stays with his dad. We usually hang out with the gang at local bars and chill, sip casually and enjoy each other\u2019s company. However, Kelly as she is rowdy, is very confrontational and will react to anyone giving her \u201cattitude\u201d or if they give her a \u201cdirty\u201d look, she loses it. \n\nShe had told me in the past she has issues with anxiety and anger, because any time she is \u201ctriggered\u201d, she takes physical action. Especially if there is alcohol involved, her fuse is very short. It has come to the point where she is so wasted sometimes she will get physical with whoever tries to reason with her, which is usually myself or one of our friends. I understand ppl react differently but this has been an on going thing for months now and it almost happens every time we go out and drink. Which she drinks heavily, even if we\u2019re just having a chill night, it turns into binge drinking til 2am. \n\n\n\nWe are in our mid twenties and that kind of behavior can land her in some trouble. \n\nHow do I confront her about taking a break from alcohol to really get a grip on her other \u201cissues\u201d?Should I tell her that I can\u2019t be friends anymore because I\u2019m usually always the mediator in the bad situations and it causes me a lot of stress and honestly I feel sad for her because I know she doesn\u2019t have the best home life situation. She is also very stubborn and will completely brush off any advice I try to give her about taking a break from alcohol and talking to a professional that can help with her anxiety?\n\nDo I back off or keep insisting she makes a change?

A lot of the time when she tries to touch me or hug I can smell sh** on her hands.\n\nOn top of this 50/50 x we use public toilets l\u2019ve noticed she doesn\u2019t wash her hands. I\u2019ve been given the explanation that she doesn\u2019t want germs from touching the soap dispenser... I\u2019m confused, if I can smell it, why can\u2019t she?? And if we\u2019re at a bar or at the cinema she starts to pick her nose a lot which grosses me out when we\u2019re sharing popcorn. \n\nHow do I tell her to stop doing this in front of me &amp; wash her hands without being mean and embarrassing her?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm looking someone to chat with and, hopefully, a friend. It doesn't matter if you're male, female, old, young, white, black, gay or straight. Everyone is welcome to chat with me!\n\nA bad thing about me is that I don't have many interests except for classical music, sims, science and academic trivia. However, I'd want to and very open to pursue new hobbies, anything except for obviously illegal or immoral ones. Recently a friend of mine has introduced me to anime and other music genres such as country, hip hop and rap, surprisingly I started feeling quite interested in those.\n\nOther things I can provide you are my hospitality and my desire to long term chat with people. I really don't want to ghost anyone so if you have a tendency to be ghosted, you don't have to worry about it when you have a chat with me.\n\nI think that's enough for my self-introduction. Again I'm willing to chat with everyone here so you can leave me a DM if you want.\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}
