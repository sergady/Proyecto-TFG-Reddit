As I suspected, the two week agreement for them to stay kept getting extended until he wanted them to live here for over two months - rent free. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Lets other friends (that I don't know) stay over for days when he's not here but I am. Doesn't seem to realize (or care) that it's incredibly uncomfortable and awkward.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Borrowed my car, got into a minor accident and didn't get the other persons insurance info. Came back with a messed up bumper and told me he'd pay for it, which he never did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Helped him move for 8 + hours. When it was his turn to return the favor he helped me for 20 minutes and I had to move 80% of my shit alone during a rain storm. Always has an excuse when I need similar favors. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Now wants to buy a pool/ping pong table to put directly above my living space and genuinely doesn't see anything wrong with it.

Maybe I\u2019m mentally broken. Maybe I don\u2019t think like everyone else. I can\u2019t control my feelings sometimes and therefore I over react a lot. I\u2019m depressed. Broken down. I feel over worked, over stressed. I hate myself most of the time. I find times to live and laugh but those times never make things worth it. The only reason my life doesn\u2019t end is I\u2019m afraid, afraid to hurt the ones who say they love me. Sometimes I wonder if they do. If they don\u2019t understand how I think how could they. I\u2019ve been to mental hospitals due to psychotic freak outs from what I think is anxiety. I\u2019ve been wrongfully diagnoses by a broken medical system, I\u2019ve been mocked by police force for not being a man enough to control my emotions during my freak-outs. I\u2019ve seen multiple therapists and psychologists who never seem to find the right mix of meds. Marijuana helps but now because I like that I have to be discriminated against by employers and neighbors who may find out. Just another way I have to live in secret. I\u2019m bisexual so I guess I should be used to keeping things secret. I thought I was turning life around. I became pretty stable after meeting a great woman, my now wife. Shes my everything. I\u2019ve tried everything I do to control my freak outs and aggression so I don\u2019t scare her and make her angry. She doesn\u2019t deserve it. She doesn\u2019t deserve me. I\u2019m too selfish to let her go. She makes me better, I think. She has some medical issues which have racked up hundres of thousands of dollars, that and dealing with her and our mental health departments trying to get us help has ruined my faith in the American healthcare system. I got a job with benefits, I moved out of my parents house this year. Renting an apartment off my dad... baby steps... and I feel like I\u2019ve been in hell ever since. I was bullied a lot all throughout school. I never fit in.... never felt normal always bullied and stepped on. The fat large white kid whose picked last at sports. And now I\u2019m at a place where I\u2019m being bullied again. Never would I have thought In my adult like I\u2019d be bullied by a 55 year old woman but I constantly let her get the best of me. I asked her one day to please not have her dog use the bathroom in front of my front door on the pavement of my new place I\u2019m very proud of, well she decides to leave me a nasty note along with wiping spit on my door that she assumes I left In front of her front door. I don\u2019t spit ever. It has started a battle that has made its way through multiple police calls for her stalking us, peeping through windows, harassing is over the fence, calling us names, spreading false rumors about us. and driving me down the deepest depression hole I\u2019ve ever been in. Did i mention she\u2019s also a teacher, just like the asshole teachers who never gave two shits about actually helping kids in need like me. I\u2019m sure she bullies and gets under the students\u2019 skin too and they\u2019ll grow up just like me, resenting people like her. Wishing there was a way to live with happy like minded people instead of living in a world of hatred that people like her infest... and I\u2019m in no way perfect so do i belong here? I blow up when people like that get under my skin. People like me are the ones who end up snapping and hurting people. I could never hurt people before i hurt myself though. I\u2019m not that selfish. I\u2019ve tried filing a restraining order which was a 7 month process, a waste of money. And resulted In a biased judge who only cares if people get physically hurt by their tormenters. My tormented lied her ass off in court and fought her son to do the same. She got almost everything dismissed as circumstantial despite her admitting to wiping spit on my door. Nobody cares about anyone\u2019s feelings anymore it seems. Nobody cares how they treat people I\u2019ve now lost faith in our legal system. Did I mention I worked at a jail? Where I see mental patients like I was at one point who made one wrong mistake and now have to live their life in solitary cells speaking to themselves with little to no actual mental health care. So there goes my faith in rehabilitation services for criminals. Some don\u2019t belong there and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be me one day. I just hope I have the balls to take my own life before doing something stupid that would end up landing me in jail becoming a burden to society. I feel anyone who wants to leave this earth should be able to do so in peace with praise. But I guess that\u2019s just me. It gets better? Yeah I\u2019ve heard it.  So basically fuck our education system for not preparing me for life.  Fuck our healthcare that rapes us, fuck the mental heath division that keeps closing hospitals and sending them to jails, fuck the corrupt private jails I\u2019ve had to work for who treat their inmates like animals. Fuck the legal system that has let me down. Fuck the police that never have helped me and have laughed in my face while I cry and beg for my medications. Fuck the judges who grant continuances for defendants of restraining order when the person seeking protection goes through more hell. Fuck them for being biased towards a woman of their own age who lies her way out of court. Fuck everyone who doesn\u2019t understand like the HOA who refuses to help make this woman leans me alone.  fuck you bullies, teachers, judges, cops, parents, doctors, pastors, therapists,  and anyone else who has wronged me. You made me what I am. A monster to society. Someone who wishes he wasn\u2019t here but can\u2019t ask for help because I\u2019ll just get thrown back into the same system that has hurt and betrayed me.

And unfortunately I can\u2019t quite think of a tldr due to the subject and depth of my issues.\n\n\nNew Year\u2019s Eve and the holidays in general have been pretty tough for me this year. I\u2019ve recently had the cops called on me as my ex believed that I had become a serious threat to myself. I\u2019m currently suffering through depression and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just the after effects of recent events in my life or if it\u2019s something more chemical. \n\nThe reason the holidays (New Years Eve specifically) are difficult is because New Year\u2019s Eve is the anniversary of my dad\u2019s death and it hasn\u2019t been the same since. I\u2019ve spent many nights sitting in front of his grave crying my heart out and wanting to just rip it out so I could see him one more time. \n\nI\u2019m a needy person, I learned this quickly through high school and my first year or two of college. Currently it feels as though there\u2019s not a single person I know that I can comfortably talk to about what I\u2019m going through. I\u2019ve always been more comfortable talking with a complete stranger as they have a completely unbiased opinion when coming into the situation to try and help or just be there. So if you\u2019re someone who can handle a needy person who feels like he needs someone to talk to 24/7 (until I fall asleep each night) it would be amazing to get to talk to you.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that I tend to talk about myself a lot in conversations as well despite trying not to so I can keep the conversation more balanced when talking to someone but sometimes I just feel the need to get so much off my chest. Again, if you think you can handle talking to someone like me then please don\u2019t hesitate to shoot me a message or something.

I hate all of it.\n\nI hate it because not only winter brings more depression than i already have, and i hate having to deal with that feeling. But i hate it also because every year, it's an occasion for litteraly everyone and everything to remind me that i wasn't wanted by my parents and that my brother is the preffered one and much more successful than i am.\n\nEvery year i get the \"you can wait until christmas for your birthday presents right ?\" and every year, it's a disapointment. Not only because i have the feeling that my brother gets more stuff (he's born in march so my parents cant trick him on his presents) but also because every year he seems happy with his presents while i'm completely disapointed by how my parents cant figure out what i like and they offer me stuff that i either dont give a shit about, or completely hate (my dad knows i'm an anti apple guy and he tried to offer me Steve's Job autobiography; i didn't even get it out of the package and told him to keep it for himself).\n\nEvery year's also the occasion to remind me that my social life is nearly non existant. Last year, i was invited to a party of acquantainces, and i believe it was out of pity. This year should have been the same, except they cancelled at the last moment. I tried to see for other plans but never had any answer. I ended up being playing PUBG with random folks on New Year. While everyone else was partying and stuff. And i didnt had that much fun to be honest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery year's also the occasion to remind me how my sentimental life is a shipwreck. Every year i get the occasional \"happy new year\" text from my ex fianc\u00e9e that manages to have a different boyfriend every time somehow. Friends and acquantainces are also finding SO. Some even got married and have babies by now. Meanwhile, i'm here sitting on my chair, trying to write how desesperate i am on reddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year, i hoped my health would get better. But it somehow got worse.

Plot twist : it doesnt help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven at things where i used to consider myself good at, i'm barely average. I feel closer to computers and my other stuff than people.

In any case, I have a splitting headache, cold and overall in a miserable state. \nNot to mention a very mild hangover from celebrating New Year's overly enthusiastically. \n\nIn any case, here is some basic info about me, as I still am trying to learn the art of being concise:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian fluently.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate.\n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned career, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, which I am dealing with as best as I can - although recently, things have been on the mend - enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n- Living with my parents for financial convenience - yay! :D\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am somewhat stigmatized against the latter by a some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not in fact a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandize and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed. \n\n- Gainfully *un*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work.\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Auromata, WoW, DOOM, Bioshock, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. Honestly, for whataver reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\nI have not really been playing anything seriously for a bit now, so looking for new games to sink my teeth in.\n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favorite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favorite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loath cheap jumpscares they are so enamored with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n- My sense of humor is possibly the worst, and I have dank memes ready for every possible situation and I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile humor. \n\n- Super into airsoft at the moment - spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together, but at least I seem to finally getting into the swing of things: went to play last Saturday, and not only did I get my first non-melee kill, but my K/D ratio was.. not negative. \nNow I just need to get my AK fixed. \n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I think it is time to give up trying to categorize what I like by genre, and instead do it by what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord) I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n[Here is *my* Christmas carol for 2018.](\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TBpNtmanZ1Y)\n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%! \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. That goes for stuff like lack of grammar and improper punctuation to short and generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit.\n\nI prefer using Discord over anything else, but I like to get to know people on here before jumping in there. Please no Reddit Chats, I hate the UI. \n\nFeel free to hit me with your favorite ice breaker! (As long as it is not a Trotsky ice pick). \n\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

She constantly tries to one-up me, insult me, she hates the attention that I get from guys, she constantly tries to flirt with the guy I'm seeing, plus she does a lot of things that I morally don't agree with (infidelity, leading people on etc.)...it's just not good, folks.

She recently purchased a car, but has not learned how to drive it in the past 4 months of having it. I am honestly concerned that she will just never drive. \n\nMy main frustration is that if we ever want to hang out, I can't just make plans and meet up with her...I always have to pick her up from her house. She lives 20 mins away from me, so about 40 min roundtrip when I go pick her up. She lives in a small town, so we always end up back in my town to hang out or my house and then I have to drive her back home. \n\nLately I have become more annoyed by this. I feel bad for being upset, but I'm tired of her not being independent. All of my other friends have cars and licenses and it's always stress free and not a hassle to hang out with them. I have offered teaching her how to drive and she always comes up with an excuse as to why she can't or doesn't want to practice. She has always seemed bothered by the subject matter, so it's hard to talk to her about it. She's a good person and a fun friend and I know I can't tell her how to live her life, but it's upsetting that she never offers me gas money or any type of compensation...but most importantly I am just tired of giving her rides :( am I wrong for feeling this way?

We are now in our mid 20s and have started careers. A few years ago, one of my friends started to become very pedantic and constantly corrects me. He corrects us on little things such as grammar or our attitudes on things. My other friends stay quiet or just go along with his behavior. I live much more nonchalantly than he does. I can also be a stubborn person and I'm always speaking up against his pushiness. This leads to some heated arguments. Sometimes I don't look forward to hanging out with him because I know he'll start correcting me. Some tings we repeatedly argue about are:\n\nHe hates it when I text words like \u201cwanna\u201d or \u201cgonna\u201d He says it\u2019s lazy because you wouldn\u2019t email or text your boss those words, you should spell out the full words. \n\nHe despises small talk. If I mention, \u201cdid you hear about so and so\u201d he\u2019ll give a speech about how he already heard it and we don\u2019t need to discuss it any further because it will be mundane conversation and will waste our time.\n\nHe constantly says he doesn\u2019t like simple people. He'll critique me if I say I enjoyed a generic action movie like Olympus Has Fallen because I should be better than that. I say, \"to each their own\" or \"live and let live\u201d. That bugs him and he again says we should be better and not to waste our time\n\nIf we forget something and ask something like, \u201cwhat time are we meeting again\u201d he gets very frustrated because we already went over it. He\u2019s gotten so frustrated that he\u2019s called us dumb and lazy for not remembering things if we\u2019ve already discussed it.\n\nHe likes to repeat things he\u2019s learned from readings and podcasts. Some if these things are clich\u00e9 such as surround yourself with useful people or people who serve a purpose. He also says you are who you hang out with. I agree there is some truth in those sayings but it makes it seem like I am not good enough for him.\n\nBoth my friend and myself have noticed that I'll act more timid or nervous around him. This is probably from the constant correcting or his criticism. He then goes on how he hates weak people and how it won't get you far in the real world. He constantly talks about how there are alphas and betas, which really annoys me. I've also noticed how much more I come out of my shell when he's not around. \n\nWe've discussed before how I don't want to be corrected by him and that if I want to learn, I want to do it on my own and not get a lecture from him. However, sometimes we can't hold our tongues for as long as we want and start to bicker again. I tell him not to be my parent, teacher, coach, etc. but he says he\u2019s hard on me because I am the most driven. I guess that a complement but I no one wants to be constantly corrected, especially when you\u2019re just trying to have a good time with friends. I\u2019ve mentioned that other people such as our other friends and family don\u2019t act like this but he says we have to be better than them because they are probably simple people.\n\nSorry if it feels like I\u2019m venting. I probably am but I have to get it out of my system.  He is still one of my best friends and I know he will always has my back and I will always have his. I hope this is just some long awful phase he's going through because I can't take this forever.

I guess I am here because i pretty much have nobody to talk to. anytime i ever talk to anybody they eventually end up leaving early as hell (maybe a month or so) and they always tell me they won't leave and pretty much say exactly what everyone else says. so since that has happened to pretty much everybody i talk to it kinda forces me to bubble up my emotions and well now i am here. looking for somebody that i can talk to. i have an issue with myself in that i absolutely hate myself, but i also believe i am probably one of the greatest people alive, yes i know i sound narcissistic right now and that's not intentional. I love and hate myself at the same time. as much as i want somebody to talk to and want somebody to express my emotions to i cant help but feel like im annoying or im begging for attention when i know im not. im so fucking lonely its gotten to the point that im like adapting to being alone and now im like isolating myself from my family. if i sound like a typical depressed teenager i assure you thats not it. ive tried going to chat rooms with people just to talk and i cant do it. its almost like i completely know how to talk to people, i just dont know how to find them. even this doesn't really make sense to me. im hoping that after some of you read this you happen to be smarter then me and understand what is up or maybe enjoy how i speak and wanna talk i dont know, i just needed some place to talk.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Just trying this again cause no one stayed, or they honestly had no time or were not compatible. Or they were out of my timezone. I need someone with time to voice chat with me. I really want to talk not type.\n\nHello I am 30 years old From Christchurch, New Zealand! and I have no sexuality. I have Autism (I hate it and want to be cured) and some intellectual/learning disabilities and physical impairments, also extreme anxiety. I live in a program for adults with special needs where I get to live on my own and care workers come to me each day. I am an author and write mostly Children's stories... I have not been writing since becoming lonely. My life is pretty complicated you can read some about it here.

Oh **animals**. I am also Christian. (And very loving/accepting), but I rarely ever talk about it -\n\nI play **Elder Scrolls Online**, and sometimes **Runescape 3** and currently hold a completion cape in Runescape 3 :) I also played Red Dead Redemption 2. But had to stop when my TV broke. I am not really a big gamer though, I am very selective if I ever play a game.\n\nI am not really a geek just kind of like some geekish stuff. I just enjoy it for what it is and don't live in it or study it :-) and I guess I see the world a bit more magical than most people...\n\nI am often described when people chat to me as chatting to a 12 year old, I don't know if this is accurate but maybe it will help? I Don't swear. Talk about anything sexual, watch r rated movies... drink alcohol, smoke and have never touched any illegal substances. I know this makes me boring to most people but I hope someone out there might like to talk with me.\n\nJust want a friend who has time to voice chat sometimes, but has to be someone appropriate. Most of all, **someone who has time.**  Please know, I am not after help or \"someone to listen\" I really just want a friend to talk to sometimes. Maybe about games or toys or lego or pokemon, and someone who will message me. As sometimes messaging others is hard for me. (Starting conversations) -\n\nI don't want to touch discord if I can avoid it... Everyone who has ever added me to discord has disappeared. Or been to busy playing video games to spend time with me. I would prefer **skype** for voice or some other program if you know one? I also have Email that I check every day and reddit messages.\n\nI am so lonely.\n\nThank you and apologies to anyone who feels they wasted time reading this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: I bolded a bunch of words in this post but I don't remember why.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I've made friends from work and playing games, mainly guys, so I would love to make more girl friends. My first time posting so I'll try to be as detailed but brief as possible.\n\n* I have started to get back into reading. I'm set of goal of books to read this year, though I haven't exactly picked out what those books are going to be yet. Suggestions are welcomed!\n\n* I like a wide range of music from varying genres, languages, and times. I think one of my favorites are the 80s and 90s like The Cure, Cyndi Lauper, Micheal Jackson, TLC, Aaliyah, Aerosmith, etc. I also like Mowtown artists. Most people here seem to like k-pop a lot but I prefer Korean artist like Jarium, Rocoberry, Lee Jin Ah, and Nell. I also listen to Japanese artist like Shiina Ringo, Ling Tosite Sigure, Plastic Tree, ABC, etc. Also a special mention to Broadway and some opera.\n\n* I'll watch just about anything that's on when it comes to tv. I cut cable so I usually rely on streaming services. I spend time watching Down the Rabbit Hole on Youtube or Are You Afraid of the Dark on vrv. Parks and Recs is one of my favorite shows along with 30 Rock. I also like watching some reality tv shows like My 600lb life, Drag Race, and Kitchen Nightmare. I like crime shows like The First 48 and Cold Case File. I sometimes sit through watching Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig when watching my niece and nephew.\n\n* Other hobbies include playing video games, mainly PS4. I have some multiplayer games, though not very many. I used really be into model building and miniatures. I haven't really had much time for that hobby. I like history and languages. I used to be in love with ancient Egyptian history in middles school.\n\nI think I'll cut it short here since it feels like I'm starting to rant.I don't care about your background but I'm definitely hoping to meet other girls 20+ If you're interested please pm me.

It pretty much always goes like that little. He absolutely refuses to try and defend his side of things at all.

I put on an old skateboard video that I\u2019m really nostalgic for recently, spawned by the release of the film Mid 90\u2019s. I told him beforehand what this film meant to me, and he all but laughed it out of his face. We walked around Boston and I was wearing a shirt with a pot leaf on it, and he practically forced me into a thrift store to buy another T Shirt. We once took acid in a hotel room and he basically kicked me out of our motel room to walk the cold streets of NH for an hour to f*** his girlfriend. Then later, he suddenly started f***ing her again in the bed next to me.  He didn\u2019t even ask me if it was okay!  iThese complaints might sound petty but man, I feel like my ride or die should swallow their pretentious pride and watch a 30 minute skate video with their homie. Accept me for who I am.\n\nFrom his side, his main complaint is that I am not clear in how I communicate. I do not give enough information upfront, that he needs to keep following up with questions. \n\nIf I\u2019m digging all the skeletons out of the closet here, I\u2019ve borrowed like a total of $1,000 from him, but have paid back all of it. I have also come at him with some significant crises in my life and maybe applied too much pressure or something, I don\u2019t really know. \n\nI need some outside perspective on this. We\u2019re taking a few days\u2019 break from talking because we got pretty heated with each other last time.  \n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m gonna end our friendship, but should I tell him or just take the coward\u2019s route and block him from all forms of communication?   \n\nThe snapping and snipping at me has always been routine and par for the course with him. The disrespect and lack of interest is new \n\nHe has been like a brother to me, but I\u2019m tired of being a whipping post. ", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I've been on this subreddit for about a year, but I thought I'd give it a try again. I've met some pretty cool people from here, so why not come back?\n\nAbout me:\n\n- I LOVE art!!! It's my biggest passion, and I do pretty much everything. Mostly string and bead art at the moment, though I'm trying to get into doll repainting. \n\n- I'd like to think I'm friendly. I've never been told I'm not, so I guess I am :)\n\n- I play some video games, but they're all single player sadly. At the moment, I love slime rancher, super hot, mirrors edge, and Skyrim. I don't play super often, but when I do, I play on Xbox. \n\n- I play guitar, but I'm not very good, just trying to get better. Practice makes perfect, I suppose. \n\n- I also play Ukulele, started about two months ago and I'm actually doing well!\n\n- Music is a huge part of my life. I'm listening to something almost 24/7. Mostly indie or alt music, but I really love EDEN, but I dont know if he would count as indie, alternative, or just pop. \n\n- I love animals, so if you have any pets, I'd love to see. \n\n- I do get pretty stressed sometimes, so I might have to vent every one in a while. But I only do that with people close to me, so it'll be a while until that would happen. \n\nWhat kind of person I'm looking for:\n\n- Preferably someone older than me. Anyone even a year older. I'm not good with younger people :/ \n\n- A guy. I just seem to be a lot better with guys. \n\n- Someone who can actually hold up a conversation and won't just answer with \"k\", \"yes\", and \"nah\".\n\n- A person who won't just ghost me, if you don't wanna talk, you can just tell me. \n\nBut yeah, thanks for reading, and hopefully you'll message me!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

So if you like to live life dangerously, maybe the mix isn't meant to be.\n\nMy mood constantly fluctuates, and i'm never sure when i'm what mood. Though, i'm living a good life for the time being, so i'm not as depressed as i have been. I've been deep.\n\nNow, with that  out of the way, here are some things that interest me:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love writing. It's a passion of mine. Frankly, the largest one i have. I like to write metaphorically, and i like poetry (A lot).\n\nAt the same time, i also have large interests in philosophy and psychology. My dream is to become a therapist, and i can take rants if you need a shoulder to carry you :D I love helping people out where i can, so don't hesitate.\n\nI have always wanted to learn to play an instrument, but i have serious dedication issues. This is also why i don't have many friends. I'm a picky person, but once i stick by someone, it's serious.\n\nI LARP. Yep, foam swords and all, very interesting. I want to get into board RPG's like DnD, but i haven't found the right people.\n\nBut nonetheless, let's move on.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy memes. Every single one, i'm up to date with them all - It's my party trick, if you will.\n\nI play a lot of games, mainly Stardew Valley, Minecraft, Sims, Overwatch, Destiny, and i play Fortnite, but really only Playground and Creative, i don't like competitive games that much. Games consume most of my spare time.\n\nI love deep conversations. I can easily skip small talk (In fact, i'd be happy to.), and go straight for soulsearching and peculiar conversations. I'm passionate about mortality, it intrigues me a lot.\n\nI want to add more, but it's midnight, and i know i'm bound to forget something. I'd love to chat with anyone, even if you're completely different. I believe anyone can be a friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTalk to me on Whatsapp, Discord, Imessage, Email, skype, instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, pretty much anything you can think of. I never post anything though. I'm on Discord 24/7, and Whatsapp is where i talk to most my friends. So those two are preffered, but don't let that stop you :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll edit if i think of something crucial.\n\nThank you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

What could I do to change myself?", "author": "Deillix53", "self_text": "Okay, so my friends and I are the \"elite\" a.k.a the cool kids our age in high school and all town. I'm not so popular but I fit in with them. At summer we always hang out, workout etc. I was bullied at middle school a lot so I'm not very confident, I'm shy and quiet, I was sometimes called \"the nice guy\" but it wasn't a problem with them, because I knew them since kindergarden. Not until the end of 2018, when my friends started hanging out with other kids, inviting them to their home and always forgetting me. I was sick of being forgotten or as others call it \"the tag-along friend\". So I asked one of my best friends from the group is something wrong with me? Have I done something wrong that yall push me out of the group? And they act like they didn't mean to forget me. But they do. They always tell everyone a secret except me, so I think the secret is about me and i get quiet. Today I was in a school trip with my class and the same thing happened. We were at McDonalds and I went to the bathroom. I then went back and heard them making fun of me that im quiet all the time. They were saying \"I think not everyone will talk with the girls at the bus\" and laugh, \"wait who is that kid in the bathroom? Whats his name? I think it starts with a P\" land laugh. (My name is Dominic btw.) they all came to me and stood there quiet and laugh quietly looking at me. Someone said loudly \"its pretty quiet here\" and all laughed. But I don't understand why do they make fun of me and act like nothings happening.\nIn my opinion they just use me and then treat me like shit, because i'm a \"great friend\" when it comes to helping in tests, borrowing a couple of bucks, helping with computers. But they dont do anything good or useful to me.\n\nIn all, I'm an inconfident person. I know I need to change, but I don't want to lose my so called friends, because there are 4 more years of high school left and I would always be depressed without no friends. Fu*k, i'm depressed I never had a girlfriend. It's a hard time for me.\n\nP.S I never had a best friend. All of my friends were equal and the one who wast best of the best, didn't have the same feelings for me. Like what I mean is I was never someone elsed best friend.\nThats a lot to read lol.

So if you are into horror that's a big plus!\n\nAs for other interests, well I'm into gaming. I generally play on pc and ps4, but I do have older consoles I play on as well. I generally enjoy Rpg's and horror themed games, but I do have some multiplayer games, like killing floor 2, overwatch, starcraft 2, and a bunch of others, just ask if you ever want to game. I enjoy reading as well, mostly fantasy, horror, sci-fi, and some history books. I'm slowly making my way through my Brandon Sanderson backlog after finishing up the mistborn trilogy. I also enjoy hiking and exploring places out in nature.\n\nAnyways, I'm just scratching the surface and didn't want to drag this post out too long.

I am Bun, a 26-year old lady from North America, nice to meet you.\n\nI am looking for people to talk to or even play games with over real life or online. I am quite an introvert and enjoy most of my time watching shows on Netflix/Youtube, finishing pages in an adult colouring book, sleeping, play online games, and drawing. I go out whenever my coworkers and I have planned an outing together, but the majority of my free time I just stay at home and do my thing.\n\nI am a pretty chill person... I can come off as shy at first but when you get to know me, I can be very talkative. I have been told to be funny and caring as a friend. I am a non-confrontational person and when something bothers me, I usually keep silent and let it pass. But there are times when I speak my mind by writing a letter. I can be quite moody. Sometimes I talk a lot, sometimes I just disappear off the face of the earth to just be alone. I have low self-esteem and I apologize a lot.\n\nAnyway, I like meeting people from all around the world and learning about their culture. When I connect with someone, I make sure to respect them and get to know them without being intrusive. I value people and their thoughts and when I get close to someone, I try my hardest to keep them as a friend.\n\nSome of the things I like are: Brooklyn99, anime, manga, The Crown, the Good Place, bears, bubble tea, dogs, online games (League of Legends, Borderlands, SIMS), sleeping, books, food, and MEMES.\n\nI have lost so many friends last 2018 and that was really a sad moment in my life. But, I guess everything happens for a reason. I would really like to meet new people and become friends with them. I hope that includes you, the reader. I am not good explaining or introducing myself since I can be quite awkward and senseless but, I hope to hear from someone soon.\n\nHave a good one and nice to meet you!

I\u2019ve been doing it for probably 7 years if not more. I\u2019ve been doing it as a hobby for all these years but are finally starting to get some paying clients. For paid work I mostly do wedding photography and as a hobby I\u2019m doing a lot of night photography.

My goal is to become a translator (if the photography business isn\u2019t working out). I\u2019m majoring in English but will add Japanese soon as well. \n\n- I love games. Both video games and board games. Right now I mostly play on my Nintendo Switch. On there I play smash bros, splatoon and fortnite. \n\n- I love animals, especially birds for some reason. My bf and I have two lovebirds and they\u2019re really living up to the name. They\u2019re so cute and cuddle together all the time (most of the time, they fight too). If you\u2019re my friend, be prepared for bird pics! \n\n- Festivals fascinates me as well. I haven\u2019t been to a ton of them, but my dream festivals are definitely Burning Man and Tomorrowland. I love everything about them: cool clothing, good music, awesome people and sometimes nice art works.\n\n- Vandwelling is one of my newer interests. I dream of owning a van one day and living a minimalistic lifestyle. I spend a lot of time on YouTube watching other people living that way. \n\n- I love traveling and it\u2019s in my mind every day.

I lied and said it\u2019d be the same and we lol\u2019d it off. It was a lie, from my side as i think it\u2019d be sweet if we did. But I don\u2019t want her that way. I told her after on Facebook and she said it\u2019s best we stay friends, and that it\u2019s ok and things will be fine. \n\nNow we hardly talk, she doesn\u2019t answer my messages, she is going through things of her own too, but partly i feel i have let her down and that she may think i desire her. She was honestly one of my best friends and I miss her. She\u2019s had a tough year and so did i and we helped each other out. She was the Karen Page to my Frank Castle. ", "subreddit": "friendship"}

She persistently finds the negative in everything that happens in her life, and seems to enjoy pointing out negative things in others lives too.  I find that after spending time with her I leave feeling deflated.  Were it just a relationship between the two of us I would not continue the friendship.  \n\nWithin our wider social group her negativity has been noted, and while she is invited to group occassions (due to a common hobby) most do not spend any 1-2-1 time with her.\n\nMy main issue with ending this friendship is that our boyfriends are close friends (also for 5 years).  Both my partner and I have a lot in common with him - gaming, diy, food festivals, beer festivals.  This means that the four of us spend quite a bit of time together.  Unfortunately she does not enjoy these activities and sees them as 'things boys do', and expects me to therefore be solely focussed on her.  My partner is aware of this and does what he can to relieve the situation, but finds her as tasking as I do.  Our group outings end up split by gender and I find myself watching the guys have fun while I listen to stories of negativity from her week - or have stories of my week twisted into the same.\n\nI would take a step back and allow the guys to continue hanging out just the two of them, however my partner is not happy with this as he knows I would be missing doing and going to things I enjoy.  My concern is that taking a step back would cause my partner to fall out of touch with his friend.\n\nI am not sure how to handle this situation.  Any advice on how to reduce my time spent with her without destroying our friendship with him would be much appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I also worked at a PC building store last year so if you need advice on parts or anything, I'm your girl. I've also played in some semipro/collegiate leagues before and attended some LANs. Some games I like to play at the moment are R6 Siege, LoL, Overwatch, and a bunch others. I also play Splatoon and Smash on Switch.\n* I also love cars.

I'm 100% always down to engage in banter about how Japanese engineering will always be superior. ;) I hope someday to open up a tuning/dyno shop. \n* In terms of movies, I love a good action/revenge flick, or anything really stylized. My favourite movies have to be John Wick, Django Unchained, Chungking Express, and The Grand Budapest Hotel. Anime is cool too, but haven't been keeping up with anything this season. \n* I'm an engineering student.

Anyways, we were hanging out lately and I think I took to close what they said to me when I was asked to keep her in check (along the lines don't let lead him on) while she was with a guy hanging out with us. She didn't do anything to make it seem like the affections we're unwanted, I was getting annoyed she wouldn't stop when I was making it obvious she was absolutely doing something to make it seem like more. They were on the ground cuddling later on, and I'm just at the end, more annoyed than the whole night because I think she's just leading this guy on when she said that wasn't the intention she wanted. (Next day learned some time in that night they decided to just be cuddle buddies) She sees my look and says 'Don't act like you and I never do this kind of stuff.' and now, these last couple days I can't stop thinking about this. I'm over thinking it to a point that I don't know if I should feel like I'm just an emotional fill in until someone else comes along, feeling used by my best friend in some instances and I just don't know if it's worth explaining that. And today I'm thinking that it's all just me overreacting and just being a shit friend for thinking this. I don't know how to talk to her and I don't know if this is selfish. Maybe I'm the shitty friend, maybe I needed to just let go and let her do whatever. I just got too invested in trying to keep them in line. I have no clue at this point.

Let\u2019s call her \u201cSam.\u201d So Sam has been a friend of mine since 5th grade. She moved to Arkansas a couple of years ago, and I believe I\u2019ve seen her once since then because she came to see me when she was in town. (She can\u2019t visit much since I know she\u2019s busy.) Well she was in town this week and I mentioned us hanging out, but all I got was an excuse. I then texted her again mentioning hanging out and she ignored that text. Now I believe she is back in Arkansas. She was hanging out with other friends, posting pictures of her with them etc. I have helped her through so much. Breakups, her talking suicidal, congratulating her for getting a job, you name it. My husband has helped her as well. I thought she would go crazy to see me. She always acts that way and says she wants me to visit her and everything, which I can\u2019t just yet because of work even though I would love to. I love her to death and was excited when I figured out she was in town (I only found out through Facebook. She didn\u2019t tell me directly.) I just don\u2019t understand why she acts like she cares and wants to see me, but then when she is in town, she doesn\u2019t seem to care. She also posted on Facebook a picture saying \u201cPay attention to who\u2019s happy for you when you\u2019re happy\u201d, which was last night ( after the text she ignored was sent.)

I\u2019m in my 30s and live in South Florida. Physically I\u2019m on the shorter side however I\u2019m not overweight, keep myself in shape and go to the gym 3-4 times a week. I\u2019m an extremely shy person that has a bit of a nerdy side to him. \n\nMy hobbies include the following:\nVideo Games: Mostly blizzard games like WoW, Overwatch and Hearthstone but I\u2019m also into Final Fantasy, Uncharted and really looking forward to The Last of Us 2 (the 1st probably being my favorite game of all time)\n\nCosplay: I can\u2019t say I\u2019m a fanatic but I do enjoy seeing other cosplays. The dedication and the art of making a costume is pretty fascinating to me. I did create my 1st cosplay last year and received many compliments and was asked for a picture about every 30 seconds at a recent con. Currently working on another and I believe this one will come out even better. \n\nTraveling: I love traveling. Can\u2019t get enough of it and would love to explore the world. A few places I\u2019ve been to: China, Taiwan Singapore. I am actually dying to go to Japan and would like to visit Europe one day as well.\n\nOther sources of entertainment: Obviously love watching movies, GoT, football and basketball music and going to concerts.\n\nAnyways, I think that\u2019s enough for now.

(Aliens welcome!)", "author": "susliklev", "self_text": "Can someone please tell me where in the bloody hells my three weeks of holidays went? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoy the program that I am in.. but I DuN WanNa REtUrN tO CoLLegE ON mONdAy AaAAaAaaaA\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info about me, as I still am trying to learn the art of being concise:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian fluently.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate.\n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned career, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, which I am dealing with as best as I can - although recently, things have been on the mend - enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n- Living with my parents for financial convenience - yay! :D\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am somewhat stigmatized against the latter by a some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not in fact a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandize and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed. \n\n- Gainfully *un*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work.\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Auromata, WoW, DOOM, Bioshock, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. Honestly, for whataver reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\nI have not really been playing anything seriously for a bit now, so looking for new games to sink my teeth in.\n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favorite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favorite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loath cheap jumpscares they are so enamored with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n- My sense of humor is possibly the worst, and I have dank memes ready for every possible situation and I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile humor. \n\n- Super into airsoft at the moment - spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together, but at least I seem to finally getting into the swing of things: went to play last Saturday, and not only did I get my first non-melee kill, but I got to use my new sidearm! I also broke a buddy\u2019s handguard and some dick shot my flashlight\u2019s lens out. I also got a cold from laying on the floor too much.\nAll in all, let\u2019s call it a sucess! :D\n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I think it is time to give up trying to categorize what I like by genre, and instead do it by what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord) I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n[Here is *my* Christmas carol for 2018.](\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TBpNtmanZ1Y)\n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%! \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. That goes for stuff like lack of grammar and improper punctuation to short and generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit.\n\nI prefer using Discord over anything else, but I like to get to know people on here before jumping in there. Please no Reddit Chats, I hate the UI. \n\nFeel free to hit me with your favorite ice breaker! (As long as it is not a Trotsky ice pick). \n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Similar interests and what not. This kid has always been sort of an underdog, never really the loudest or most popular, athletic, etc... Just recently we became very close friends and got along really well. Over college break this kid has really been getting on my nerves, bullying me and trying to get a reaction, like a younger brother saying the most embarrassing things in front of girls to make you look weird. There are about 10 of us close friends as a collective, and each time we all get together he keeps on badgering me until I say something. I do my best to avoid what he says, however, can't always keep my cool. I'll be talking to a friend, this kid overhears, and will bring up something of my past to piss me off.\n\nI know he's insecure and very controlling. He wants everybody to be in his command and I don't buy it. I can see right through him, and he knows it. He's always biting my style, my music, and even the places I eat at. It's cool and all, but he doesn't have to be such a twat to me. For example; I'll be talking aloud and he'll say something along the lines of: \"That's not what your fat whore of a mother said last night\". Others don't think it's funny, but he often gets a reaction. It may be because he's jealous or envious of me? He usually makes up stories and fibs about a lot of things. He likes to add himself into stories that either never happened or that someone else did, even using my stories as an example with him instead.\n\nI need some help on how to deal with this kid before things get out of hand.

The move has been pretty hard on me since none of my friends/family live in the area and I'm too busy to go out much. \n\nAbout me: I'm a bit of a hippie granola type. I just recently decided to transition from vegetarian to vegan. I enjoy going to festivals, hiking, and some artsy stuff even though I'm not especially talented. All through college I lived in a weird, vegan \"intentional community\" where I met my current partner.  I guess you could say we sold out, but we think we're still punk.

I'm now 38 he is 36. We were both single males with mediocre jobs, and we decided to reduce costs by living as roommates in 2 bedroom apartment.\n\nWe did it for 18 month in another place without hiccups. We then split for 2 years, and this summer we decided to move in together again. We functioned well again until 20 days ago when he found a new girlfriend.\n\nWe had an agreement before that if a girl happens to any of us and we decided to live with her other guy would go and make room for them - no hard feelings. We are at the age where we are looking for long lasting meaningful relationship.\n\nBut this girl came in a period of his life where his money is so scarce he can't afford to pay the rent on his own. She is still basically a student and has no significant income. Last 20 days she left our crib just once for 2 nights.\n\nHe asked me on her 3rd day if it would be OK for me that she sleeps over for a few nights in a row to study for her exams cos she has moody roommates in her college campus. And I decisively said NO. I think she can come over once a week maybe sometimes twice, and that he has every right to have a girlfriend but if he intends to live with her I will just go. I said clearly that I don't feel comfortable, that I feel like I have a guest at my place all the time.\n\nAfter that she went away for 2 nights and when she came back he pleaded with me to let her stay until Christmas (another 10 days), than she would go to stay with her family for 2 month and they won't be able to see each other. He said, please endure it for your bro.\n\nNow Christmas is over and new years eve is approaching and she is still here. She couldn't go home supposedly cos of some snow storms.\n\nI can't make them leave. If I tell her that it was enough and that she should leave he will get angry and feel hurt. I can't tell them both to search for a place for themselves cos they simply can't afford it. And it is hard for me to confront him with everything cos in the end it will come down to that that I have more money and I am trying to decide for us all.\n\nI could pay for this place alone, but searching for a new place, paying for moving service and paying for a new place deposit is too much for me at this moment. So I'm stuck at least for 2-3 month.\n\nI just don't know how to make them stop it. I feel like I need to face them with reality, they are in love but if they can't afford to find their own place they should work on it and leave me the space I need. They just took it too fast. One night it was one-night stand second night was undefined, 3rd night he cleared a part of his closet for her things and I saw her toothbrush next to his. And I would be fine with it if I wasn't ALSO LIVING THERE.\n\nThey are kind of quiet and decent but I just don't feel comfortable. I also don't want to ask her to pay one third of the rent cos that is just not a solution, I don't need the money, she probably can't afford it, and I wouldn't feel any more comfortable around the house.\n\nWhat should I do? I am at the breaking point where I even wouldn't mind ending my friendship with him I just want them gone.

About a year ago she started talking to this girl [X] online who is about 21. We are still in high-school and X has her own apartment, is in university, and is generally just way more mature and further along in life than us. This paired with the fact that X is strangely immature and childish was already concerning to me and many of my friends. Over the summer they met up, my friend met X\u2019s friends and hung out at her apartment, and quickly it was \u201cofficial\u201d that they were going out. At this point i was a bit uncomfortable especially because of X\u2019s age, but my friend seemed happy so I didn\u2019t push it too much. \nFast forward like a month?? they break up. My friend says they just weren\u2019t working out and it was pretty mutual. X (being an immature pos) proceeds to berate my friend on twitter, block her, subtweet her several times, and just generally react to what my friend deemed to be mutual and not too messy in a truly vile way. My friend is an extremely caring and sensitive person and took all of this very hard, like it was so hard to watch. Deep down I was glad that she had been able to see what a bad person X was, and that she had not been hurt too seriously. \n\nLiterally a week ago my friend starts hinting that she and X are \u201cstill in love\u201d etc. and I find out from another of my best friends that they resumed talking about two weeks after the breakup. In my eyes X is an emotionally abusive, toxic person. I\u2019m really worried because her coming back into my friends life in such a way has happened at the same time as some drastic changes in my friend\u2019s university choices. I\u2019m scared she\u2019s basing her future on a relationship with X. \n\nSeveral of my friends agree with me and have tried to communicate their concerns but my friend refuses to take it seriously. \n\nBasically I need help because I want to tell her how concerned I am but I\u2019m worried if i force it too much or say the wrong thing she\u2019ll cut off from me. \n\nTL;DR: friend in a toxic relationship, don\u2019t know how to tell her I\u2019m worried without sounding like a bad person/having her cut me off\n", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I feel like I'm being ignored but don't know why / where to go from here. \n\nI'll try to keep it short. My best friend and I are damn near 30. We've been friends since junior high. Of course people become adults and live their lives, but I can't help but feel like I'm losing everything and our relationship is suffering.\n\nMaybe the first strike was my best friend getting into a serious relationship and therefore most of her time is with him etc. Meanwhile I'm living my loveless life so I felt like I couldn't vent to her about guys since she wasn't living that single life anymore. It also didn't help that I've been living abroad and have yet to meet this guy in person but after video chat he's finally growing on me and I'm happy for them. \n\nFor the greater part of our 20s we've been living pretty far apart due to study /career. We now live countries apart and with that comes time differences so it's hard to have calls etc. So with that... social media is the best way for us to communicate while living our very different and separate lives. However I've noticed that my best friend rarely comments, likes, or interacts to things I share. But I always notice that she interacts with things her family post and uploads photos or statuses when her and her bf go out or something. So I know she's  active enough on social media. \n\nI just feel left out. it also doesn't help that when we do talk her bf is RIGHT THERE. I always find myself censoring what I say because I know he's there. Anyway, I just keep trying to think of why I'm feeling/being treated like less and less of a best friend. I really want to say something but I feel stupid complaining about social media attention when it's way deeper than that. When we meet it's like nothing changed. I just want my friend to talk/interact with me :( \n\n...so much for trying to keep it short ", "subreddit": "friendship"}

{"post_id": "ad703x", "created_utc": 1546792106, "title": "A friend has a controlling partner!", "author": "pamelodaisuki", "self_text": "Hi,\n\nMy first ever post on Reddit.\n\nI met my good friend during uni last week and be told me he's getting married this weekend! He's already married  by now! The reason he's doing it now is his girlfriend's visa to be in the UK is expiring end of this month. What a reason to get married. \nAccording to him, they made this decision between them. If her visa expires in the UK, she will go back to her home country and she said she won't do long distance. So sounds like breaking up or getting married scenario. Ok, so I respect this. But this is just the beginning of the story I gathered.\nSome background: My friend and I stopped hanging out since he met his girlfriend only 10 months ago. He also cancelled on me when we planned to go away one bank holiday along with my boyfriend ( he is friend with too) because he would rather spend time with his girlfriend ( not girlfriend back then).\n\nSo we (he, myself, another good friend, my boyfriend) went to lunch last week ( the day he told me the news). His girlfriend called him 3 times within 15 mins window!!- not sure what he said but mainly about when he's going back? \nI thought that was a little bit controlling, but this is just the beginning.\nDuring lunch, we talked about his friend and we said she is very pretty. My boyfriend went to my friend's Instagram and saw a photo just been posted. A lovely photo where my friend lifting his girlfriend. But my friend was having lunch with us and did not post it??! It turns out his girlfriend has access to his Instagram account and posting. His profile has been changed to - love always and tagged herself. I thought that's bad.\nThen we talked about when he told his family about it. He said he went to his cousin's wedding and wanted to tell his parents after the wedding. He went alone. At the beginning of the wedding, his dad saw an email inviting him to go to marriage registry send by my friend while them sitting next to each other. His dad asked my friend if this is true that he is getting married the week after? He said it is true but obviously that's not how he wanted to do it. So it turns out, his girlfriend actually sent the email using my friend's email! So she has access to his email account too. I thought that's not nice- at least she could have checked with him before sending the email. \nOk, so my impression for my friend's girlfriend is getting worse. She calls him frequently when he's out with his friends, she controls his social media and also email account...  I thought that's bad enough.\n\nLater that day, I noticed that he left the what's app group between him and another good friend. And when I sent a message, it was not sent. So we knew I was blocked on what's app. We've known each other since uni and we both were not happy about it. So my friend and I called him asking what's going on. He said he didn't do it and it's technical problem- what's app makes you leave groups. I've never heard that before. He said she didn't tell him that she's done it but he admitted that she has access to his mobile phone too!!! I was not happy- fair enough that he doesn't mind her controlling him but he shouldn't let her get in the way of our friendship?! \n\nThe following day- when I was talking to my boyfriend and I wanted to show him the photo of them together. I went to my Instagram account but unable to find my friend?! I'm blocked by my friend when I didn't do anything wrong? My boyfriend is still friend with him on Instagram it seems. My the other female friend at the lunch has been blocked too. I was very angry and upset. My friend and I already expressed that we think his girlfriend is controlling and he needs to be careful. He said he knows what he's doing and he refuses to listen. Now he's already married and I'm still shocked. \n\nI would like some advice please. What should I do? Should I give up on our friendship as clearly he doesn't care about me and my friend by allowing his now wife to interfere with our friendship e.g blocking us on social media\nMaybe this is part of life. When people get into relationship, marriage, they have other higher priorities than you and I need to accept it? My friend is very nice and has very high tolerance... Just sad to see my friend being controlled. At the end of the day, it's his life but I can't help but feel sad as it might be the end of our friendship. \n\nThank you in advance! \n", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I've been this way my whole life and it's made socializing a chore. It also doesn't help that I'm not particularly interesting(insert shrugging meme here) Despite my worries and mundaneness I really do want to practice socializing and making friends. Loneliness sucks and it can kill.\n\nWell... I guess this is where I describe myself. \n\n\u2022I'm a 24-year-old male\n\u2022I'm laid back yet awkward\n\u2022I work with shoes and these ravenous creatures called customers.

Smash is currently my obsession. Persona and Pokemon are my favorite gaming series\n\n\u2022I like anime(I'm weeb trash). I'm not caught up on current anime, unfortunately, but feel free to recommend shows to me. My top favorite series are FMA, Gurren Logan, Little Witch Academia, and Haruhi Suzumiya.\n\n\u2022I like to collect figures related to video games, anime and other media, take photos of them and post them to the internet because I'm a big man-child.\n\n\u2022Speaking of a man-child, I love animation. From 90's cartoons to new school cartoons, \n\n\u2022I tend to have a dark/self-deprecating sense of humor.\n\nWell... that's all I have to share.\n\nTo break the ice between us, I've listed some questions to get the conversation ball rolling. You don't have to answer all of these. Hell, you don't have to answer any of these, these are just icebreaker question. It's up to you...\n\n\u2022What are the 5 places you would like to visit\n\u2022What is one of your favorite games/shows/movies and why?\n\n\u2022If you could have any animal as a pet, what would it be and why?\n\n\u2022What is your dream job\n\n\u2022Tell me the lamest pun you know and/or the darkest joke you know.\n\n\u2022What are your top 3 favorite music genres?\n\u2022Who are your favorite waifus and/or husbando? Or who is your favorite character(s) from anime\n\nWell, that's that, I hope I didn't come off as too weird. I hope this all works all out. You don't have to be socially awkward as me to with me, if you're a social pro(or whatever) and still want to talk, please feel free to message me. You can talk with me here on Reddit or on Telegram and Kik. Also, when it comes to responding I tend to be slow to get to my messages since I have other things going on during the day.

Sorry, but it might be a long one...\n\nRecently I saw on social media that my friend group was hanging out - without me.\n\nAnd trust me, before I start to sound like some sort of self-centered bitch, I know that I obviously don't have to be included in everything or anything at all. It is 100% fine for people to not invite me to things because at the end of the day - it's their choice - and I respect that.\n\nThe only thing was that this time, it was essentially my three closest friends who I've been with for years now. I mean that we're close to the point where I can't even describe what it's like when we're all together. We all seem to understand each other beyond understanding ourselves and our personalities have noticeably blended together. So naturally, it hurt when I saw them all hanging out together without me. It isn't even that I was invited and couldn't make it but that I wasn't invited in the first place. I think it hurts more every time it happens; this isn't the first time. I actually notice that it happens more and more now where I'm often excluded from plans. It would make sense if it were two people out of the group. That's completely understandable and obviously completely fine. In terms of grouping, it's honestly more likely to see us hanging out in pairs instead of our whole group because it can sometimes be hard to coordinate.\n\nI feel like my entire life I've always been the bitch who gets forgotten. I know that I'm not the only person in the world to feel this way but its so hard not to be hurt by this. My entire life revolves around my friends because I've never had the best home life. Honestly, I think that I put too much emphasis on friendship in my life - but I can't not. My friends mean the world to me. Especially my close friends. It hurts to see that they've started to make so many plans without me. I'm not the confrontational type either so I'll never say anything to anyone about this. I think I'd end up getting too emotional and I don't want to be a nuisance to anyone either.\n\nOne of the worst things in the world is hearing \"Oh, sorry, I/we didn't invite you because you're always busy.\" Fine. It's true. I can't make it to plans as often as other people. I'm busy. But honestly, that is one of the most painful things to hear. It's probably just an excuse for having forgotten me. And if it is actually your reasoning, I really just would've liked the option to see my friends. Because maybe, just maybe for once, I'm not busy. Maybe I could've even cleared out my plans to hang out.\n\nDon't get me wrong, friendship goes both ways. I understand that I'm also responsible for inviting people to hang out. I do. Or, I did. I used to always invite people to hang out with me whenever I had time but once I realized that I often wasn't getting the same invitations I started to stop. My entire life I've always been to one to make plans with people. I'm rarely on the other end. I try to avoid shallow friendships because I know that other people don't ever care as much about me. I also know that friendships don't last forever and I'll constantly be meeting new people which I love to do. Meeting someone new is always such a highlight to any day.\n\nNow, as high school is ending, I'm leaving for a college in another state about 1,000 miles away. At the end of the day, I know that they all care about me as much as I care about them (at least I hope). I'm sure that we're all going to be just as close in the future (maybe with a physical distance as we branch out to do different things). I want to stay just as close with them. But sometimes, I just wish that I didn't have to be forgotten.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: this isn't exactly a complaint about my friends because I love them all more than the world but its just some emotions that were recently resurfaced.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Young 20s male, never had a girlfriend, don't have any ***real*** friends.\n\nMy last birthday was a bust because I basically have no friends. I could see the look of worry, sympathy and some anger in my parents and siblings' eyes because I was home all day, and it ate me up, like it physically hurt. Now ever since New Years, I have been having (*thankfully*) short panic attacks, because I've basically given up all hope of every being \"socially successful\". I even know the source of my SA, it is my looks, which are basically terrible. (*I am objectively ugly and trying to come to terms with it, I say this very politely: Please don't tell me I prolly look good, I know I don't. I hope this last sentence didn't sound rude, I didn't mean it to!*).                                                                                                                                                                  I've even tried to follow the general reddit guide of working out + dressing better + better hygiene + a nice (not NiceGuy) demeanour, but every where I go with my family, its always my siblings who will get the \"Wow you're attractive\" looks, and people make it seem like talking to me is a chore rather than something they'd want to do.\n\nMy looks (*which cannot really be fixed w/o opting for surgery, btw*) give me major stress all the time. To the extent that at one point I even decided never to have kids so I don't pass down my messed up genetics. So every time I see a happy family, I tear up knowing I will never have what they have, all because of my looks. I can't stress enough how much this breaks me on the inside.\n\nOn a recent family camping trip, the toxic cocktail of emotions I have described above caused me and my siblings to get into a (*physical*) fight, because they blamed me for \"ruining\" their holiday by being \"moody\" and \"a loner\" all the time. I swear to god, my family is the best goddamn family anyone can ever have, they just don't know what goes on though my head all the time. When the fight happened, it felt like it was my entire family against me. The fight itself is **so** unlike me.\n\nIf you knew how unlike me this next statement will sound, you'd probably be really blown away. But it is true that I keep thinking that if my life continues the way its going on right now, I'll probably be at the point of suicide sooner rather than later. I'm not a suicide risk, I **will not do it, ever**, but even the fact that this thought crosses **my** mind every now and then just makes me feel worse. I used to be such a happy go lucky guy who everyone loved having around, man.\n\nThe concept of mental health is pretty backward where I'm from, and I don't have access to a good quality professional to seek help. I can feel how close I am to just breaking down, whatever the heck that means. I've tried posting on reddit before, it has never helped me despite some ridiculously kind hearted redditors speaking to me, so I don't know what the heck I'm even doing here; I guess the name of this sub just made me overly emotional.

During the last years we occasionally met once a month for some hours. Nothing special but always nice. Beginning last year my wife ended our relationship and I got pretty depressed. He took care of me and allowed me to live with him. He also had some relationship issues and needed some money so it was a good trade for both of us. On the other side it was pretty clear that I won't stay too long. After half a year I had enough energy and money to move on. I moved to another city 100km away and got a new girlfriend. This was around 3 months ago. The first 2 months I visited him 3 out of 4 weekends.\n\nWith a full-time job, spending this much time away from home will result in achieving nothing. I barely can relax, don't see my girlfriend and cannot do basic stuff like buying food or clean my room. Furthermore I often like to be alone to calm down and rest my mind.\n\nUnfortunately his wife also broke up with him a few weeks ago. Despite really being stressed I cancelled all my appointments at the weekend and again spent the whole weekend with him. But I felt that I am not able to do this any further.\n\nSo I decided for myself to just visit him for 1 day and not both weekend days the next times. Last week he asked me if I will come to him over the weekend. I told him Sunday is possible but not Saturday. On Saturday I had an appointment regarding an injury (nothing serious but still needed to be done). I think now we come to the core of the problem. He has issues accepting a \"no\". It's like in every possible scenario he wants to force his will on others. It's a real fight. I told him several times it's not possible but he insisted and really started begging. He also suggested driving to my place and spending the day with me there. Including the appointment and then driving to his place together (keep in mind I pay around 30$ one way for train). In the end I \"won\". But I had the feeling he doesn't like that. Guess what? One day later he told me I can stay at home and chill. He is fine and doesn't need any help now. I already guessed where this is going. Now today he wrote again if I want to visit him this weekend. He didn't specify but we can safely assume that he means the whole weekend. \n\nHow can I deal with that without being too rude? Or am I wrong here?\n\nEdit: sorry if I am not clear.

Also being a degenerate isn\u2019t an insult\u2026*not in this context anyway*\u2026\n\nSo apparently I\u2019m actually supposed to tell you a little bit about myself, which is quite a challenge seeing as I\u2019m weird and not particularly interesting, but ya know, no harm in trying. \n\nSo uhm, lemme just start with the downsides of knowing me. Because ya know downsides are the best part of everything.

I'll spoil one pro though. i'm definitely kind of funny...sometimes...maybe......okay maybe not that funny......okay i'm not funny BUT I TRY......\n\nAnyway my hobbies include but are not limited to, sarcasm, sarcasm, MORE SARCASM, watching shitty youtube videos, playing videogames drawing, learning spanish.

Since the age of birth, I've found difficulty in social situations. Even on my anti-depressants, I become overly anxious around new and different people, which can lead to extreme bursts that embarrass me and my peers or shyness confused for rejection. I know how to be friendly, and a good friend to someone when they need me, but I have zero knowledge of how to keep friends or if I even want them (I'm sorry if that sounds edgy). For example, I am always there for people when they need advice, help, someone to talk to, etc., but when I am in need they are less likely to be seen. It's likely due to my habit of talking to no one most of my day and night aside from my boyfriend, who is usually too busy to talk anyway.\n\nHere's a little background info of myself; I'm female, nineteen, have a terrible relationship with my parents (family too but that's another story) due to emotional neglect, and full of emotional baggage. I have depression and anxiety disorders, and likely an attention-related disorder that hasn't been diagnosed. I've never been good in relationships, friendly and romantic, yet I crave them constantly. I have way too many needs, I'm insanely annoying, I'm distant until I'm not and when I'm not I need MASSIVE amounts of attention, etc. I also have the issue of wanting to be alone until I'm lonely, if that makes sense. In short; I'm not really desirable. My interests include anime, video games, streamers, and music; if interested I'll list my favorites (I'm so indecisive I can never choose just one). Recently I have started Zombie Land Saga, Mother 3 (no spoilers please!), watched excessive amounts of Jerma985 and Vinesauce, and listened to some video game soundtracks, as some examples.\n\nI've recently been attending university, and, with it, comes new peers. Though I am undecided in my major, I've considered business or communications related studies; those that obviously require, well, speaking and friendship. Most of my time with other students I am not very familiar with comes from the rec room, where I play video games with randos and a few regulars.\n\nI apologize for my train of thought in this, but again, I have issues paying attention and can't focus very well on a thought, action, or process most of the time.\n\n**Here are my issues with making friends: I am distant and needy. I am extremely introverted, yet require all of the attention in the world (obviously exaggerated). I am insecure of my interests, hobbies, and appearance. I never approach first. I don't know how to keep up a conversation. I find people hard to trust due to previous abusive relationships. I fear abandonment, which leads to excessive clinginess and/or pushing others away. My schedule is sporadic. I fear talking to more than one person because of how controlling my exes were and parents can be.**\n\n**TL;DR - I can't handle myself, social situations, or other people because of my environmental and mental state. Advice?**\n\nAnd again, I apologize for the incoherent and sporadic thought process; I'll gladly clarify anything and add additional information as requested. Thank you in advance!\n\nEdit: it took me a bit to make this lol, and I just realized how late it is my time (past ten, I usually stay up later but I have to wake up early); so, I'll be responding to everything in the morning as it'll make my whole day, tbh.

Yay.  \nIn any case, here is some basic info about me, as I still am trying to learn the art of being concise:  \n\\- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian fluently.  \n\\- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate.  \n\\- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned career, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics.  \n\\- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, which I am dealing with as best as I can - although recently, things have been on the mend - enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom.\u00a0  \n\\- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too.\u00a0  \n\\- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is \\*very\\* important to me :\\^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.  \n\\- Living with my parents for financial convenience - yay! :D  \n\\- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am somewhat stigmatized against the latter by a some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not in fact a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandize and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed.\u00a0  \n\\- Gainfully \\*un\\*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work.  \nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:  \n\\- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Auromata, WoW, DOOM, Bioshock, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. Honestly, for whataver reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)  \nFinally got around to playing the original Nier, which I had to order off of Ebay. So, so worth it! :D  \n\\- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favorite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show.\u00a0  \n\\- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.  \n\\- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favorite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic.\u00a0  \n\\- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loath cheap jumpscares they are so enamored with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best.\u00a0  \n\\- My sense of humor is possibly the worst, and I have dank memes ready for every possible situation and I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile humor.\u00a0  \n\\- Super into airsoft at the moment - spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together, but at least I seem to finally getting into the swing of things: went to play last Saturday, and not only did I get my first non-melee kill, but I got to use my new sidearm! I also broke a buddy\u2019s handguard and some dick shot my flashlight\u2019s lens out. I also got a cold from laying on the floor too much.  \nAll in all, let\u2019s call it a sucess! :D  \n\\- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I think it is time to give up trying to categorize what I like by genre, and instead do it by what I \\*don\u2019t\\* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord) I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade!\u00a0  \n\\[Here is \\*my\\* Christmas carol for 2018.\\]([https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TBpNtmanZ1Y](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TBpNtmanZ1Y))  \n\\- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.  \n\\- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics.\u00a0  \n\\- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%!\u00a0  \nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: \\*\\*if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying.

At most the chat lasts for a week before it gets silent.\n\nA little bit about me. I am 19M, soon to be 20. I have had social anxiety since I was a teenager, could be because I spent most of my time behind a computer screen rather than socializing. I am currently doing computer science in universtity. I am INTP if you are into that kind of thing. I'll tell you my name once we get to know each other better. \n\n I have had many friends in school, college and now uni, but I never seem to be able to keep in contact with them. I have 2 close friends for over 7 years now, one I met in school, the other one, I've never met but we have been pretty much texting daily for 6 years now. Over the years, I have been contact with people around the world, as a freelancer at times, as an employer at times, or sometimes for a team of developers to either participate in a competition or just make something for fun.\n\nI'm from an Asian country so if you are the kind of person that is racist, please refrain from contacting me. Timezones don't matter to me as I have a weird sleep schedule. One of my close friend is from UK, and keeping contact with him has been easy for me. I have had people that I work with from around the world as well, US, UK. Australia, Costa Rica, India, Russia and so on. \n\nNow for my interests:\n- wanna be Game Developmer and a Programmer for about 7 years now.\n- I love driving with music (and night drives are freaking amazing)\n- I like to create stuff, real life or virtually but its just something I love.\n- sometimes I take good photos of nature, buildings and etc.\n- Gaming - not a hardcore gamer, but if I start playing a game, there is no stopping until I finish it. \n- Used to watch alot of TV shows - Mr Robot, GoT, Sherlock\n- I am a very good procrastinator, I do work to avoid work. \n\nAnd one of my worst interest is to think, a never ending thought for questions that have no definitive answers. Thanks to that I have been depressed, suicidal and all that, but don't stop reading yet. I'm better now, nowadays I don't give enough f**k to care about that, just going with the flow of life working for what I want. Let's just say ignorance was bliss and I realized it too late. \n\nI am also not a normal person, I've never went to a party or club, got drunk or smoked or get high. Only go out with my one friend to movies or coffees to discuss life and work. I've made good choices, bad choices and worst choices in my life. \n\nSo now for the people that I don't want to talk to:\n- racist / bigot like I mentioned earlier\n- if you are too religious, I might offend you and I wouldn't have a clue when I do.\n- creeps\n- and definitely not somebody who doesn't wanna try to keep the conversation going for a while.\n\nEverybody else, please PM me with an intro of yourself. I don't care about your gender or age, though I prefer you are not too young, maybe 16 and above is fine. Even if your interests are different from mine, not you are still working towards a goal or something, message me.\n\nI am on many different messaging apps, so we can chat there as well.\n\nSorry for the long post, and I tried to be as specific as I can cause I am just looking for a new friend.

Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of option, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person.\n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers).\n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values).\n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

I was supposedly in my 4th year in university but had to stop since living comfortably day-to-day is already a challenge in itself... not that I have any idea what to do with my life in the first place.\n\nI entered 2019 feeling anxious and melancholic about the future. I have gene tests coming up and thinking about their would be results and implications scare me. I have nightmares contstantly reminding me of my fears... and sometimes when I see some nice scenerey, I get this sinking feeling/ intuition that I won't be surprised if my life would be short.

{"post_id": "ae8ivt", "created_utc": 1547051689, "title": "my friends can't stop discussing their sex lives explicitly both in casual and drunk conversations", "author": "chillilay", "self_text": "So, to give a little background....All my friends are within the 20-21 range. We are pretty close as we've gone through high school, college and currently -university- together. I've always been the single one of the group and up until University, all of them were just as sexually inexperienced as I am. Now two of them have gotten a taste of what sex feels like and at first, it didn't really bother me. \n\nI mean, we're growing up or whatever and although I choose to not be as liberal as they are, I respect their decisions. I wouldn't say I'm sex repulsed either but I do feel as if sometimes when I give my two cents, I'm often dismissed. Like once a friend asked me how I'd feel about a threesome and a friend from this same friend group immediately shut down my opinion before I could have even answered. Her logic was \"how could you even know? You've never had sex yet\".  Not only is this extremely presumptious of her, it is also very hypocritical because I bet if she was still a virgin and the same question was asked, she'd have an opinion of her own. I don't know, that comment she made really got to me. And I don't get how anyone could feel comfortable with shutting down someone's opinion like that. \n\n\nAnyway, at first, when these two friends would talk to me about their sexual adventures, I wouldn't mind. But after a while, as they began to get more detailed, I'd always express how I really didn't care to know so much. It's not like I would tolerate it. I'd make remarks, roll my eyes; do anything but somehow this would egg them on even more to continue and laugh at my discomfort. I'd even ask them questions because part of me felt like I needed to include myself in the convo to seem interested, and the other part wanted to be considerate enough to be part of a conversation although I don't have any experience. Like more of a supportive kinda role because I hate people who shut down completely when they're unfamiliar with a topic. \n\n\nI'd even dread being around these friends during my breaks from classes because during times where I could have been studying, I'd be listening to them complaining about missing sex.  It would even get worst when they were drunk. They'd sit and whine all the time and even recycle stories they've told on countless other occasions. They'd even discuss the dick size and appearance of the guys who they were involved with around me. Like who does that? Hanging out just doesn't seem as full-filling anymore and I know for a fact it's not because of hidden jealousy and lack of experience because I genuinely have tried to accommodate these types of conversations. At the end of the day, I know at some point in time I would probably have sex and although I'm not having it now does not mean I have to close off any conversation regarding it. \n\n\nIt's just not as inviting to hang out at seemingly interesting places anymore because I know for a fact that the explicitly detailed sex talk would come up. I'm just tired you guys. I also don't want to be that person to police people into what conversations they should  have around me. I  feel like  I bring it up, they'd  try so hardly to tone it down and fail anyway because it is literally embedded in them to brag about it. Have any of you experienced this? Share your experience below and maybe we could bond so I can finally avoid growing insane. ", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019m a gal and he\u2019s a guy, completely platonic. I\u2019ve always known he had some anger issues, but I figured I am a very laid back person and living with him would be no problem. That didn\u2019t last long. Long story short we have very different ways of living. We started out buying groceries together and that blew up when he refused to buy from cheaper stores/get off brand items and was upset that I in return wanted to buy my groceries separately. He\u2019s very over emotional, constantly mad and upset about something, I swear to god every night is a crisis. He constantly talks nonstop, about things I frankly am not really interested in, and I am more introverted, so I get annoyed when I have to hold up a conversation all day long. When I\u2019m in my room he won\u2019t hesitate to ask me any little thing that comes to his mind through my door which often leads to him coming in and piping up another conversation. He\u2019s very bossy/passive aggressive towards me but doesn\u2019t hold up his own expectations. We got into a full blown argument once when he was mad that I had left a wrapper out or something, came to my bathroom door while I was using it and started bitching, when I got out of the bathroom I walked out and pointed out all of his trash, we both got defensive, and he did apologize. But the apology was sort of a \u201cfeel bad for me\u201d apology. \u201cI\u2019m such a fucking asshole, I hate myself so much, you probably hate me now\u201d.  This eventually blew over, but he\u2019s always freaking out on me worrying about my rent being late, because honestly I do wait until the last minute to send things in, I\u2019m EXTREMELY busy (music degree) but I have NEVER been late on my rent. Always saying \u201cI\u2019m not paying a late fee\u201d yeah, I know you\u2019re not, even if it were to happen, it\u2019s my rent. He is constantly talking shit about people for very petty reasons. People who I consider friends. I have friends who I won\u2019t bring over because he hates them for no reason other than he deems them \u201cannoying\u201d. If you do something slightly wrong, that he doesn\u2019t like, he will seriously hate you forever and get seriously hostile  and angry anything that persons name brought up. Won\u2019t even try to talk that person about whatever petty thing upset him. He gets very mad and has meltdowns over inconveniences like homework, or little things not working (once our doorknob broke and it was literally ww3) At the end of the day, Me and him have been through a lot together, and knowing him he would hate me forever and talk non stop shit if I told him I didn\u2019t want to room. I can\u2019t be honest because he never takes responsibility, he just gets mad and offended. Should I just endure him to preserve our friendship?\n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t like living with my roommate but we have had a long friendship and don\u2019t know how to tell him without upsetting him.

In the beginning, everything seemed cool. She had financial and family struggles and was kind of lonely. So I kind of felt bad for her. I tried to make her feel happy like give her advice and took her places. I helped her in a lot of things throughout the year, I genuinely cared. \n\nAbout a month into the friendship,she called me best friend which I thought was a little weird. Anyways, I started to question our friendship when she started to act pushy and bossy towards me. She started to ask me for crazy favors.  I was like oh ok sure no big deal I have no problem with helping, but then she started asking stupid favors frequently. These favors were things that she was perfectly capable of doing herself. Few examples...she would ask me to go bring her wallet from her locker at work or check something on her phone for her or count how many months is between July and January (wtf). I was thinking is she either too tired or lazy to do things herself? I eventually told her how I felt about this. I told her I felt like a servant and she said I\u2019m sorry if you feel this way. (I don\u2019t know if she completely understood me because she still asks and tries to ask). When I told her how I felt completely, she was like I\u2019m not using you, please don\u2019t think I\u2019m using you. I won\u2019t ask you to do things for me anymore (that was a lie).\n\nI became a little bit more assertive to her like telling her no. However, sometimes when I tell her no to situations, she gives me this pushy, bossy attitude. She doesn\u2019t take no for an answer.\n\nOne time we were driving in the city and she wanted to drive my car.  I kept telling her no and she just kept pushing and pushing and I just kept telling her no it\u2019s bad idea. I managed to not give in this time. \n\nWe usually go where she wants to go. One time I told her where I want to go, and she was like no no thank you.\n\nWe used to talk everyday but now I answer her phone calls less frequently.\n  \nSometimes I do feel bad for her. She is tackling two jobs, she is constantly stressed, tired, lonely. \n\nDespite her having those two jobs, we do manage to hang out a few times a month.\n\nI believe she has a good heart. She is very nice to people and she enjoys spending time with me. I understand she is struggling, but I feel she is just too much though. When I try to tell her how I feel, she thinks I\u2019m overreacting and then I feel guilty. Am I overreacting? \n\nPerhaps maybe I should start asking her for favors and see where that goes...\n\nI don\u2019t know if I should stay friends with her or not.

[x-post from r4r]", "author": "Emo-KyloRen", "self_text": " \n\nHello dearest Redditors! I have finally decided to give this a shot and see if it's possible to find a female friend from my tiny country here. I had some luck with this subreddit in the past and I am in a happy relationship with an amazing man, but I could really use a bff right now!\n\n**About me + who am I looking for?**\n\n* INFJ, 4w5, Pisces - meme or not, those psychology types describe me pretty damn well. I am extremely introverted and due to psychological reasons (see below), I find it difficult to connect with most people.\n* I suffer from AVPD as well as depression. It would be cool to find someone that also has experience with mental health issues as we could support each other through the daily struggle. It would be really nice to have someone who understands!\n* I've been working on my novel for quite some time, I dream of publishing it one day and touching the hearts of people that read it. A smaller wish of mine is too meet other writers and create a small community where we talk about our experiences, read our work, give helpful advice and constructive criticism etc. If you are also interested in writing, that would be a huge plus (but it's not a necessity).\n* Of course I also love reading, especially true crime non-fiction and thrillers. Many of my favorite books do not belong to those genres though, it's just that recently I find those type of books the easiest to read from start to finish (I begin reading A LOT of novels, but sadly I lose my interest before even I am halfway done... I have a particular taste and I am hard to please).\n* From time to time, I like to read about true crime. It interests me mostly from a psychological and sociological point of view as well as a cautionary tale. One case I am obsessed about is the Parker-Hulme murder. I have found out about it from the brilliant Peter Jackson movie and could not stop before I found out everything there is to know about it.\n* I've been interested in manga/anime and Japan for years though I am NOT into mainstream titles and I very rarely watch anime recently as it's hard to find something good which is not an adaptation of manga. I adore seinen titles like the work of Shuzo Oshimi, Inio Asano and Usamaru Furuya. My fave anime forever are Neon Genesis Evangelion and the works of Satoshi Kon.\n* This is the most obvious thing ever, but I adore Black Mirror and Bojack Horseman.\n* I love video games, though I have not been able to play much recently due to lack of time. I really enjoy more artsy and weird games like the MGS series, Silent Hill, Earthbound/Mother or indies like Night in the Woods (the last game I fell in love with). I recently got a Nintendo Switch and I am catching up to all the Nintendo games that I have missed out on like Breath of the Wild, Pokemon Let's Go or Super Smash Bros (would love to fight with a friend, though I am a newbie as I haven't played since Melee). Really looking forward to Animal Crossing too!\n* I am a collector of vintage My Little Ponies (aka G1, so not really into Friendship is Magic - sorry), dolls as well as anime figures. My collections are not very huge, but well-loved. I adore beautiful and cute/'kawaii' things in general.\n* When it comes to music, I am obsessed about HEALTH, Crystal Castles, The Birthday Massacre, Linkin Park, Lana Del Rey, A Perfect Circle and a few other choice projects.\n\nI would love to meet someone pretty similar to me for long online conversations, meeting up for a coffee, movie or shopping. If you are an introvert and share some of my passions, that would be pretty damn amazing.  \nPlease feel free to ask me anything (but keep in mind I will not answer if I feel uncomfortable).\n\n**Later on, I will be still checking this account from time to time (every week or so), so please write to me even if you found my post months from when it was published.**", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

He is my best friends brother, and there was a time I was hanging out with him everyday while I barely saw my best friend. We used to play Xbox all night, and he would always give me drugs without my asking. We bonded over it, which probably isn't a great foundation for friendship. But during that time I helped him with coming out of the closet, I taught him to shave, I taught him how to use makeup, I helped him learn how to dress stylish. I lost 50lbs at that time as well, and he followed my lead. I was really proud of him, and I thought we were really close. \n\nHe always seemed to have a wall up, though. He didn't want to talk about deep stuff, but I figured he just wasn't that kinda guy. I learned he was a compulsive liar really quick, and he would steal, too. He would make up stories about where he was, or about hooking up with people. He'd come home with things he's stolen from work, we worked at the same place, and laugh about it. I dismissed most of it, I thought it was a phase. At one point he was lying to people at my job, saying that I was a junkie, and that I would come to work high. I don't know why I completely ignored that, maybe because I had already quit when I found out.\n\nHe had a best friend who had a crush on me, and was always pushing me to give him a chance. I wasn't into it, but decided to give the guy a shot. Not even a week into it, the guy texts me, clearly beating around the bush to ask me something. He tells me that I have to promise not to say anything to my friend. I agreed, and he proceeds to ask me if it's true that me and my friend had slept together. I told him no, and that it doesn't even make sense considering my friend is gay and I'm a female. He told me that my friend was bragging about how we hooked up. I was so angry, and felt completely violated and betrayed. I never mentioned anything, mostly because I already knew he would deny it like he denies everything. Doesn't matter how many people confront him. \n\nWe don't talk anymore. I feel like I had poured so much of my heart into this friend, just to be betrayed. I still worry about him, he's been going through a string of abusive relationships. But I know he doesn't care about me at all, it's like I was just stepping stone for him to get want he wants. I miss the old times, but I know that the entire thing was toxic. ", "subreddit": "friendship"}

All right, I\u2019m not sure how to phrase this without sounding like an ungrateful POS friend, but here it goes. \n\nBackground: I used to go to school with this friend until we graduated. We did not stay in touch after graduation, but I would randomly see him out and we were always friendly with each other (platonically). I am a female and he is a male. \n\nRecently, this friend reached out to me and since has has been trying to constantly keep in touch. By constantly I mean he started texting me about anything and everything. When I didn\u2019t respond to text (because I was busy), he would send things through DM on Instagram and through messenger on Facebook. I assumed it was to get my attention so I\u2019d respond to him. About a week after \u201ccatching up via text\u201d he started trying to make plans to hang out. I hesitated to hang out with him at first, but then we did and things were ok meaning he wasn\u2019t clingy in person. Since our hangout, he has tried to plan an additional 4 other activities to do together. I told him I might be going out of town this weekend (because I honestly got overwhelmed and needed an excuse to tell him I couldn\u2019t hang out this weekend) and in the span of 3 days, he has asked me 3 separate times if I\u2019m still going out of town. I KNOW that if I tell him I\u2019m not, he\u2019ll try to make plans. I told him I was coming back Sunday night and he tried to make plans with me for that evening. When I said no, he wanted to make plans for Monday evening instead. \n\nSide note: when he texts me, he drops all of these emotional bomb shells on me, such has the medical problems his family is currently facing and he vents about work. We\u2019re not that close and he\u2019s sharing very personal information to which I don\u2019t even know how to respond to. \n\nI guess my question is how to I handle this without being insensitive and a shitty person? Before anyone asks, he\u2019s shown no signs of \u201ctrying to hit on me\u201d rather it seems like he might just want to be friends. I\u2019m the kind of person where I need my space and I need to regroup after social interactions because I just get drained by them. How do I respond to him when he literally wants to hang out every single day and if we aren\u2019t hanging out, he wants to keep in constant contact?

Then came the only buff in the whole game that lasted until death and my friend belittled me because apparently it was stupid to assume buffs had durations.

If off it surfaces and behaves normally again.

I don't want to offend Christians, but sorry, it's not for me, I am tolerant, and it's the main thing.\nAll in all, the more I was thinking(philosophically) about the world I live in, the more I realized how rotten it is. And once I've got to that point that this world began to f*****g scare me. I've completely lost the understanding of some things that are treated as \"normal\" today.\nThe most crazy thing is that I can doubt even myself sometimes, because I feel that I am different from others. Last times I've even began to feel lonely (though I have GF and friends). I've began to feel that I don't have anyone who has the same thoughts, so we could discuss it all or just to be sure that we are not insane.\n\nMaybe it's some kind of a disease, who knows?\nIt all started 4 years ago, and it doesn't seem to get better.\n\nWrite me if you feel the same, i am tolerant to everybody, who is tolerant to me.\n\nAt least, I feel a bit better because I've told about it for the first time of this 4 years.\n\nP.S.

Thanks for happening to come across my post!\n\nSo I'm here on Reddit yet again because I feel so very lonely. I don't have many friends. In reality, the only friend I have is my girlfriend - whom I'm ever so grateful for - but social anxiety and general instability doesn't help me with my loneliness.\n\nI've been told by a few people on this Reddit that I care too much and that they tend to go for 1 a day messages or none for periods of time. For some reason, I can't handle that well since just as accused, I care too much! i always end up feeling that I've been too much in their face or something, and they won't let me help with they have a problem.\n\nIt just seems it's only my luck that the people I seem to click with aren't like me - they don't seem to be clingy or shy or anxious. \n\nSo please excuse my mini-rant, just jad ti throw that out there :p I'm not always negative like this! \n\nBut I guess if you're still reading this by now you may nor be bored of me yet :D\n\nSo I'm an 18 year old guy from the UK, and I'm a computer science student at university. I play video games and binge watch movies, and listen to a wide range of music (electronic quite often). I'd like to point out now that I'm very shy, dare I say extremely, but that doesn't prevent me from caring or initiating a conversation. I try to put my social anxiety and awkwardness behind me as to help reduce anxiety with you should you also be similar to me!\n\nSo I've not said too much about myself I know but I promise I'll do so over PMs! I'm just reaching out here to see if I can find someone who understands me, and may be also in a similar position of not many or no friends, or with social anxiety and shy like me. I want to show that I do care. If you're struggling or having a panic attack or just want to complain about how weird I am, go for it! Like I said, I'm clingy so please don't go leaving me because that's my weakness!\n\nAnyway yeah, I'm looking for anyone around 17/18 to 22, so around my age that seems to relate to anything in my post! It may be a good idea to even make a group with my girlfriend and you,  meaning we can play games or watch movies or something. Bonus is you make another friend exactly like me! My girlfriend is more comfortable with becoming friends with other girls, though I don't mins either! So guy or girl, or whatever, just go for it if you are really ready for an epic friend like me! (Hah like I'm the worst of the worst :p)\n\nOh well, nor sure if I'll even get any PMs but we'll see! Just PM some me some info about you and we can follow up from there!

I would much rather get 1 or 2 messages from people who I really have things in common with and who are looking for what I'm looking for than a million \"you seem cool\" or \"hi\" messages that lead nowhere. If this post isn't for you, not a big deal.\n\n**What I am looking for:**\n\nI'm looking to make a couple of good friends. Real friends. Ideally, what I want is to find 2 or 3 people who I get along with and who get along with each other and for us 3 to become the best of friends (complete with a hilarious group chat where we put all of our inside jokes and memes). lol. That is really my ultimate hope. I don't like Reddit messages very much, so I would prefer someone who is willing to chat on other apps.\n\nLooking for someone who is close in age and has things in common with me. Male or female is fine, but female is probably preferred.\u00a0I want someone who I can text. I would love for us to video chat some in the future, maybe watch movies together virtually, play games together on the PS4, play games together over Skype (I have cards against humanity).\u00a0I want us to talk about the mundane everyday stuff and the personal stuff that we usually don't share with other people eventually.\n\n**About Me:**\u00a0\n\n26 / F. African American. Working in the psychology field and the education field.\u00a0 Live in Colorado (for now). Grew up in Florida. Unmarried (so far). No kids (yet). No pets (never wanted one). Not really that into nightlife. Not all that into \"nerd culture\" like most of Reddit. Currently trying to develop good habits and lose some weight in the new year. Hoping to run a 10K race by May. INFJ.\u00a0\n\n**If you don't find these videos funny, we won't be good friends and this post probably isn't for you:**\n\n[https://youtu.be/ZHfuB-\\_pAQA](https://youtu.be/ZHfuB-_pAQA)\n\n[https://youtu.be/mHOxHtRcJPw](https://youtu.be/mHOxHtRcJPw)\n\n[https://youtu.be/-NkhD3xquMU](https://youtu.be/-NkhD3xquMU)\n\n**Some of my most visited subreddits:**\u00a0\n\n/r/AmIUgly\n\n/r/BadWomensAnatomy\n\n/r/BlackPeopleTwitter\n\n/r/BlackLadies\n\n/r/BrandNewSentence\n\n/r/ChoosingBeggars\n\n/r/FloridaMan\n\n/r/OldPeopleFacebook\n\n**My Interests:**\u00a0\n\n**Languages:** I speak English and some Italian. Planning to learn one other language in the future, but can't decide between German, Spanish, or Swahili.\n\n**Books:** I am an avid reader. Mostly fiction. Some children's books. I enjoy some graphic novels, as long as they don't involve Superheros.\u00a0\n\n**TV:** I like American &amp; British dramas (This Is Us, Insecure, Luther, Sherlock, Desperate Housewives) / comedies (Black-ish, Shameless, Atlanta). I also like comedy-news shows (The Daily Show / Last Week Tonight) and trashy reality shows (90 Day Fiance / Love After Lockup). I also like trashy dramas as well (Pose, Claws). Currently watching Black Mirror.\n\n**Movies:** I watch all kinds of movies. Mostly like Dramas and Comedies. I am not really a fan of old movies. I will watch some of the classics though. One of my favorite movies is Notes on a Scandal. I really enjoy movies and tv shows where the main character is really really crazy. For some reason, I find it hilarious.\u00a0\n\n**Video Games:** I play Detroit: Become Human, GTA V, SpiderMan, Sims 4, Fallout 4, and other games like that. If you have a PS4, we can be friends on there as well.\u00a0\n\n**Travel:** I have been to a few other countries and have lived in several states. Hoping to travel around more when I have more money.\n\n**Music:** I like\u00a0Adele, Bruno Mars, Beyonce, Carrie Underwood,\u00a0Ed Sheeran, Florence &amp; The Machine,\u00a0Imagine Dragons, One Republic, Rihanna, Shakira, Hamilton Soundtrack, The Lonely Island, Usher, Tupac, etc. Those are just the artists who I seem to have a lot of songs by on my phone.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

That was on a different account and almost as a different person; I came here when I needed help and just a friendly voice to listen and talk with.  Nowadays, I'm doing fantastic.  I've completed my college degree, working on my second, and have stable friends/social life.  I'm happy for one of the first times in my life, and it looks like things will only (mostly) improve from here!  \n\nNow, I not only want to make new friends, but I want to be a friend to anybody else who may need help like I did.  Whether it's to vent, for someone to bounce your darkest thoughts of, or just someone to chat and tell jokes with; I'll be here for you all.  I can give advice, if you accept that it will be from my point of view and my priorities; always remember when taking advice, that it comes from another person with another worldview.  I love you all and hope you the best!  Here's my introduction that I made on another subreddit.  Enjoy!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey everyone! So it's been awhile since I've posted on one of these subreddits and now that life has been relatively calm/boring, I wanted to try reaching out to people again. I posted here a little over a year ago, so if you want to see how this post compares to my last (and how I've changed in that time), feel free to creep on it! Although, I do believe that this account only had a post in [r/penpals](https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals) so it would have been tailored to that subreddit. Anyway, on to more about me!\n\nI currently attend Arkansas State University in Jonesboro, pursuing my second bachelor's degree; although really, it's just a continuation of the first. I completed my degree in Chemistry Education and passed my licensing exams for Chemistry and Physics, so now I'm wanting to finish an actual B.S. in chemistry itself. Luckily, that only requires about a semester and a half of classes. In the meantime, I focus on substitute teaching at the local high schools and tutoring college students both on and off campus. Basically just doing random work related to education to make ends meet until I finish my degree.\n\nI spend my free time reading (books, fanfiction, articles, basically anything) and sometimes playing games when I feel like it. Usually simple stuff like Call of Duty, etc. I have a cat whom I love dearly, even if she is [a little crazy](https://imgur.com/DAYphvm). I've been trying to get back into some movies so that I can have other things to occupy my time, but I'm not much of a solo movie watcher; I prefer having company and someone to chat with while I do so.\n\nI've lived all over the U.S. due to my time in the Air Force; this includes Missouri (born and raised), Utah (four years), Mississippi/Arizona (\\~6 months each), and now Arkansas. Of these, I'd probably call Utah my favorite area. The weather was fantastic (as far as temp goes) due to the dry air, even if the snow was crazy. The mountains were gorgeous as well! I'd like to continue visiting areas all over the world. In fact, starting in about 2-3 years I plan on using my summers to travel a bit. Hopefully I'll be established enough to visit the rest of the U.S. and the world! I've also been toying with the idea of moving to Europe for a few years and teach high school there. I would probably choose somewhere in the U.K. (specifically Scotland) or Ireland. This would be so I could make a living in an English-speaking area, but have a much more convenient living area to make trips to Asia, Africa, and Europe.\n\nAs far as personality, I'm really chill and laid back. Sarcasm and wit are my go-to for humor, although I do have a healthy appreciation for most personality types. I've always been a super friendly guy who loves to chat and just get to know people. I get interested in most anything science related (especially space science), but I also really enjoy history and art themes as well; hit me with your best facts/trivia bits!\n\nI hope that's enough to give you a decent idea of who I am and who I want to be. I'd love to chat with all of you, in any way you're comfortable with. Reddit, email, text, snail mail, Skype, anything works for me; I'm not picky at all. For anybody from other countries, I can also download phones apps (kik, hangouts, etc.) if you don't want to use Reddit for some odd reason. Send me a PM so we can get to know one another! Hopefully you all can help me decide my next book to read as well, since I'm almost finished with my current one and am having trouble deciding between my current options.

I work for a corporation that has gone from performance based to percent based, and know full well the promotion only gives me an extra dollar.

Sadly, many of us are going through hard times or feelings of boredom. We focus on what we\u2019re going through and how unbearable it is for us. In the midst of it all I think we lose sight of what matters. Most people don\u2019t come on here thinking, \u201cWho am I going to save today?\u201d They\u2019re thinking about who\u2019s going to save them. I don\u2019t want to be anyone\u2019s hero. I don\u2019t want to play therapist. I want to be close. Through the good times and the bad. I don\u2019t want to talk to you when I\u2019m bored and simply dispose of you afterwards.

I can spend hours there. I like to journal and read in my free time. I try and spend my first waking hour doing something I like. That often means reading up on skincare and makeup. I\u2019m not really into science, but the chemistry side of skincare is fascinating. Makeup is so detail focused, which I love despite hardly wearing it these days. There\u2019s something ritualistic about going through the motions, even if it\u2019s as simple as brushing your teeth. Life is too complicated as it is. It\u2019s nice to have an element of calm.\n\nI\u2019ve recently rediscovered swimming after snubbing it for six years. Turns out I love the water! I just don\u2019t like crowds. I love listening to music when I\u2019m doing something trivial like folding laundry. These days it\u2019s been a split between Bon Iver and Kate Bush, but give it a few days and I\u2019ll probably be listening to Kanye. I listen to classical most days.\n\nMy days are filled with studying. I fell back in high school due to being depressed for a couple years. Things did get better eventually, but I think it had a lot to do with me changing as a person. As for the studying, I have perhaps five credits left? I can\u2019t recall and don\u2019t care. It\u2019s just a matter of finishing. The exams are all open book. It\u2019s a pretty futile way of learning anything, so I can\u2019t say I\u2019m too thrilled. C\u2019est la vie. Nothing is forever, but the mentality can be so hopeless. Just wait, I\u2019ll go on a plane and suddenly I\u2019ll feel full of hope again! There\u2019s something about travel and planes that I can\u2019t help but love. I digress. After this, I\u2019m thinking of doing something creative. Possibly graphic design, but nothing is set in stone. I\u2019m not taking myself too seriously and I prefer that. I\u2019m a very lazy person. I only recently realised that I feel dreadful when I\u2019m not getting work done. So now I get work done to feel less dreadful.\n\nI\u2019m pretty chill, but once you get to know me I usually go back and forth between being chatty (like now) or quiet. My mood fluctuates, but I\u2019m generally pretty happy. My sense of humour is sarcasm and Borat quotes.\n\nThere\u2019s a couple friends who I really adore. We talk a fair bit and are there for each other. I\u2019m kind of in a place where I appreciate who I have, but don\u2019t beg for anyone. If someone stops talking to me or leaves me on read, that\u2019s on them. Sometimes things don\u2019t work out, but I\u2019m tired of people who want to be chased. Reciprocity is underrated. I\u2019m not getting any younger. Let\u2019s do away with the childish games and settle down. We only have so much time to love each other and be nice. Why not now?\n\nI\u2019ve decided this will be my final post. One day I\u2019ll delete this account. I\u2019m no longer in the mindset where I\u2019m seeking to be understood. If anything, I\u2019d rather take time to understand you. If we make a connection, it\u2019s beautiful. If not, at least we tried. I reply to most people. If I take awhile, chances are I\u2019m busy living life. If our conversation isn\u2019t working, I\u2019ll tell you how I feel. Ghosting is hurtful and I\u2019d really rather not.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I'm Luke, and I spent far too long writing this post! Inside you\u2019ll find some little tidbits about me, my dogs (pictures included) and hobbies and interests. I\u2019m here with intent of meeting new people.. and you\u2019re a new people! Say hi! If you want a face pic just ask, and I\u2019ll send you a reaaaly drunk and stoned picture, so you can see me at my worst, and have totally low expectations of me as a person, so I can blow you away with slightly above mediocre acts!\n\nI work full time, but I plan on slowing down a bit and studying Psychology, and working into forensic psychology, or something like that.. so I might be a tad slow to reply, but I promise I\u2019ll try my best to get back to you!\n\n**About Me:**\nI'm 20 Years old, and a Male. You probably worked this out from the title, and if you did you get +5 points (No cash value, and not redeemable for cash). I live in New Zealand (That's Middle-Earth, and the place they always forget to put on maps, see r/mapswithoutnewzealand) And I work so my 3 Dogs can live \"the life\". I actually grew up 7-17 years of age in Aussie, so I tend to resemble an Australian more in nature apparently. Weather or not that's a good thing can be at your discretion :)\n\n\n**My Hobbies:**\n\n* My main hobby / interest, that has been with me since I could talk, has been Aquatics. It's something I feel I could write a book about at this stage, not to toot my own horn, but I've been doing it for the past 15 odd years. I currently own 3 Fish Tanks, although I'm going to be downsizing, so I only have two to maintain. I enjoy Aquascaping, and used to be heavily involved in breeding fish, and selling them around Australia before I moved back. Since moving back I landed a job in a Pet Store though, and I think that's certainly enough \"Business\" in the hobby for me. Haha.\n\n* Secondly, I guess gaming comes under a hobby now adays. I will write a more detailed section with some of the games I've been playing, and what consoles etc. I own later on in my post. \n\n* My Dogs get an honourable mention here, too, as they are a large chunk of my life (And paycheck, *groan*). [From top to bottom, Smarty the Greyhound, Tobias the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and Paddington my Grumpy Old Man (breed unknown!)](http://prntscr.com/l49p7g) I always take photos of these guys, and will probably spam you with them, and if that's not OK then I'm not sure what we're going to do about that!\n\n* Thirdly, I'm starting to get into my cars a lot. I recently found a dream car of mine (Young guy growing up on Need for Speed, Fast &amp; Furious etc. how could this NOT be a dream car?) for a good price in good shape, and made the jump. [This is my Nissan Fairlady Z, 2004](http://prntscr.com/l49o9q). She might be close to stock minus a custom exhaust to pull out the beautiful sound that is the Z's engine (Seriously, one of the best sounding cars in my honest opinion), and a stiff lowered suspension.. But she's mine, and I'm hoping to pull a bit of the interior out and re do it (Headunit is first on the list, but I'm also considering repainting the interior console etc.). \n\n* Next on my list of things that makes me, me, is T.V Shows, and Movies. Once again, I'll throw down a more detailed section on this, as I feel it's a little more in depth than I can give credit for in a small section here.. Although, my last little bits have been rather lengthy...\n\n* Writing! I haven't written anything for a few years now, but I always have ideas popping into mind. I'd really like to get back into writing.. perhaps you're a bit of a scribe yourself and want to run some ideas past each other?\n\n* Art! I've always loved Bob Ross and his art styles. I'd love to give it a crack some day, as well as getting back into playing the Cello (Did it as a kid, but my parents couldn't afford me one when it came time to go to high school..)\n\n* And finally, as opposed to a lengthy list of small time hobbies, I'll just put in some Honorable here.. Drones (I haven't flown mine for over a year, the laws are getting so restrictive here..), Music (All genres!), Nature (Even if I don't get out in it as much as I'd like, my entire life goal revolves around owning my own slice of nature) and occasionally getting absolute piss faced or high, and smashing out online video games.\n\n**Vidya Games**\n\nGreat job making it this far in my epoch of information about the human-being that is I. +5 points!\n\nI use video games to unwind a bit after work, and a way to stay socially active. I play on PC, but I am *not* adverse to buying a console to play with you, if we click well. Hell, I bought myself a really nice TV for my room I barely use, that'd put it to some use huh?\n\n* **World of Warcraft** . WoW gets the first mention here. I was introduced to it after countless hours as a youngin' with my Dad playing Warcraft 2 and 3 on LAN games together, and he found out about the game through a co-worker, and I managed to get my little hands on a copy as well. I guess like many my age who were exposed to this game, it has kind of moulded me a bit. I'll *always* play WoW in one way or another. I went through a phase where I even learnt some programming skills and worked on a private server for a short while. I'm *very* excited for Classic WoW (The only expansion I've never played, outside Private Servers). I main a Warrior on Horde (Always have, always will) and would LOVE some people to play with. Hell I am open to transferring realm and faction to play with you, if you like. Hell, if you play private servers I'm happy to jump on with you. \n\n* **Shooters**. Broad genre.. I wasn't ever a big shoot 'em up fan as a kid, more of your typical RPG nerd, but CS 1.6 had me sinking many hours into it. Even if it was just offline with bots, it translated into a love for CS:GO when it was released, and I racked up a *disgusting* amount of hours on that game. Worth it, I met some cool people and had fun. \nBattle Royal games are.. great, but lost my interest. I'd love to try get back into PUBG, and maybe Blops 4's Blackout.. But I find them way too stressful to play alone. Prior to full release I actually had a pretty awesome win rate of like 15% on PUBG, but I suck now lol. \n\n* **RTS** I suck real bad at these. I'm not sure if it's the fact I like to watch things happen, or I like to plant that farm perfectly around the mill.. Whatever it is, I suck. That's OK, I still love these games, and if you want someone to thrash around, I'm ya guy. (Considered a winky face here, but let's get to know each other a little more before we throw those around!). I was an Empire Earth fanboy, and dabbled in Age of Empires (Blessed was that [Disc you got in Kellogs Cereal..](http://prntscr.com/l49rrw)). Warcraft 3 Reforged hype anyone?\n\n* **RPG** I love RPG games, but I can't say I get too into them now a days. However, I\u2019m happy to give something a crack with you, or via suggestion if you want someone to nerd out over something with? Does GTA V Count? I'd love to find some people to play that with, too. Oh, and Destiny 2, me and my one friend (That's a whole big number eh?) started playing. Seems cool but I'm only level 20.\n\n* **Strategy** Once again, not a strong point, but I love 'em. I think I put about 30 hours into one Civ V game once, and I can't say I regret that. I don't own Civ VI as I've heard V is still superior, but I'd happily pick it up, as with any other game you'd like to try. Did get taught to try everything once, right?\n\n\n[Here's a link to my steam profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/floppydiskinmyanus/). Feel free to check out what games I own and have been playing lately, and send me a friend request. If you do, just comment on my profile so I know you're not a bot :)\n\nGreat job making it this far through, that was a chunk of text huh. I promise it doesn't get much more exciting!\n\n**Movies &amp; Shows**\n\nI love just chilling back and watching stuff. I would be keen to watch movies &amp; shows with you, we can just download 'em and hit play at the same time over voice, works well. My all-time favourite show is Seinfeld, but there are many other close contenders. [Reno 911](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0370194/) and [King of The Hill](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118375/) come to mind immediately, but there are so many I watch that it's hard to think of them all..\n\nAs for movies, I am a big fan of Epic Fantasy style films. I feel like it should be law that everyone watches the extended Lord of the Rings trilogy in one sitting, once a year, complete with snacks to go all the way without having to stop. In saying that, I can be a bit picky about some films, namely Harry Potter.. I'm not a big fan of it? I feel like I'm going to be attacked for that one, haha. My all time favourite film is [The Room](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368226/) which has caught a bit more mainstream popularity lately. It really shows off that I have a deep and religious love for cheesy and poorly made films. Hell, I think I watched one called Pirahnaconda or something similar once, and couldn't help but rewatch it less than a week later.\n\nI'd love to write out a detailed section for my music interests, but it's all over the place. Really. no genre is disliked. Please send me some good beats? :)\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nWell, I'm now at 8669 characters and counting. I'm sure this is enough of a read for you to get a bit of an idea for who I am, and what I enjoy. Wether or not you want to PM me and say Hi!, or just pass on through and silently judge me for blurbing real hard on the internet, that's cool. Below is a little list of ways you can contact me, but you're also more than welcome to just drop me a little orange mail icon. Those are exciting to see. I look forward to hearing from you! I know it might seem intimidating to try and make a reply to such a big post, but just drop a line, and a little fact about yourself if you like and we can go from there!\n\n* Discord: lukelukeluke#8815\n\n* Battlenet: Dog#11312\n\n* Facebook, Snapchat and others: Please ask! I don't use social media quite as much (Barring shitposting on facebook) so Discord really is the best way to get ahold of me, but if that wont work please PM me, I'm sure we can figure out something! I just refuse to use Skype!\n\nThanks again for reading. I hope I can make a life-long buddy or two through this. Worst case.. well I meet the reincarnation of Genghis Khan or something... but I'm sure it can't be that bad... right?", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I'm a recently graduated high school student in that awkward spot between high school and university. I was born in the Philippines though I spent well over half of my life here in the remote city of Perth. \n\nIn high school, I have been studious - choosing to focus on my exams rather than on making new friends. I guess it paid off as I did get a high ATAR number but in return my social life became non-existent. I have made a few real friends in high school and I hold each of them **dearly**. I kinda want to make up for the years lost and to get to know more people. \n\nHere's a *brief* description of me **\\[Headers are bolded for TL;DR.

Someone with an ideal they were willing to strive for; a part of themself they held-firm for someone special. Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of option, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person.\n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers).\n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values).\n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

There are so many challenges when you are young, and they can grow to overshadow everything else in life, but there is something on the other side.\n\nYour worldview is still growing, your reach expanding, these obstacles may seem insurmountable but don't underestimate the strength of time.

I fell asleep and dropped it my phone and everything was gone. Maybe I'll try tomorrow, it's not like my life will have changed.

Shooters are ok, but not my preferred type of game, and I've played MMOs, and a friend recently talked me into at least a month of WoW. I watch a fair amount of tv and movies, as well as being a pretty avid reader (though this kind of comes and goes). I do some outdoorsy stuff, but not really when I hang out with friends. I'm just looking for some good hang outs and conversation.\n\nI am looking for people who try not to be racist, sexist, homophobic, fatphobic, etc. It's important to me to be friends with people who care about and try to understand others.

I listen to it, share it, create it, and mix it. I'm very into sharing music with others, learning about their tastes, and even seeing if I can get them into something new.\n\nI'm also very, very big into anime as well, and one thing I've been searching for big time, is someone that I could sit down for a few days or nights a week with, and watch some new series together, and discuss it.\n\nI'm also a very avid gamer as well, focusing on PC, Switch, and PS4. My favorite genres are RPGs, JRPGs, MMOs, and all sorts of others where I can sink tons of time into. Right now I'm playing Kingdom Hearts 1.5 and the Higurashi VNs, and I'm also binging through Kamen Rider Build when I'm not gaming or working.\n\nAlso, I'm very LGBT+ friendly. As a bisexual man myself, I would be delighted to meet other gay, bi, trans, people! I like talking to everyone, whether they be guys or girls.\n\nWhen it comes to friendship, I'm looking for someone that isn't afraid to be themselves around me, and won't be afraid of talking to me when something is amiss. I want to be there, not only for the good times, but also the bad ones as well.\n\nI'm a very approachable person despite being quite pessimistic and cynical, but I'm also very caring deep down.

Just a personal thing, really.\n\nI hate feeling so lonely, I really do. It's gotten to a point where I really feel like I don't have anyone, especially since at this age, most friendships are comprised of co-workers, and where I work, no one wishes to be friendly with each other.\n\nI just wish I could have someone that actually cares about how I'm doing. Wants to talk about their day, whether it was good or bad. Someone who goes above and beyond simple small talk. Someone who I can be talking to for years, and years on end, and truly feel that special bond. Is anyone really out there, anymore? :/ These are the people I REALLY want to find.\n\nI really, and sincerely hope I can meet some delightful people today. &lt;3", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Here\u2019s a bit of info about myself, and if you like what you see feel free to pm (idc about gender or location just please nobody over 18. Also someone preferably from the US)\n\nWell to start, I\u2019m a 15 year old skinny white kid who lives in South Florida and is a Freshman in high school. I\u2019m tired of all the fake bs \u201cfriends\u201d and people who don\u2019t give a fuck about you, despite you caring about them. I\u2019m tired of acting like somebody I\u2019m not when I\u2019m out with people, and of all the fake people in the world. I\u2019m tired of always feeling either hated or ignored. I'm tired of all the self pity and self harm. I\u2019m just looking for someone that can care about me as much as I care about them, who I can have deep or silly convos with late at night and be myself around. Idk I\u2019ve just been pretty lonely lately, despite being around people who say they care about me but apparently not enough to be there for me now.\n\n\nFor entertainment I like to listen to music, watch YouTube and Netflix (currently watching Game of Thrones), row, talk to people, play games, work out, occasionally smoke weed. Feel free to talk to me and hmu whenever because I have all the time in the world. Also, don\u2019t worry about being left on read or not being responded to quickly, because my phone is always up my ass and I\u2019m always on it when I\u2019m not busy.\n\nIn terms of music, I mainly listen to mainstream rap, and occasionally old school 90s rap and sad rap (like Joji and shit like that). I also have recently been getting into the $uicideBoy$ a lot lately. But I like a lot of music from all genres and time periods, just mainly rap. My friend has also been trying to get me to start watching anime a bit, so if you watch any be sure to shoot me any show recommendations . In terms of games (I don\u2019t really play any anymore but if you want I\u2019d be glad to get back into it), but I play Red Dead 2, God of War, CSGO, Fortnite, Call of Duty, and my favorite games of all time are the Dark Souls/Bloodborne series (I have a PC that I built, a PS4, and a switch). But, Im pretty open and will listen to, watch, or play, or talk about whatever you want me to. Also, another perk of talking with me is that I\u2019ll send you shitty deep poems and lyrics.\n\nReligiously I\u2019m a christian, but I never mention it and I don\u2019t force it on people, and recently I\u2019ve been having struggles with my faith. I also have 3 dogs which I really enjoy chilling with.\n\nSport wise i do competitive rowing (yes like on a boat) on my schools team, and despite it being pretty hard I enjoy it. So if anyone is a fellow rower hmu and maybe I can get some advice on technique, steady state erg workouts, or weight training.\n\nBut anyways, I know this post has been a mess so far \ud83d\ude15, but anyone who is still reading hmu if interested. Honestly, I\u2019m just looking for someone where we can be real with each other and get to know one another, tell funny and embarrassing stories and goof around with and vent to each other and etc. I don\u2019t even know why I wasted my time typing this because I know nothing will come out of it, but hopefully something does and I can overcome all this shittiness. Feel free to shoot me a pm, and from there we can take it to snap (or discord if u want). Thanks for reading this!\n\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I've been trying to think of a clever, funny way to start this post, but if you couldn't tell, I'm failing miserably. I like to think I'm funny, but most of the time, I'm really not. I decided to post on here finally because although I do have a few friends, they don't talk to me a ton and I get kind of lonely sometimes and would like new people to interact with.\n\nAnyway, so I'm 19 and of the female gender. I am a college student in the midwest USA, studying computer science and religious studies. This means yes, I'm a super big fan of coding! Also, I am Catholic and very dedicated to my faith, which I would love to talk about, but I am definitely fine with it if we have religious differences. I also love sports. Specifically, I'm one of those weird people who likes to run. In the winter, I also enjoy cross country skiing! As for watching sports, I'm obsessed with baseball. I'm mainly a Red Sox and Brewers fan, but I also like the Rockies and Royals on the side. I know, I have a lot of teams, but I have that many teams because I just love baseball so much. I also watch football, basketball, and hockey sometimes as well to which I am respectively a Packers, Celtics, and Oilers fan.\n\nOther than that stuff, I also have some other hobbies. I don't really play video games anymore, but I used to play lots of Minecraft and Sims, and I still play OOTP sometimes. I also watch Fortnite and some other games on Twitch. I'm also a big fan of the board variety of games.\n\nI'm also a big fan of reading. There are so many books I love! I'm a big fan of scifi and classics, but I read most genres. I'm fairly new to watching lots of TV shows because I got Netflix fairly recently, but I like TV as well! Big Brother, Friends, and Arrested Development are three shows I enjoy a lot. I also spend lots of time lurking on reddit, no surprise there.\n\nI also listen to music a lot... Again lots of different genres. And I love learning about personalities, I'm an ISFJ and a type 2 on the enneagram test.\n\nOh, yeah. And I really like dogs.\n\nThanks for reading!

So I went to college and met my best friend Steph who is one of those dream friends like total bff kinda shit like we know what our nipples look like and we\u2019ve cried when we\u2019re drunk and done dumb shit level of friendship the kinda thing I would dream about in school. No one ever gave a shit about me before college and she made me feel so wanted and so great about myself like she would hype me up for guys and we lit could do nothing all day and still have a good time. And I\u2019m not the most social butterfly type and I barley talk online in fact she\u2019s the only girl I actually talk to on Snapchat so she\u2019s pretty special to me. So now that there is a new year of college new girls have joined the course and she\u2019s going through the phase with these two other girls, but she used to jokingly get jealous when I met for coffee with one of my old school friends so i dunno if she was joking but she got jealous really easily and I didn\u2019t wanna lose her so I practically cut off all other people for her, but then she can snapchat and hug and hang around with these other girls and I won\u2019t get jealous cause I\u2019m not like that. But now I\u2019m kinda sad cause I\u2019m not a priority anymore to her and I don\u2019t have anyone else that\u2019s close with me really so now I have no one and she has anyone she chooses.

I get frustrated about the type of friends I end up making, and how they get so jealous of each other. Most of it is my own fault, as I am male and make mostly female friends. I make the effort to connect with guys, but my personality, being heterosexual, and the area that I live in make it extremely difficult to connect with other men (mostly my personality, which makes me seem borderline pansexual even though I have no interest in anything other than females).\n\nSo, as to the main reason I vent: each friend I have made gets jealous of the other friends I have or could possibly make. The degree in which they get jealous varies, greatly depending on how close we may become. Most of the time I suspect they harbor romantic interests with me, but rarely do I ever get even a strong hint that they feel that way. I can't even mention one name to another without getting an icy wall of contempt or some additional distance.\n\nTo be clear, none of these women are in a committed relationship with me, and I would have to assume that I could not continue to add to my friends list as easily if I was in a committed relationship. I do know a couple of friends that are in one with someone, and they are *slightly less* jealous of my other friends than the rest get.\n\nIt frustrates me because I have tried to either get them to just fess up to any feelings they may have or get over me having other friends, to no avail on both efforts. It has gotten really bad over the last couple of months as I have lost two friends I thought could tolerate my personality and friendship style only to find out that they couldn't share me with others.\n\nI almost want to just lose them all and start over, but I don't make friends easily in the first place. I'm sure if I had a girlfriend much of this would clear up on it's own, but I am in year three coming out of a protracted separation/divorce and women avoid the possibility of a commitment to me at the moment (or this might be a common trend now amongst the 26 to 36 year old demographic).\n\nAnyway, sometimes the drama makes my life a living hell knowing that I can either deal with all the cattiness and back biting, or just be alone 90% of the time because I don't have family or other friends to fill in that crucial gap.\n\nEdit: In the interest of answering a couple of questions I figured would pop up quite quickly - Yes, I have expressed a romantic interest to few of these friends before the relationship type was decided; and yes, a couple of them are considered \"beneficial\" for a lack of a better term. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I don't make hard lines about sex and friendship just because society does.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She said absolutely, she would do it! \n\n(Side note..She later told me she was getting married but it was a small quickly planned ceremony and only family was really invited. So I was happy for her but was fine not being invited to her wedding)\n\n\nThe wedding came and went, we hung out, I was happy and felt like everything was great.  After, I would sometimes send her a message about something and almost never hear back.  I only texted or called or emailed her rarely.  I figured she just was busy with her life. \n\nA couple of years later, My husband and I were going to attend a wedding in her area, so I reached out to let her know in the hopes we could connect.  I heard nothing, so I tried email, voice mail, etc, assuming her number maybe changed. Nothing.\n\nFinally I asked if things were okay, and if something was wrong or if I had done anything.  Nothing.  I realized that she had blocked me from her social media (I have no idea how long I\u2019d been blocked for, either, because I had no reason to think I was blocked\u2014in fact I figured she was just no longer in fb, but she was still friends with my mom, so I realized she totally still has a profile, but has blocked me).  \n\nI sent one final text just saying something like \u201chey.  I am wondering if you are avoiding me.  If you are, I don\u2019t know why.  If I did something, I\u2019m sorry. If you want to talk, I\u2019ll be here.  You know how to reach me.\u201d\n\nThat was a year or so ago.  And it still stings.  This person was my absolute best friend for almost all of college.  We were so close.  We became distant, which was fine, but she has literally cut off contact from me.  I have no idea what happened.  She has always been bad with confrontation, so it\u2019s possible I did something and she just didn\u2019t want to tell me. \n\nI am 30 years old, and I still think about her every week, at least.  It really hurts.  I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to be done, but I feel ashamed for some reason, and my memories of college now have a sadness to them.  \n\n(Side note\u2014we paid for her hotel and everything when she came to be my bridesmaid (my parents did this for the \u201cyoung out of town bridal party\u201d to be nice, it wasn\u2019t special treatment).  I got the strong sense her mom, who was close to her, thought my family was a bunch of rich snobs...this isn\u2019t true, but she seemed to think so, but was thrilled for us to pay for tons of stuff regarding her kid.  My former friend also would say her mom thought my depression was dragging my friend down and keeping her from her full potential). \n\nI just wish she had said no to the wedding if she had an issue...I look back on photos that include her and it makes me sad now.  The other girls in my bridal party also drifted from me (they were newer friends though and that\u2019s not so weird, and they had some life changes that make sense to me).

I told him that this could end up being a good thing for him, because he will be forced to have a healthier life (he really had a drinking problem at this moment).\n\nTwo months passed and everything seemed to be going very well. He stopped drinking since he found out about the diabetes, and he became a better person. \n\nBut then things started to go in the wrong direction. 6 months have passed and he is drinking even more than before. That's all that he's doing. I tried to do anything to make him stop, but nothing seems to work. I am seriously thinking that he is slowly killing himself.\n\nCan you please advice on how to make him quit drinking?\n\nTLDR: my bestfriend has type 1 diabetes and he gets drunk everyday.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm a 20 M from New Zealand and I'm currently in a university studying software engineering. I'm not doing badly, but I feel like I could do so much more if I didn't spend all my time playing video games like League of Legends or browsing memes. I have reasonably strict Asian parents who want me to get a degree and a job so I can sustain myself. They don't believe in me much, often calling me disorganized, irresponsible and a disappointment, which is understandable as I have often fell prey to procrastination. I want to prove them wrong this year. I am going to WORK my ass off on my goals, ace my exams and do as much as I can so when I look back at the end of the year, I won't have any regrets for the first time.\n\nI am looking for someone who shares the same sentiment as me. Someone who is looking to prove to the world or to themselves that they can amount to something if they tried. Someone who wants to make a difference in the world. We will help each other achieve our goals by organizing a time everyday for both of us to study without distractions (we could share screens to make sure the other's not getting distracted lol... idk I'm open to suggestions), and keep each other constantly updated on our progress. We will also be honest with each other. Seriously, if you think I'm wrong on something then just tell me so. I can take criticism. If you need someone to talk to or blow off steam, I'm willing to listen.\n\nMy current goal while on uni break is to learn music production with FL studio so I can eventually release songs and gain popularity. I also eventually want to branch off into game design and Youtube content creation. Once university starts, I want to get A's in every single course as well as continuing to work on my goals.\n\nI'm really shy and insecure so it's taken a lot of determination for me to write this up. I don't really know anyone who shares the same sentiment as me, so I'm really hoping that I can find someone to work with!\n\n**A little about me:**  \n\n\nI'm a huge video game enthusiast. My favorite game is League of Legends and I peaked challenger 300 lp in season 8. I have also dabbled in osu!, Hearthstone, Maplestory, Minecraft and a bunch of other games. I am willing to completely stop playing or severely cut my play time to achieve my goals for this year.I love listening to all kinds of music, ranging from heavy metal to chill piano to dubstep. Lately I've been listening to a lot of electronic music, dubstep and Monstercat. My favorite song is either Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen or My Shot from Hamilton.\n\nI browse memes unhealthily often. Prequel memes, league memes, pewdiepie memes, you name it.I don't enjoy travelling. I think it's a waste of time which can be used on picking up new skills and making the world a better place.\n\nI don't play much sports but I do enjoy badminton. I seldom go to the gym but would like to go more often to keep fit.\n\nI read and watch a fair amount of anime and manga. I'm a big fan of Deku from My Hero Academia as he carries a lot of qualities which I resonate with.I enjoy programming and software engineering. I can currently code in java, python and a few others but don't find it that hard to pick up new programming languages.  \n\n\nI'm going to bed now since it's 3 AM here, but I'll answer everyone who's interested when I wake up tomorrow.

I told A about my plans and then he got \u201cupset\u201d and we threw some insults but it was nothing serious and mostly joking. \n\nSo the basketball game ended and then me, A, and J all went up to our other 3 friends who were on the team (I\u2019ll call them C, N, and M). When we went up, A told everyone about my plans and they all got upset. Not super serious but still a little upset. I didn\u2019t want to tell them where I was going cause I knew they would just end up going there and try to sit next to us. When I wouldn\u2019t tell them, they tried calling and texting Death Row to try and find out. The MF\u2019s told me that they would just follow me to wherever I was going. Well, I wasn\u2019t leaving until around 7:45-ish to go to the football game so I was going to go home first and chill for a bit before i left since it was only 7:00. \n\nAs I was leaving, I saw that they were all following me so I pulled into a plaza that was right next to my house and parked. They blocked me into my spot and started questioning where I was going and what I was doing. I told them I was going home first and then they started talking about where they were going to eat. As they were discussing what they were going to do, I told them I was going to go home. M had to move his truck because there was someone waiting behind him, so I pulled out after the car passed and as I got onto the road again, C pulled in front of me along with M and A going behind me (it\u2019s a side road that no one ever really goes on so it\u2019s not that much of a disturbance). C started going 10 mph and then eventually let me go. At this point I was already pretty pissed because they\u2019re not just letting me be and they always get hurt if I make plans with people besides them it seems. \n\nSo the time comes and I go to the ale house where Death Row is and we all sit down. About 10 minutes in, they both have to use the restroom. As they were in there, I see the MF\u2019s out of the corner of my eye and they all sit in the booth with me laughing and saying stuff like \u201cfunny seeing you here\u201d. Turns out the MF\u2019s coordinated with Death Row to surprise me I guess. I was noticeably upset and they laughed but they left and Death Row came back to sit and were laughing as well. I wasn\u2019t mad for long and everything was normal again.\n\nThis is where it gets bad to me. After that happened, the MF\u2019s decided to eat at the ale house as well but they were on the opposite side of the restaurant. I found out that some of the MF\u2019s were trying to convince Death Row to leave me and to eat with them instead and saying all this stuff. Death row told me what the MF\u2019s said and I was getting upset again. One of the members of Death Row, \u201cH\u201d, was laughing at her phone and kept showing the other member of Death Row, \u201cS\u201d, something on her phone. This went on for around 10 minutes and I pretended to be hurt because they weren\u2019t telling me something. They said that they would tell me when we were outside and leaving. The rest of the dinner went fine watching the game, eating, and talking. Once we got outside I asked what it was. Turns out, the MF\u2019s decided to spray silly string on the rear window spelling \u201cBros before Hoes\u201d and H recorded my reaction and sent it to them. I got pissed again and went home to clean it off. The silly string got in the cracks of back of the car and I\u2019m having a hard time getting it out. I haven\u2019t really responded to any of the MF\u2019s all day. I realize that it\u2019s only silly string but it\u2019s not as much about the silly string as it is about the whole situation of them following me and not letting me make plans and having a life. I could be overreacting but I just wanted some second opinion.\n\nTl;dr: I made plans to watch football with 2 girls rather than my main group of friends who didn\u2019t talk to me about any plans. They got their feelings hurt, blocked me in a parking lot, trailed me to see where I was going, and silly stringed my car saying \u201cbros before hoes\u201d. Haven\u2019t talked to them really and want to know if I\u2019m overreacting", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I struggled to make friends growing up and keep them. I had little advice from others on how to succeed ( i suppose my parents were too engrossed in their own life dramas).

After enough failure i gave up in many ways as a teenager, stopped taking social risks, took the easy route out and generally over invested in the few friends i had. Socially i have felt like a beggar for years always watching from the outside as people who i considered normal went to normal events and had fun. Outside of drinking or porn their has been little pleasure for me. College was the most traumatic 6 years of my life and just thinking about how much i threw away all my social opportunities makes me cry. Now i am going on 2 years out of college, and i live at home with parents ( to save money mostly) but deep down i am terrified of how lonely i am going to feel walking into my own house knowing at 27 years old i still don't have the social skills to build a relatively healthy social life.

I've also heard about her saying stuff behind my back. even worse, whenever I try to confront her about it she flips it and I end up apologizing.

I'm quite open once you get to know me, and if I'm comfortable around someone I have no problems talking about literally anything. I just wish for you to bear with me at the beginning if you choose to talk to me, just a bit until I get comfortable and it'll be a blast.\n\nSo I guess it's time to talk about myself.\n\n\\- I'm, yes, a gamer. Most of the time I play League of Legends, or just replaying the Mass Effect Trilogy over and over, however I enjoy World of Warcraft a lot when I have people to play with. Besides those, the rest that I play are mostly single player games that are either story based (I loved Life is Strange), or just random games that I resonate with in terms of gameplay (Enter the Gungeon). I also love playing the old Spyro games for PS1, and my favorite game of all time maybe, Crash Bash (PS1).\n\n\\-Besides that, I actually love playing board games. Sadly, most of my irl friends don't like them, and those that do don't have much time for them. We usually just play card games (which I'm a big fan of) instead. Also I have recently joined a DnD group and I'm having a blast there as well.\n\n\\-I'm really interested in science in general, how stuff works. It's mostly physics (I'm planning to go to uni to study physics), but literally anything works. I don't know that much about it (I know enough to sometimes start a conversation though), but I easily understand what's being explained to me and I love thinking and discussing science.\n\n\\-I listen mostly to metal music, however the bands I listen to have changed over the years, and I still like everything I have listened in the past, it's just that I've moved to (in my opinion) better music. Right now my favorite bands are BMTH, Enter Shikari and Korn, I enjoy metalcore the most, however I can listen to nearly any metal song if I feel the music and lyrics. Some other bands that I love listening to are In Flames, Lamb of God, Parkway Drive, In This Moment, We Came As Romans and a lot lot more, these are just my current favorites. Besides metal I can listen mostly to anything, I just don't like songs that I don't resonate with in terms of lyrics.\n\n\\-I like to occasionally draw (usually anime style though), and recently I've picked up some acrylic colors to paint with. I'm still new and not that good, but I really enjoy the idea of art even though I don't quite do it well yet.\n\n\\-Yeah and I watch anime. My favorite anime are Steins;Gate, Death Parade, No Game No Life, Code Geass and Zankyou no Terror. I watched a few more as well (I'm more of a casual watcher than a huge fan, but I enjoy it). To contradict what i just said: I also finished watching Naruto. Besides anime I enjoyed a few TV shows, but nothing too memorable to talk about here, that was mostly just me killing time.\n\nYeah that was a bit longer than I hoped, however if you have already come this far please don't hesitate to message me. I'm open to all sorts of conversations, and enjoy talking about life a lot. I'd also like to know as much as possible about you, your hobbies and what you do in life, however mundane it might sound.\n\nEDIT: Yeah I guess it would make sense to note that I'm located in the Balkans (Europe)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We were supposed to meet up in her city for NYE  and I said I\u2019d stay with her for the next two days as well, and I\u2019d be going away for vacation with my family immediately afterwards. \n\nWell, somehow either I wasn\u2019t exactly clear enough about how many days I\u2019d be staying with her or she misunderstood me (idk) but she thought I\u2019d be staying with her for the whole week and lost her shit when she realized I was only staying two days.

After talking things out with her, she said she\u2019d be fine and we should just enjoy each other\u2019s company for the little time that we had. Fast forward to NYE, we went to this club that sounded lit af in all of its social media flyers but ended up being a joke because very few people showed up and the DJ cancelled as a result. We just went to a different bar, had a few drinks, and watched the ball drop on TV. I was trying to make the best of it but she was just complaining the whole time about how the way you spend NYE sets up the mood for the whole year, so her entire year is going to be a disappointment because of me. \n\nWe were fine the next 2 days, went sightseeing and had a lot of fun and she apologized again for complaining. I thought we were all good until the moment I was packing my bags to take the train back home when she was persistently begging me to stay with her. I kept apologizing and promising her that I would come back as soon as I returned from my trip but she just kept crying and begging me to stay. I eventually left when I was not even close to calming her down because I was about to miss the train. I decided I wouldn\u2019t bother her and wait for her to call me when she gets over it.

I just thought to myself \"Whatever\" and went with doing some of my homework. As people start to arrive they start to pick up on her being in a mood and start asking her what's wrong and she says that's she's not mad at anyone. I then speak up and jokingly say \"She's probably mad at me\", the then proceeds to just tell me to shut up. This is when I realize that she's actually mad at me. I start to wonder to myself what exactly happened over the span of the weekend and we had not talked at all, she even cancelled our plans to hang out. Later, we are second hour and she normally sits next to me in that class and ends up sitting across from me instead, trying to put as much distance between us as possible, I just let it go because at this point I'm starting to get annoyed myself as I don't know what is even going on. The next hour we are in together she has to sit next to me, but she really tries to work around not having a genuine conversation with me, but then she starts going on about how I'm good at these games we played, I'm a bit fed up so I turn to her and I say \"let's talk privately later\" and I just get a big no from her. Later throughout the day I just try to piece together what could have happened but no luck. At the end of the school day I'm going to our locker to change my stuff out because I have sports practice after school and as I go to shut the locker, she just says leave it open. I had a feeling she was going to move out of the locker. So I go change and come back to put my clothes and away and guess what she's doing? She's moved all her stuff out. I then look at her and ask what's going on and she just tells me to get to practice. I say I want to know and she says I'm tired of it, go to practice. I just walked away after that. \n\nThis is not the first time stuff like this has happened between us before. She did this in the beginning of the school year also and last year too. She has never given me an honest answer as to why she keeps doing this to me or what I did wrong, she just decides to not talk to me whenever she feels like it.

I love learning/hearing about people's passions, and I like to think I lend a pretty good ear if you're going through some stuff. \n\nWhat I'm also down for is making friends. Online and irl are both A+ in my books (I live in the Greater Vancouver area, specifically Surrey, but if you're in the lower mainland in general we can make it work).\n\nOk so where to start;\nI'm 24 (turning 25 in a couple months), female, pansexual, and a giant goddamn nerd. Kind of dissatisfied with my life atm, working a dead end minimum wage job, mostly scraping by, dealing with a moderate cocktail of mental illness (mostly depression and anxiety), the few friends I do have are kind of moving on/put me on a lower priority than I put them, etc. I have a long term boyfriend who I love to bits; I will admit he has played a big part in keeping me sane, but my reliance on him as basically my only friend is minorly straining our relationship. \nMy interests include cats, fishkeeping (no tanks atm, apartment is sadly too small), all things cute, Dungeons and Dragons, drawing (I'm an art school dropout), fantasy novels, and video games. I'm kind of into anime too, but my interest in it honestly depends on my mood, and I tend to spend a lot of time being critical about what I'm watching. \n\nMy biggest thing is video games, so if you're into games and won't flame me for being bad we'll probably get along.\nI play games on PC, Switch, 3DS, and PS4. I'm into the classics too, but most of my time is devoted to the above. \nGames I play are mostly:\nLeague of Legends (rank s3, I like to think I'm better than that but honestly who knows), Pokemon, Legend of Zelda, Kingdom Hearts, Smash Bros, Diablo 3 (PS4)(I just started playing tho so I'm terrible lmao), Splatoon 2, Guild Wars 2 (desperately wanting someone to play this with), Final Fantasy\n\nAlso kinda random but I am fat/plus size/chunky/what have you, I'd love to get to know people who are of a similar body type so I have someone to rant about my experiences to who gets it haha. However please feel free to still talk to me if you're thinner too! As long as you aren't the type of person who makes fat jokes/hates fat people etc.\n\nI'd like to stress that I am only looking for friendship, so if you're trying to find a girlfriend you aren't gonna find her here. Also please don't message me if you're right wing/centrist/antiSJW/etc, our political views do not match up and its just not gonna work out. \n\nAaaaaaaaand yeah I think that's about it? I might add stuff if I think of anything and can figure out how to edit posts lol.\nThanks for reading my wall of text, I hope to hear from some of you! \n\nTL;DR - I would love to make friends or have gaming buddies, but I also want to hear you rant about anything that's on your mind, hmu", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Lately I\u2019ve noticed that her behavior towards me has changed. On my 22 bday I planned to go clubbing. 20 minutes before I arrived at her house, she sends me a text saying that she isn\u2019t feeling well and is unsure if she could go out. I felt disappointed but definitely wasn\u2019t mad at my friend for something that was out of her control. I decided we could just chill at her place and plan to go out the next week. When I arrived at her place there was no happy birthday, no card, no nothing. I\u2019m not a materialistic person but she\u2019s someone who claims how she is such a good gift giver. I would also at the very least write a card for my friends bday. To me that\u2019s just rude. When we were sitting in the living room I overhear her mom mention that she has been sick all day. Apparently sallie was sick all day and didn\u2019t bother to mention until 20 minutes prior to going out. Another thing that has bugged me about this friendship is that the things we do always seem to be centered around her. I do blame myself for being a very passive and go with the flow person. I hate conflict and would rather just go along. We watch the shows she likes and always seem to center around her. She has also made odd jabs at me occasionally but I\u2019m not sure if it was just in a joking way. Sallie rarely parties but seems to brag about how much alcohol she can drink. I\u2019m not an Alcohol person, I actually prefer to smoke weed. She\u2019s made comments about how I can\u2019t hold my liquor ( I\u2019m only 95 lbs mind you) and how she has to watch after me etc etc. She always offers me drinks when I\u2019m over but won\u2019t try to sit and smoke a blunt with me. I don\u2019t push it though, because I wouldn\u2019t ever push drugs or alcohol on anyone.  The next dilemma is that now it\u2019s her bday. She made a comment about how she\u2019s afraid her other friend won\u2019t show because she bailed last time. The thing is, I\u2019m actually sick and have been for a few days now. I went out of my way to buy her a gift. Should I even bother to go to her bday? Am I overreacting about sallie?\n\nWhat also ticks me off is how she never gives a shit about my situation. I come from a poorer family and have basically been on my own for a while now. She lives at home in a nice area, pays no bills, and goes to school. We went out one day to LA and I offered to drive when she asked if I had ever driven long distances. I had been getting up super early every morning to drive to my job in La! I had mentioned that to her several times and how I was tired of driving an hour an half to LA everyday. I had been with that job for months! A few months ago,  my car was broken into along with me dealing with serious family problems. When I saw her, she didn\u2019t even recall that I had my car broken into, despite me texting her about it the week before. Yet, when she was feeling depressed one day,  I went out and bought her a gift and went over. She always comments  on how she\u2019s \u201cadulting\u201d which means her going to the doctor alone without her mom. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s intending to be insulting, but I do feel turned off when someone complains about petty problems and brags about \u201cadulting\u201d . She also now complains about getting up early now that she works. She says how tired she is. She works about only 10 min away from her mom\u2019s house. I stopped reaching out to her ;yet, she still reaches out and makes plans to hang out. When we do, it\u2019s the same. I don\u2019t get why this person even bothers to reach out to me and then in turn treats me like a shadow. TL;DR my friend might be selfish and seems to ignore my needs.

Looking for someone to talk to, maybe help distract me from all the depressing garbage I've been pumping into my brain recently. A light in the darkness, so to speak. A few things about me, so you can judge whether you want to while away some time together. \n\nMost of my free time is spent playing games on my computer. Mostly simulation or management games like Farm Sim, Transport Fever or Rimworld. My free time has been cut into a bit though, since I have had to spend more time tending to my grandma since she decided to stop driving. I dont usually exercise, but I have taken a step to change that by buying an under desk elliptical, so I can burn some calories while I game. I've also started investing in the stock market, which I can totally nerd out about with you about what little I have learned so far!\n\nA few bad habits of mine are that I tend to jump around from hobby to hobby as I get inspired, and I end up learning a lot... but usually just enough to get me into trouble. I've been told that I can be abrasive at times, which I recognize, and that I can sound condescending at times without really meaning to. Sorry in advance for those things.\n\nA few things that could turn me off about you or cause incompatibility. While I do have my vice of drink (I'll have a drink or two before bed during the week) I don't really want to deal with someone that does drugs. I'm a bit of a 'Murica type, so if  that counts as a negative to you, then we may not get along very well. We all have to vent from time to time, I know I definitely do, but if you are someone that can't help but complain all the time and refuse advice, then I would prefer not to spend too much time with you.\n\nAnyhoo, I think that's a decent enough starting point. I am at work right now, but shouldn't be too busy tonight. We can chat here, but I do prefer to hangout on discord, since I'm always on there unless I'm sleeping or super busy with something! Hope to talk to you soon!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

It feels as if I'm easy to like, hard to hate, and harder to love. It may seem nice and cool and stuff that everyone likes me, but no one likes me enough to think of me too often. Having a lack of love and care from others just makes me feel empty inside. I just got out of a really depressive phase, I am trying to work towards self love and positivity. Before, I would just tell people that my day wasn't going very well or that I hated life and myself. Now, I am starting to see the positivity. But at 18, I think it's too late.\n\nI am a college student, so there are some casual things and some more serious things. For things like going to get food or play soccer, people are more than happy to join me or have me over. But when it comes to things like going on a trip or choosing suite mates for the next year, I am always excluded. Sometimes I feel like I am forcing my way into people's lives, but I cannot just leave them. After all, they do like me, just maybe not as much as I do. (I know how it feels to be hated by people and this isn't the same.) I've hardly been invited out or to parties with anyone. Maybe it's cause they don't want me to spend money on going with them? Maybe they think it'll not be as much value going with someone who isn't a best friend? I don't know. Probably something to do with the money. Cause I'm always welcome for food or soccer (which are free) but not for anything that requires me to spend. I know it's saving me money, but I'd rather spend a bit and have a good time.\n\nAnother way I notice this is through Instagram. People only comment on posts if it's their closest friends. My acquaintance/friend circle does not have any queen bees or anyone who will get a lot of comments from random people. It's just your friends. And you guessed it, I always get zero comments. Nought, zilch, nada. I have enough followers and likes to know that I don't post bad pics, and people want to follow me and know what's up. But it's like having more than 250 acquaintances and no real friends, when you have 250 likes and zero comments.\n\nI can't help but watch in pain and jealousy when two people hug, or say things like \"I missed you bro\" or \"love you, have a great day\" in public. No one has ever done that to me. I get a lot of smiles from people who recognize me, but no one bothers to come up to me and even have a word, let alone say they missed me. Hardly anyone has asked me how my break had been, or how my finals went, without me asking first.\n\nI want to know your experiences if you've been through it. Did it get better? If it did, how? If it didn't, how did you go about it?\n\nP. S. if anyone needs a friend or just someone to talk to, do drop a comment or leave a PM. I watch Riverdale and Impractical Jokers and I play soccer!\n\nP. P. S. If you have watched the movie Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, I am kinda like how Greg is at the start.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Thank you for understanding :)\n\n_____________\n\nHello! I've posted before and met a couple people, but ultimately those experiences were not what I'm looking for.\n\nReally, I'm a very average, sociable guy. I have no trouble making friends, but it's hard to find the right people when most of your friends these days are through work. I had a best friend for a good 15 years, but he moved and we both got busy and now we really don't speak. I don't come with any real baggage, I don't need a shoulder to cry on, and I'm a very solid and reliable person.\n\nBefore you message me, I'll outline a few things about myself and what I'm looking for.\n\n(*Note: I'm really not a picky person by nature, but for something such as this, I want to be clear and up front about everything so that nobody wastes their time*)\n\n_______________________________\n\n**A few general things**\n\n- I'm a 29-year-old male\n\n- College educated, finishing my BSN this year, already have my ADN and various certifications\n\n- I work in healthcare at a large trauma center hospital as an RN\n\n- I'm not prone to drama; very laid back about life but passionate in my interests\n\n- I live in the SW Chicago suburbs. I have a good car, but I'd still like to meet someone within a reasonable distance, as having to commute just to hang out is a pain and takes a significant time investment. If you're more than 20 miles or so from, say, Joliet, IL (not where I live, but it's kind of in the area), then we will have to really hit it off.\n\n- I'm happily married with no kids (yet)\n\n- I have a cat\n\n- I quit smoking about 8 years ago, but I still vape casually. I drink socially. I love dark and craft beers. I like red wine, bourbon and spiced rum. Not big on vodka, but I'll drink it if it's being passed around. I don't smoke pot, but it's fine if you do as long as you're not the type of person that's crafted your entire identity around it. I'm not a fan of other drugs and I won't try them.\n\n- I can hold my own in a political discussion, but it's not my cup of tea. I don't consider myself a liberal or a conservative. I have opinions on both sides of the aisle and, really, I think the two parties are unconstitutional and that the office of the presidency has too much power. I'm not a Trump fan and I wasn't a Hillary fan, either. Glad we got this out of the way.\n\n- I'm not religious. I don't consider myself an atheist, I just don't care and I'm more enthralled with conversations about the possibilities of life elsewhere in the universe. Let's talk about that instead.\n\n- I don't do sports and I don't watch them. My family were never really into sports when I was growing up, and my friends growing up weren't big into it, so I just never got a taste for it. Oh well.\n\n________________________________\n\n**A few of my hobbies and interests**\n\n- History. I love history. I'm definitely looking for a history nerd. Someone I can have a conversation with that doesn't go one way. I'm actually writing a historical nonfiction book in my spare time, and I hope to publish it this year (after almost 4 years of intermittent researching).\n\n- Hiking/Thru-hiking/Camping/Bushcrafting. I have access to a lot of land that belongs to my family in Southern Illinois and I try to make it down there about once a month for outdoor activities. There's a cabin, lots of hiking, and I've been slowly building a bushcraft camp out in the woods. It's awesome and I'm very lucky to have that.\n\n- Fitness. I recently dropped the traditional gym for CrossFit. I don't have a cult mentality about it, it's just a way for me to stay in shape. I'm not going to try to get you to do CrossFit with me, don't worry. I also enjoy running, and I'll be doing a lot of Obstacle Course Races this year.\n\n- Gaming. I love board games and card games. I love strategy games. I'm always down for a game night. I used to be a big video gamer, but not so much these days. I still play if the mood strikes me, but I'm more casual about it than I used to be. I have a PS4, Wii U, Nintendo Switch, PC (very outdated; hoping to build a new one this year), PS2, Nintendo 64, PSP, PS Vita, and various GameBoy variants. My traditional favorite franchises include Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid, Super Smash Bros., Civilization, Dead Space, Mass Effect, etc. I've also been a huge fan of Sins of a Solar Empire since it came out. I'm always down for some Sins if you're a PC gamer.\n\n- Films. I've been slowly mutating into something of a film snob. I love foreign films, especially South Korean and French. I can get really passionate about this, and I love introducing people to hidden gems and cult classics.\n\n- More traditional games like Chess and Poker. I'm not very good at them, but I love them and I do enjoy some respectful competition.\n\n- Books in general, not just history. I'm an avid reader, and when I publish my book, I'll be taking a break from history for a long while to jump back into science fiction, fantasy, general fiction and the classics.\n\n- Podcasts. I'm not very involved with music anymore, and I'm more often than not listening to a podcast (or audiobook). Some of my favorites include: Dan Carlin's Hardcore History, Historium, Lore, Casefile, Intelligence Squared, No Such Thing as a Fish, Sawbones, and several more.\n\n- Recreational shooting. Firearms are a very new hobby for me. Late last year I got my hands on my FOID card and first two firearms. I'm looking to get perhaps 2 or 3 more this year. I don't have any stirring reasons for taking up firearms, I just thing they're a lot of (responsible) fun and I find it to be an enjoyable hobby.\n\n____________________________________\n\n**So what am I looking for?**\n\nA best friend. Someone I can be on the same level with. Gender doesn't matter. I don't care if you're gay or straight. Age should be reasonably comparable (perhaps 21-35, but I can bend on this; must be over 18, though, no exceptions). Someone that has their life together and wants to get together for a drink and a meal at a brewery, or a coffee and great conversation. Someone I can have over for game nights and share inside jokes. Take a road trip for camping or adventure. Take day trips up to the city and spend too much money. Play some strategy games with. Talk about books. Gush about some old film or argue about whether or not the Byzantines were real Romans. Go on a run or check out rock climbing (which I suck at). Build something. Go to a gun range. Paint, write, whatever. Let's get a drink. Play Viking Chess with me. Let's hit up a comic store.\n\n____________________________________\n\nIn more ways than one, my wife is my best friend, but I'm used to having that connection outside of my marriage as well as in. Finding that second connection again is my goal.\n\nJust in case it helps to make this long shot a little less long, [here is a photo of me](https://i.imgur.com/kDovE22.jpg).\n\nSorry that this was so long-winded, but thanks for reading if you've made it this far. Respond here or shoot me a PM if you're interested and if you think we'd mesh well based on what you've read. This is an alt account, but I try to check it regularly. Cheers.\n\n____________________________________\n\n**Edit:**\n\nIf you want to kick things off with an easy ice-breaker, I'll throw you a bone: you can just sent me answers to some of the following questions. Totally optional.\n\n- ASL\n\n- What are your hobbies and interests?\n\n- What do you do for fun?\n\n- What do you do for a living?\n\n- What's your ideal friend-date if we meet up?\n\n- What's your favorite movie or game?\n\n- What's your favorite period, event or figure from history?", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Yay.\n\nIn any case, here is some basic info about me, as I still am trying to learn the art of being concise:\n\n- A nineteen year old dude of Russian origin residing in Canada - I speak both English and Russian fluently.\n\n- Going to College for a Law Enforcement program with plans to go to Uni for Criminology after I graduate.\n\n- Despite the number of stereotypes associated with the aforementioned career, I have a firm left lean when it comes to politics.\n\n- I have a certain amount of anxiety and depression, which I am dealing with as best as I can - although recently, things have been on the mend - enough so that the worst issue I have to deal with on the day to day basis is... crippling boredom. \n\n- INTP/\u201cLogician\u201d personality on Myers-Briggs test. I also like to know things. As such, expect a barrage of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and so on. I love it when other people ask questions, too. \n\n- Atheist. My \u2018religion\u2019 is *very* important to me :^) While I dabble in Nordic paganism and the like, it is for shits and giggles.\n\n- Living with my parents for financial convenience - yay! :D\n\n- I do not smoke, am a social drinker and I do not do pot - in fact, I am somewhat stigmatized against the latter by a some life experiences and my chosen career. I am also yet to meet a pot smoker who was not in fact a stereotype. Kind of weird. Maybe the non-stereotypes.. I dunno, don\u2019t come covered in half a dozen different pieces of cannabis-themed merchandize and act like complete selfish assholes? Who\u2019d have guessed. \n\n- Gainfully *un*employed, since I managed to save up a bit of money and would rather focus on my classes than balance them and work.\n\n\nMore detailed / \u2018interesting\u2019 / specific info about yours truly:\n- I am a massive nerd. Video games are probably the love of my life, with about a dozen games on my favourite list, including but not limited to - Dark Souls series, NieR: Auromata, WoW, DOOM, Bioshock, Mass Effect and Sunless Sea. Honestly, for whataver reason, I never really had any friends who played any of the same games as I. As such, the odds are I would love to play something, even if it means I have to buy a new game - after all, gaming is a grand experience to bond over! (I have PC &amp; PS4)\n\nFinally got around to playing the original Nier, which was a pain in the ass to get my hands on.. but so worth it. I am pretty speechless from how fucking good it is.  \n\n- I love shows like the Simpsons, Futurama, early South Park and most recently - Disenchanted. Massive sucker for anything Studio Ghibli. Favorite series of all time would be the \u201cWire\u201d (come on. I want to be a cop, what else did you expect?), and I really want to watch Hannibal and Breaking Bad at some point. Watching 'Lewis', a (yet another) British detective show. \n\n- Super into D&amp;D-esque roleplaying games - although have not been playing anything that I\u2019ve enjoyed for a long while now.\n\n- I love reading, although I do not have much time for it recently - two favorite books would be 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic. \n\n- Creepy shit. If you dig Lovecraft and SCP Foundation, I am your boi. I am not a fan of most horror movies and video games, as I loath cheap jumpscares they are so enamored with. Psychological / surreal shit is the best. \n\n- My sense of humor is possibly the worst, and I have dank memes ready for every possible situation and I just love offensive / politically incorrect / plain juvenile humor. \n\n- Super into airsoft at the moment - spent -way- too much money on getting my kit together, but at least I seem to finally getting into the swing of things: went to play couple weeks ago, and not only did I get my first non-melee kill, but I got to use my new sidearm! I also broke a buddy\u2019s handguard (turns out, my mil-spec bipod was tougher than random plastic out of which the former was made) and some dick shot my flashlight\u2019s lens out. I also got a cold from laying on the floor too much.\nAll in all, let\u2019s call it a sucess! :D\n\n- I listen to music pretty much 24/7. I think it is time to give up trying to categorize what I like by genre, and instead do it by what I *don\u2019t* like - which basically boils down to anything mainstream culture, like rap and pop (the only two exceptions to the former being Gorillaz and Die Antwoord) I would love me some new music, so feel free to send some my way for a trade! \n[Here is *my* Christmas carol for 2018.](\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TBpNtmanZ1Y)\n\n- Honestly, I just love learning stuff, from history to (most recently) philosophy and sociology, since these fields are quite pertinent to more than a few classes I am taking.\n\n- I also like doggos and sneks. Bork. Pls send pupper / danger noodle pics. \n\n- If I was to go to Hogwarts, I'd be a Slytherin 200%! \n\nI hate to say this, but I feel the need to: **if you do not put little to no effort into your message, I will not bother replying. That goes for stuff like lack of grammar and improper punctuation to short and generic. I am not asking you to write a wall like I just did, but please tell me -something- about yourself or -something- that catches my attention. And no, \u201chey, do you wanna chat?\u201d does not cut it.**\nLife\u2019s too short, and I am already sick of bullshit.\n\nI prefer using Discord over anything else, but I like to get to know people on here before jumping in there. Please no Reddit Chats, I hate the UI. \n\nFeel free to hit me with your favorite ice breaker! (As long as it is not a Trotsky ice pick). \n\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I'm typically a lonely and depressed person. I don't have many friends to hangout with or talk to, nor friends in general. I suffer from anxiety and depression. It effects me a lot on day to day basis. Some days I'm fine Some I'm not. \n\nIn terms of my personality I'm funny/sarcastic, smart, talkative, honest, and always have interesting stuff to talk about lol. I can also be weird so yeah. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, Star Wars, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Game of Thrones, The Handmaid's Tale, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. \n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. I love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). I enjoy learning about history/political science in school. I also read comic books and watch WWE. \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03.

Important please don't message me and then ghost me soon after it hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Don't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have kik, discord, and Snapchat but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now.

{"post_id": "agcu26", "created_utc": 1547583767, "title": "Selfish friend? Or am I overreacting?", "author": "earofvangogh6", "self_text": "I\u2019ve been friends with a girl (let\u2019s call her sallie ) for about 7 years. Lately I\u2019ve noticed that her behavior towards me has changed. On my 22 bday I planned to go clubbing. 20 minutes before I arrived at her house, she sends me a text saying that she isn\u2019t feeling well and is unsure if she could go out. I felt disappointed but definitely wasn\u2019t mad at my friend for something that was out of her control. I decided we could just chill at her place and plan to go out the next week. When I arrived at her place there was no happy birthday, no card, no nothing. I\u2019m not a materialistic person but she\u2019s someone who claims how she is such a good gift giver. I would also at the very least write a card for my friends bday. To me that\u2019s just rude. When we were sitting in the living room I overhear her mom mention that she has been sick all day. Apparently sallie was sick all day and didn\u2019t bother to mention until 20 minutes prior to going out. Another thing that has bugged me about this friendship is that the things we do always seem to be centered around her. I do blame myself for being a very passive and go with the flow person. I hate conflict and would rather just go along. We watch the shows she likes and always seem to center around her. She has also made odd jabs at me occasionally but I\u2019m not sure if it was just in a joking way. Sallie rarely parties but seems to brag about how much alcohol she can drink. I\u2019m not an Alcohol person, I actually prefer to smoke weed. She\u2019s made comments about how I can\u2019t hold my liquor ( I\u2019m only 95 lbs mind you) and how she has to watch after me etc etc. She always offers me drinks when I\u2019m over but won\u2019t try to sit and smoke a blunt with me. I don\u2019t push it though, because I wouldn\u2019t ever push drugs or alcohol on anyone.  The next dilemma is that now it\u2019s her bday. She made a comment about how she\u2019s afraid her other friend won\u2019t show because she bailed last time. The thing is, I\u2019m actually sick and have been for a few days now. I went out of my way to buy her a gift. Should I even bother to go to her bday? Am I overreacting about sallie?\n\nWhat also ticks me off is how she never gives a shit about my situation. I come from a poorer family and have basically been on my own for a while now. She lives at home in a nice area, pays no bills, and goes to school. We went out one day to LA and I offered to drive when she asked if I had ever driven long distances. I had been getting up super early every morning to drive to my job in La! I had mentioned that to her several times and how I was tired of driving an hour an half to LA everyday. I had been with that job for months! A few months ago,  my car was broken into along with me dealing with serious family problems. When I saw her, she didn\u2019t even recall that I had my car broken into, despite me texting her about it the week before. Yet, when she was feeling depressed one day,  I went out and bought her a gift and went over. She always comments  on how she\u2019s \u201cadulting\u201d which means her going to the doctor alone without her mom. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s intending to be insulting, but I do feel turned off when someone complains about petty problems and brags about \u201cadulting\u201d . She also now complains about getting up early now that she works. She says how tired she is. She works about only 10 min away from her mom\u2019s house. I stopped reaching out to her ;yet, she still reaches out and makes plans to hang out. When we do, it\u2019s the same. I don\u2019t get why this person even bothers to reach out to me and then in turn treats me like a shadow. TL;DR my friend might be selfish and seems to ignore my needs. ", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I have trust issues, but he really started to convince me he actually liked me. Eventually we slept together, then he starts getting a bit distant.

I was going to move to his city and we talked about being together, but something beyond my control came up and moving there got delayed. In the mean time, he was on tinder sleeping around a bit. I don't care that much if it's just sex, but I didn't sleep with anyone else. Then he meets a girl and really likes her. He lied to her saying I was just a friend and nothing ever happened. Total revisionist history. They became \"official\" so I told him obviously I am upset, we haven't really been \"just friends\" and I need space. He now has decided he doesn't even want to be friends with me because it wouldn't be fair and he's anxious I'll tell the new girl that he and I were more than friends. That's really all he cares about. Not the loss of our friendship or relationship, just that I might cause drama for his great shiny new life so I have to go. \n\nI just don't get why he would go through the months and months of effort to convince me I could trust him and that he really liked me when it was obviously lies since he moved on so easily and doesn't even want me in his life as a friend.

Someone with an ideal they were willing to strive for; a part of themself they held-firm for someone special. Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of option, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person.\n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers).\n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values).\n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

I'm kind of a loner and dont have very many friends. I became part of a Clone Hero twitch community as I was interested at the time and I met a girl who instantly clicked with me. Both loners, not very many friends, depressed, into metal and video games. This was about a year ago and just recently shes gotten back into college and started dating. I was super happy for her because she was finally coming out of her shell. Long story short, we would butt heads from time to time as I would explain that she stopped talking to me as much and stopped making plans to play Overwatch. (She lives in the UK, me in the US). Her new boyfriend decided to message me and call me a pedophile as our age difference is a little wide, me being 30 and her being 18 but there was never anything sexual about our friendship. She didnt stick up for me and we didn't talk for about a week to let everything blow over. We decided to leave the past as is and work on things which were going real well. She'd make plans with me and follow through with them. Her boyfriend ended up buying a gaming PC to play with her, which is fine. About a week ago he played with us and I felt like a third wheel. They were chatting about stuff going on with their friend group and not saying much to me. I told her later that I would appreciate it if he didn't play with us on our days that we would make plans, which was once a week. Last night was one if those days, I hop on, she hops on, and then her boyfriend hops on. I asked her if she invited him to play and if so then we could just reschedule. She sent him a message saying that it was just going to be me and her since we had plans to catch up on our week. He messages me asking if I had a problem with him, which I didn't, and why I wouldn't just play with them and I explained to him about how I dont enjoy feeling like a third wheel in their relationship. He then blows up, calling me childish and possessive and storms offline which makes her anxiety that much worse. Today roles around and I get a long message from her saying I'm possessive, words shes never used before until her boyfriend called me it last night, and that I need to apologize to him or shes dropping this friendship completely. I don't feel like I was in the wrong but I could be being biased. Just need some kind of support or help as she was my best friend.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

As the title implies, I\u2019m a little clueless on how to make good, long-lasting friendships. I\u2019ve had to move away from my really old friends, and now four and a half years later, we never talk (and frankly with many of them I\u2019ve changed so much that I want to keep it that way, and the feeling is apparently mutual). I made a few friends in middle school, but now that I\u2019m a high school junior, I only have one close-ish friend, and I talk to one other girl in a group chat with my friend. I really miss one of my old friends from before the move, but don\u2019t know how to reach her. I also miss an old friend from middle school, but she lives pretty far away and is too busy to have long conversations. I\u2019ve had a couple toxic friendships in high school that got broken off recently. Other than that, I just hang out with my mom and brother, or banter with teachers. I\u2019m so incredibly lonely, and I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll lose my friend and never have another (and definitely never date anyone! I\u2019d be lucky if I got a date). I\u2019m very protective of alone time and very easily annoyed, and I know these are barriers in maintaining my friendship. But I\u2019m so desperately lonely, I\u2019d be willing to do almost anything to have another close friend I\u2019d see every day (I only see my friend a couple times a month, if that). How might I make another friend or strengthen my current friendship? Because being this lonely is hard. I can cope most days, but then some days I feel like crying because I just feel so alone and I don\u2019t know how to fix this, and then I beat myself up over it (which worries me because that\u2019s what I used to do when I was very depressed).

I was / am her mentor, and we are the same age (29). We clicked pretty well (she would literally hang out in my office for hours almost every day) and we became good friends. Up until recently we hung out fairly regularly after work as well, went to bars, events, etc.\n\nRight before Christmas my partner (we are married) was accepted to a graduate school in a nearby city (2 hours away) so I put in for a transfer to the branch office we have in that city. Before the announcement was made, I texted my friend and told her about my transfer because she had previously mentioned that she also wanted to transfer to that city because it is her home town and she really hates/dislikes the current city she is in. I didn\u2019t want her to think I was trying to stab her in the back or be clandestine about moving, so I told her even though I could have asked my boss to not announce it at all. \n\nShe blew up, said I knew she wanted to transfer there in about 6 months, that my request will ruin her chances at getting a transfer, and basically said that I betrayed her. She hasn\u2019t said a word to me in almost a month, which is incredibly awkward because we are co workers and the nature of our works requires a lot of office communication. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to be nice and give her some space. I still greet her in a friendly way each morning, and I invite her out on office lunches. She always declines now (she has never declined in the past). In contrast, she will go out of her way to avoid eye contact with me, talk/greet me (pretty much everyone in the office tells everyone hello in the morning), and she even has conversations with people who are in my office, but she will keep the door almost shut so I can\u2019t see her while she is speaking. I also found out that she put in a transfer request almost immediately after I did. \n\nHonestly, at this point I\u2019m more annoyed than anything else because I feel like she is acting like a child. Nevertheless, I don\u2019t like conflict and I would like to have a functional work relationship with her, especially if we both get transferred. \n\nWhat do you guys think?

We started casually talking out of mutual interest and at some point we talked about more personal things in between and became very good friends. We skyped each other and talked for hours and we kept saying that we should do it again but whenever I got some free time for that she's apologize and say she as busy (nothing wrong with that, I understand completely) but she never brought it up herself so I stopped talking about it. \n\nBack in November we were both pretty busy but I still checked my messages everyday and she hardly ever replied to me. I felt really bad but I focused on my things. When se was back we went to talking but we've been on an off for a while. She has lost interest in that mutual subject we had, she apologized about that a lot but consequently we don't talk as much. \n\nRecently she also told me she believes to be suffering from mental illness which would explain how she feels and she said she'd look into it. \n\nSince she hasn't messaged me much but I thought it was fine and just her being busy, taking time for herself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday something funny happened that would have interested her so I messaged her and she replied right away, chatting for a while and not replying anymore.

Beyond those girls, the only friends I have are my husband, SIL, and her boyfriend. While those three are great, I really want to have some girl friends not connected to me via marriage. 1 of the four is a friend I have had since kindergarten (F1), 1 since late high school (F2), and 2 I have become friends with since leaving high school (F3 and F4). F1 and F2 were co maids of honor for my wedding (August 2017), and after agreeing excitably to the role proceeded to not plan anything (Shower, bachelorette party, etc) or really show much interest or excitement. F3 was a bridesmaid in the wedding and picked up their slack (planning a shower with me last minute and a bachelorette days before). This was discouraging but I forgave them and got over it, I wouldn\u2019t even bring it up but I think it may provide context to the situation. \n\nI am also the only one of my friends who is married and the only one who completed a college degree, we are all ages 21-24. It\u2019s no big deal to me and I support their choices, but sometimes I wonder if this distance they are giving me has something to do with it since it has increased in the past two years. (Married 8/17, graduated 5/18). I still have been working shift work like them and am happy to go out and do things, I don\u2019t feel like either of those have changed me.\n\nIt is now halfway through January, and the last I heard from any of them was Christmas, and it was just a Merry Christmas message from F1. I haven\u2019t spent time with any of them since a lunch with F2 at the beginning of November. I look through my text message history and they are all my messages to them trying to get together, and their messages back either planning something then bailing, saying they are too busy right now, or that they will get back to me with when they are available but never got back. \n\nI\u2019ve started to get depressed over the fact that I can\u2019t seem to maintain a simple friendship. First I tried to say it was just busy lives and partially me, but this has been going on for more than a year and I\u2019m sick of being the only one who reaches out. There\u2019s so many things that have just made me feel I don\u2019t matter to them. Ex: F1 announced her pregnancy on Facebook 3 months after being in my wedding without mentioning one thing to me, before or after. After trying at the end of November to make plans with each of them and getting nothing or non committal responses back, I\u2019ve stopped reaching out. \n\nMy husband says I should just message them, but I am starting to feel it may be time to move on. I have told them I was getting mildly depressed by not doing anything social outside of work and they clearly haven\u2019t tried to change that despite my efforts to spend time with them. All I can think about it is what I have done to make them not want to spend time with me anymore, and it makes me doubt whether they ever really cared in the first place. I care for each of them dearly and I want the best for them and to spend time with them, but how much effort should I really keep putting in if I get nothing in return? \n\nIt\u2019s really hurt my confidence for trying to make new friends because now I\u2019m constantly questioning if I make interesting enough conversation or if I do weird things that make them uncomfortable or something. I don\u2019t know if I should keep trying to make these friendships work, confront them with how I\u2019m feeling, or just kind of move on and try to make new friends. Any advice is very appreciated.

I have two German Shepherds. Its my goal to have 4-5 big dogs some day (I also have 3 cats)\n\n \u2022 I love talking to people about thier live goals and passions. You can never talk to much about yourself\n\n \u2022 I like cars! Honestly its an obsession at this point.\n\n \u2022 I casually play video games. I tend to buy games then never play them. I have 23ish steam games but playes maybe 50 of them. I also have games like overwatch and a bunch of games on Xbox.\n\n \u2022 I tend to ramble about pointless things and get lost in my own thought.\n\n \u2022 I dont judge. Im very unbiased and try to keep my personal feelings out of things.\n\n \u2022 Music! I tend to listen to pop punk and alternative. Blink-182 and Brand new are tied for my favorite band.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nSooo yeah I think I have a decent sense of humor. I like to laugh joke around. Maybe we can play a game or something? Idk. I'm just rambling at this point because I don't know how to close this...\n\nLooking for people around my age (17-22) would be ideal but not required. Male or female, doesn't matter. Just looking for a friend :) I have Snapchat, discord (I prefer Discord) Kik, Reddit if you really just want to talk here.\n\nPm me a bit about yourself. Please no \"hey let's chat\" without introducing yourself.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Can it ever recover?", "author": "littlepinkbowie", "self_text": "This is quite a long story so, strap in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy (ex)friend and I met when we were in our freshman year of high school, we didn't initially click (she thought I was annoying, I thought she was mean), but our friends were friends so we tolerated one another. By our senior year, we got closer, and would hang out more often and would end up becoming very close. \n\nWhile we both went to different colleges, we stayed in constant contact.  We'd message each other every day, would call and face time one another and would party whenever we could. When I lived abroad for a year, she went out and visited and we became as close as sisters. \n\nBefore I graduated college, I met a guy and I moved out to another state be with him. I still stayed in contact with my friend, she even came out and visited us. After being out of state for a few years, we moved back to my home state; my boyfriend, me and my \"best friend\" all moved in together. Initially, it was great. We all had a lot of fun, we partied together, got a long (we did have quips, but it always got resolved quickly). At this point, I was working at a start up and she was working at a massive company as a contractor, with the expectation she was going to get converted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen everything started to unravel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend didn't get converted, and had to take a job that she wasn't good at and drove her into a deep depression. I ended up getting a new, great job in the field I wanted. She started to spin into a depression, while I was soaring high. To top it off, the people she worked at for her new job were hardline \"kill all men\" feminist lesbians, who turned her into a man hating drone. And she started to take it out on my boyfriend. She'd say things like, \"All men are rapists\" and would belittle him for just being a guy. It drove him into a depression and he would avoid her if he could. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I tried to help her get therapy, we would help for three months to try and get her a new job. But she just kept getting worse and worse. She'd come home from work, and would hide in her room. I even tried to set her up with a mutual guy friend, and when he told her he wasn't interested, she blamed me - \"How could you get my hopes up? Did you sabotage me? Are you jealous??\". Her actions started to impact the relationship with my boyfriend and I, and we started fighting. We knew she was going through depression, so we went easy on her and walked around her on egg shells. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was then we realized she needed to move out, there was no her getting better. We helped her get a job (I lied, and I had a family member lie as a reference to just get her the hell out) and she ended up getting it. It was a good job, and it got us free. While she was moving out, we went AT one another. Screaming and yelling. It was bad. She told me, she \"could never be friends with someone more successful than her\", as it made her feel bad about herself. She also begged me to kick my boyfriend out, so it could be her and me. She also begged me to go to joint therapy with her. I told her no.   \n\n\nAfter she moved out, I ended up finding out that she not only unfriended me on every social media platform, but she quit the job we got her so she could become a freelancer in the industry I was in. She'd never expressed interest in that industry before, but now that our friendship was splintered, she went for it. After talking with my therapist, she was clear to point out that my \"ex best friend\" was trying to force me to chose between her and my boyfriend. And the fact that I picked my boyfriend destroyed our friendship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been about 4 months since she moved out, and while it hurt when it happened, I think about her less and less. The house became calmer and my relationship with my boyfriend immediately improved. We're happy, healthy and thriving. However, I still feel like a part of me is missing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it worth it for me to even salvage this relationship? She was a dear friend for 11 years, my best friend since High School, and I'm still hurt and feel awful about what happened. If I can't salvage this, how do I get over it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

It's about quality, not quantity. In theory a server with 5 people can be very active and fun.\n\n\\- be active, give feedback and put in some effort, especially in the beginning: When people join a server and they don't properly try to get to know each other, then the server just becomes white noise and will be forgotten after a while. Ask each other questions, take part in conversations and be open to joining voice chat and playing games with each other etc.\n\nWhat this server is for: Making friends, self improvement, mental health.\n\nI try to be open about my anxiety, not so much IRL, but when getting to know each other online. Mental health issues are very common and people should be more open about them. With the server I'd like people to be willing to listen and help each other. Obviously in serious cases, the server can't and shouldn't replace therapy.\n\nI suppose my approach to mental health is a bit different from others. Many see talking and dealing with these as a source of unnecessary negativity, while I see it as upmost important, fascinating and many times humorous. Mental health is part of our daily lives, when dealing with friends, family and our job. Everyone has room to improve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want this to be about forced positivity and self centered boasting. No one is boring. Getting to know each other can be awkward, difficult and time consuming. Many people don't just talk and click immediately.

So about two weeks ago, me and my girlfriend separated. It's been the hardest thing I've ever had to go through, but I'm slowly improving. It was a really amicable breakup and I have no hard feelings, just love and respect for her.\n\nNonetheless, I do feel sad, and often find myself lacking someone to chat to. I'd prefer chatting to girls I'll admit. You might then say \"Oh, well, Thanos_HandsofFate, why do you specifically seek girls?\" I specifically seek girls because the guy friends I have chatted to are utterly horrible at conversing about more emotionally intimate topics, nor having much to say about anything. That being said, if you're a guy who thinks he's in touch with his feminine side, don't hesitate to get in touch :)\n\nSo besides that sob story, a bit about me:\n\nI'm from an international background. What this means is that I originally come from Europe, but moved to North America, then back and forth a lot :) I love learning about different cultures and have traveled quite a bit!\n\nI'm a big fan of movies and television. I take it so seriously that I'll often need like the perfect conditions to watch something, or specific day times to see a TV episode. I treat it as an event. Favorite show: Buffy! Favorite Movie: Back to the Future\n\nI love gaming. It's mainly videogames that I play, but when the chance arises, I'm on boardgames very quickly too. For videogames, I think Witcher 3, God of War and Half Life 2 remain my favorites. Boardgames, I'm a big fan of Monopoly and Settlers of Catan!!\n\nI also enjoy talking psychology, philosophy, maybe a bit of etymology thrown in for good measure. Books, I'm trying to get more into, so if you have suggestions, go for it.\n\nFinally, I love music. Been playing piano since I was 6 and guitar since I was 14. Plenty of genres I enjoy listening to, playing and composing in :) right now I'm getting into jazz, but welcome discussion on anything really.\n\nI use sarcastic witticisms to make light of situations. I also played the clarinet once on a dare (didn't know where else to put this).\n\nIf you'd like to chat, maybe send me a message with your favorite movies! I do also enjoy sending voice messages on whatsapp, but am happy to converse via any platform you may wish to use :)\n\nBest, Thanos_HandsofFate\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Can someone be willing to be honest with themselves and their life and open up in a more real way?  Maybe share how our journeys in life have been in an open way. I don't mind if yours has been difficult. Mine has also been. I will be ready to listen to you and will never judge you, so I also hope I can find a non judemental person who is willing to listen to me as well. I know these common interests are the normal ways to connect to someone nowadays, and there is nothing wrong with them so I'm not saying that I don't ever want to talk about them, but just not all the time.  I don't mind talking about them sometimes since I also enjoy some stuff, and if we live close enough, I wouldn't mind going to watch movies with you. \n\nAlso, it would be nice to find an activity buddy. If you live in NJ/ NY area this will make things easier. I am open to a few internet friends in other parts of the world but only if I thought it could work. I do prefer real life friends though.\n\nI would like to hang out with someone who can respect someone who can be quiet at times. I can write a lot, but in person I am the opposite. I am a pleasant person but if you are talkative, it makes things easier. Also, I look young for my age.  I can't do too much about it so I would love it if you are mature and don't stare at me as if you are greatly confused or disgusted by the fact I look young for my age. Just learn to get over it, and I will try my best to be a good friend that will support you when you are feeling down and be there for you.  Just don't be picky and expect me to have listened to every song you like, have watched every movie you love, and to get that obscure reference from some show. I don't mind you sharing your favorite shows and stuff with me as long as you don't judge me for not having heard of it yet or have not gotten into it yet. I might just start getting into a few of your suggestions and we can bond over that eventually, but for now I'd like to meet real people who can connect with on a deeper way. \nThe only preference I have is your age range must be 23- 35 and please be a genuinely nice person.

It's nothing against you personally, but that it'll drag me down into my own negative ruminations and I'd prefer to avoid that.\n\nThank you for understanding! \u2665\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're interested, please leave a comment below or send me a PM!

He\u2019s changing and I think the only reason he still talks to me is to play video games together when his other friends are busy. When we hang out in person he seems disinterested, and often cancels or doesn't want to hang out at all. Usually my friend and I are the ones to propose something - usually some food place for an hour or two, then we all go home. He almost never offers unless it's after we suggest something. It's as if he looks forward more to the food than spending time with us and that any extra time spent with us is a hassle.\n\nBy contrast, when he\u2019s with his High School friends (we didn\u2019t go the same one) I see their snaps and he\u2019ll be out with them for hours doing stuff at each other\u2019s places, skateboarding, watching movies, meeting up in-between classes and overall going out much more often than we do, then when I ask about it, he\u2019ll lie saying he was babysitting or doing chores etc. He doesn't seem willing to spend time unless it\u2019s talking on Discord and playing PC games for a 3-4 hours every other day. Just today he invited them to his house for a party and didn\u2019t mention it to me. It\u2019s like I\u2019m only a game friend, and not a friend in a real sense. It hurts really fucking hard. It's a far cry from the \"We'll always be best friends!\" he used to tell me.\n\nWe had a falling out back in July over some serious depression I was having. He understandably left after trying for months to help me because my attitude just wasn't improving. After three months, he reapproached me on campus about how he \"kinda\" missed playing games with me and our friendship in general. We restarted it with a little more hanging out and overall talking more than before July. I apologized and he took some blame the situation despite me insisting it was all my fault.\n\nI cherish my friendship with him but I'm not sure to the extent it's reciprocated. It's obvious I'm not very important to him like before, but I hold out hope since we still talk a fair bit online and that maybe more time is needed to develop. At the same time, I feel like I should accept that \"people change\" and I personally don't know if he'd care much if I cut myself from his life. I've talked to him about this stuff before, but it really upsets him.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? How would you determine whether a friend is worth keeping?

In in bed crying right now.\nSo what hapoened was my best friend, A has abandoned me.\nMe and A have been friends for 5 years now and we just got eachother and got a long so well. She was my everything and we were even called inseparable. We would fight a lot but would without a doubt make up. We were happy with eachother until senior year of high school came. For the first semester I started noticing that she was becoming distant and distant. She was dealing with a lot of family issues and everything and didnt like talking about them. I tried to understand. I had over 10 conversations with her in real life talking about us growing distant. And it hurt me. I tried so hard. Even if she would reply and left me.on read I would go to her and talk. But recently she started saying bad stuff about my other best friend B to some other people that we are all friends with. She started drama and tried to make me turn against B. But I didnt care about that stuff I was hurt A told the other people what I told her about B. She betrayed my trust and when I confronted her about she gave me a half assed apology and said \"well u did this too\". She always brings up my past mistakes in life. How once 4 years ago I betrayed her trust (which was a totally different story and if u knew u wld agree with what I did).  She also always brings up how I was mean to her once in 9th grade and got annoyed listening to her family issues. I have apologized ever since then But she still says that she cant tell me. That she physically and emotionally cant. Even with all that crap I still tried to be there for her. However when what she did to B I told her \"we need a break\". I'm happy I took the iniative because I felt she was toxic for me? She kept bringing up my past mistakes and when I told her that it made me feel guilty and shitty she would say that she doesn't care and its not her fault. And the worse tjing is while she told me shes becoming distant from me and everyone because her mental health is getting worse she was out becoming closer friends with others but refusing to make an effort in our friendship.\nWhenever we fought I always had to go to her. I had to apologize. She just never really cared and when I would tell her this she wld say no she did and I just never noticed.\nThis is a really long post but I'm so heart broken. I am a person who is easily hurt and to know the person who was my best friend for life is someone who doesnt care about me hurts so much. \nI dont know I feel like was I always lied to then? Were the past 5 years a waste?\nEven now she isnt making any efforts and I just dont know.\nI want to move one and focus on myself but it hurts. I don't know even if we will ever make up and if she does apologize if i should even forgive her. We are going to be going to different colleges and we knew that. I just never thought we would break off so soon. We talked about eachothers marriages and everything.\nI feel so hurt and abused. I feel as if she emotionally abused me. Made me care more and make more effort when she made none. But at the same time I think I'm trapped. I think that she wldnt do such a thing shes my best friend for life she wldnt.and i do look back at all the tjings she did for me. But which were often times more materialistic.\nSomeone just please give me advice or just tell me somethig to help me understand. \nSo sorry this is a mess.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Then i lost my patience, and i ended up saying, \"i think i am disturbing you, i thought we are good friends but I think we are not, if you don't want to talk to me then tell me so i won't bother you again\", there was no reply from his side until after 2 hours He got angry and he responded \"you are talking nonsense\"... I was upset already his reply made me even more upset and i cried... and he didn't even tried to talk to me for 3 days.... And  I avoided him too. Today when we met i kept ignoring him. He got mad and started taunting me by saying \"someone i know is now someone i knew\". And i replied to him you don't care that is why I am doing this. \nActually the way he was responding to my messages that day we first fought because of that I was unable to tell him that I was not feeling well... \nToday our conversation started with a fight but then i told him everything why i was behaving like this. He said if he knew that i was feeling like that he must have not treated me that way he thought everything is fine. He also said he is feeling bad now and said sorry to me. Then when I asked him about that \"hmm\" reply for my pet... He said he didn't knew what to say he thought i am disturbed so he just ended up replying \"hmm\" he didn't meant to upset me. \nI am not sure to believe him or not especially for that \"hmm\" reply for my pet. i always ask him and my other frnds alwayz that how they are doing?.... I can't treat anyone like that the way he treated me that night, i can understand he didn't knew about i  was not okay but it's not just about that...

Yes, you hear right, I've **Palestinian** on my father's side and Dixie / AmericoGermanic (yes, I just made that word up) on my mother's side! Because of this, I speak both English and Arabic, as well as I've learned a bit of Spanish (I need a cover if they start hunting us Arabs, haha)! And I've both the Bonnie Blue (Dixie) and Palestinian flags in my room, so I'm sure that confuses a lot of people!\n\nI'm also a **super social person**, but oh God, I didn't used to be. When I was younger, I had 0 social desire. People would come over for playdates and we'd play for an hour, but then I'd go lock myself in my room and play what I called the alone game, haha.\n\nAnyways, the past is the past and I'd **simply adore talking with some new people!** Not that I really need it, but I figure what if my new favorite person messages me, I ought to at least put myself out there, right? That being said, let's get this started!\n\n* I've **never had a pen pal** (even though I've posted here once or twice), but I absolutely, possessively am in love with writing, so it would make me so happy to have a snail mail pen pal! I use exclusively fountain pens, so they should look relatively nice!\n* I am much more of an in-person type of person than I am one for online interactions, so if I don't get to send you audio, I might get stir crazy! Don't worry though, I've been told on many occasions **I've a nice voice**, so it shouldn't be an issue!\n* I can talk your ear off, but I can also listen all day, so I should get along with most all people in regards to talking frequency!\n* I came back from a **trip to Saudia Arabia** \\~2 months back, so I can tell you all about that if you like!\n* I've been to the Prophet's Mosque (second holiest site in Islam) and a Jesuit retreat house (Catholic order silent retreat), so I know quite a bit about both faiths, needless to say!\n* **Nature** is simply the best and I absolutely adore it, whether I be hiking, biking, kayaking, boating, going to the beach, or even some exploring!\n* I love history / philosophy / anthropology / archaeology / theology / psychology / sociology / economics + some things I'm probably forgetting (they are mostly humanities, though)!\n* **Travel** is soooooo nice and I want to go most everywhere (near the top of my list though are Kyrgyzstan, Palestine, and Peru)!\n* I am almost always excited all the time, so that's probably why you've been seeing so many exclamation marks (I'm definitely not yelling)!!!\n* Reading is something I revel in and I'm happy to own! [Here](https://imgur.com/KXhWdPO) is my bedroom library!\n* I used to play video games, but I've abandoned that almost completely and am a strong proponent of tabletop games (card games, board games, tabletop role playing games (D&amp;D and others), etc.)\n* I quite like MBTI and **I myself an am ENFJ!**\n* I just started horse riding lessons (I've had a few so far) and love it soooooo much!\n* **I work at a museum** and love what I do, so I'd be happy to tell you about it if that's something that at all interests you!\n* I'm **super family oriented** and **I adore children**, so there's that too!\n* I also love music (primarily listening to it, although I play a bit). While most of what I like are **Arabic songs**, here are some examples if you're curious as to my taste: [Ahwak](https://youtu.be/Od6LJhVvNOI) (Abdel Halim Hafez), [Zourouni](https://youtu.be/Zs_zm_HD9Z0) (Sayyed Darwish), [Nekabel Nas](https://youtu.be/dDG4qCffUv8) (Loai), [Dalle D7ake](https://youtu.be/FuhVm-0pPBY) (Melhem Zein).\n* I've just realized I haven't mention **I'm in uni, studying history** (of course)!\n* Post undergrad, I'm considering **joining the Peace Corps** in either their youth in development or their education department. I so enjoy working with children, experiencing different cultures, and working for something that has a more grandiose impact than just receiving a paycheck.\n* Regarding my career goals, I take a bit of a different perspective than most my peers. While I find most will discuss their ambitions in relation to their career, such as going into law, medicine, and the likes, I don't find that nearly as appealing as how I think of it. I still value my career in its entirety, but where I differ is in what I give priority to. Instead of having my career first and all else secondary, I instead put the priority on having a successful marriage and family, wherein all else will be subordinate. **I'd rather be flipping burgers at McDonald's with a happy family than I'd be a millionaire with no family to speak of.**\n\nMy goodness, I sure have said a lot, haha! I truly could go on, but I don't want to overwhelm y'all! If I sound at all interesting, reach out to me and I'll get back to you as soon as I've the chance to do so!

I am good friend with both the bride and groom and was really looking forward to being in their wedding. In July 2018 I even threw them a huge engagement party and it was a blast. That was the last time we hung out. Me and the bride work together, she literally sits behind me, but we BARELY talk anymore. We used to eat lunch together. She has been extremely distant and if we did not see each other at work we wouldn't speak at all. She's started to eat lunch in her car or she'll sit by herself at lunch or even stare at her phone. \nI have tried reaching out to do stuff together. I thought maybe she didn't want to hang out since I was always the third wheel, she doesn't like doing stuff without her fiance, but I got a BF that has a lot in common with her fiance. We've been together for 5 months and neither has made an effort to meet him dispite me asking them to get drinks or dinner. They always say \"oh yeah we should do that\" then never follow through or will cancel last minute. \nMy other issue is that I have to go on the bachelorette weekend trip. I am having serious doubts about whether or not to go. First, I offered to pay $200 for myself for the weekend, shared with the other 4 girls going and some family so we could get an amazing place right on the strip in the city where we are going. They came back with a crappy hotel 30 mins away from the bars that is $1400 for 2 nights!! Like WTF?? That would be $167 each to pay for only 2 nights, which would be fine if it was a nice place or even have enough beds for us all, but it does not. I found a really nice Air BNB that would run $62 each for the weekend and had more than enough space and bed and she shot it down because the room was booked, but not paid for, and that's what her mother wants. Oh because her mom is going. I felt like that is just disrespectful because she's not paying for it. We are paying for the entire trip plus Ubers to go back and forth 30 mins to the hotel. I would understand if it was her that just really loved that hotel, but we are footing the bill so her mom and aunt can have what they want.\nI already bought the dress so if I did dip out she could ask someone else in time to have it altered.\n\nMy main issue is with all of this, I don't know if I even want to be involved. What's the point? She doesn't speak to me, we don't see each other outside of work, she is completely disinterested in me. I've tried to ask if I did something wrong and she just said it is stress from planning the wedding. Which I get, but we could do a game night, or grill out at home. She seems to find time for them to go to basketball and football games every weekend, but I cannot get her to meet my boyfriend of 5 months. \n\nTl;dr: Friend has ignored me for months, says we're fine, makes no effort to communicate. Should I still want to be a bridesmaid? Is it worth losing a possible friend?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I got a little mad and sent screenshots of my chat with her to the group chat, since he used to tell me things to tell her since she blocked him, yeah, he wasn\u2019t \u201cthe smoothest\u201d with ladies, and everyone just freaked out of what I did, so I left the screenshots for a minute then deleted them, so nothing would be held against me later.

Advice would be appreciated. Last two paragraphs would be TLDR version I guess.\n\n* A - Friend's GF\n* W - Friend\n* M - My Girlfriend\n* W and I are best friends while M and A are good friends.\n\n**A** &amp; **W** have been in a long term relationship and this is their first relationship. Back in November **A** decided to suddenly break up with **W** with no warning. This wasn't the first time **A** has done this, the last time was 1.5 years ago for almost the same reason. The reason is that she only knew a world with **W** and she does not know who she is herself. Therefore, she want's to breakup with **W**.   \n\n\nDuring both break ups I was there to help **W**. This most recent one was more severe as it seems for certain **A** wanted to leave for good, however she kept saying that she loved him and that she'll come back.  So being his friend, I tried to be there for him as usual. Go out for coffees, walks, and drives. Let him get everything out of his system and I tell him it's okay in the end it's going to be alright etc. The usual. Throughout this time spent with him I kept urging him to let go even though she is leaving behind a trail of hope.  \n\n\nHe chased after that trail of hope on the day he was going to return everything and forget about her. Which it succeeded to some degree. They are currently in a weird relationship where it is but it isn't.  \n\n\nAnyways after that whole fiasco, now a couple months later giving him some time to sort things out. I ask **W** if he want's to go out for dinner to catch up.  He respond's with:\n\n&gt; Probably not the best idea, maybe another time. \n\nI asked him if we were good in terms of our relationship. He read's it but never answers. Gave him 24 hours and then I called him out on it. He responds with:\n\n&gt; You and **M** handled our situation so poorly. The last time I spoke to you, you were screaming at me on the phone to leave **A** alone when I was literally out of the hospital not even four hours. \n\nFor clarification, I was yelling at him on the phone because he wanted to chase after **A** even though he was ready to let go and in my experience that never gets a girl back. In regards to I and M handling the situation poorly, yes at some points we were playing the telephone game which I admit was bad, but I know we both helped them individually to the best of our abilities with no negative intent. However, I can't help that it feels like he is blaming my gf and I to have handled the situation very poorly.\n\nHe continues:\n\n&gt;I don\u2019t want to talk about this right now, I\u2019ll talk when I\u2019m ready. If you don\u2019t want to accept that, then I don\u2019t know what else to say to you. I need to clear my head and get my shit together. I have a lot going on.   \nI\u2019m simply stating that the two of you handled our situation horribly. It wasn\u2019t right of us to put you in the middle of it but at the same time, neither of you did anything to help our situation. Again, when I say help our situation. I\u2019m strictly talking about our relationship. Not what the two of you did individually, \n\nThe conversation goes on a bit, but since he really didn't want to talk about it we ended the conversation a few lines later saying we will talk about it when he is ready.   \n\n\n**Advice:** Is it just me or when my friend says the two of you handled our situation poorly in terms of getting our relationship back together a hindsight 20/20? Am I the one who is the bad guy trying to get both of them to let go? Sorry for the long post. Also, I feel kind of used? When he needed me most I was there for him but when he doesn't he cuts me out?  \n", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm an extrovert and right now, I've not got many people to talk to or rely on -- so a lot of times my wandering brain can cause hiccups in my emotions. I tend to be an empath and I'm studying to be a mental health counselor. I'm usually up til odd hours at night. I write poetry. Stuff like that.\n\nThings I really like:\n\n* Music! -- Metallica, Queens of the Stone Age, Royal Blood, Radiohead (obv.), Daft Punk, Eagles of Death Metal, TOOL, A Perfect Circle, Puscifer, My Chemical Romance, Mindless Self Indulgence etc. etc. The list is a lot more long than I have time for. \n* Writing/Reading\n* Stand up comedy\n* The smell of a campfire \n* Hard to answer, challenging questions\n* Playing guitar\n* MMA/Football/Sports in general\n* The Masked Singer/America's Got Talent\n* Anime (to a smaller degree): Goblin Slayer, Zombieland Saga, Aggretsuko, MHA, Seven Deadly Sins, Tokyo Ghoul to name a few. \n* Space stuff\n* Not being cold \n\nThings I don't like: \n\n* Cheese, bees, jellyfish, Mariah Carey, bad alcohol, insects in general, clouds that cover stars, Naruto, those weird dreams where you feel like you're falling and you wake up, wasabi sauce...umm, that oughta do it for now. \n\nWhat Do You Look Like: I am 5'6\", dark black hair, glasses, a beard, spiced rum colored eyes, four tattoos, and probably in jeans and a band tee shirt. \n\nYou: I don't really care all that much about what you look like, where you come from, or what you do -- live your best life, and far be it me, a stranger, to tell you how to do what's best for you.

I am from New Zealand, also known as Middle-Earth, and the \"country always left off maps\" (see r/mapswithoutnewzealand). I grew up in Australia, so I can kind of be a bit more Aussie than kiwi, though I assure you, you can be my \"Bro\" as well as my \"Mate\". \n\nI'm hoping to make a good friend (Maybe 2? I don't want to be too greedy now) who wants to hangout, chat abotu our days, watch shows / movies occasionally, maybe play some games.. If you're a kiwi too, that's a bonus, but not a deal breaker if not!\n\n**About me:**\n\n*The first tragedy; Birth*\n\nOK, Kidding (kinda).. I'm a pretty laid back person, with some big aspirations and goals I'm starting to move towards. I get along really well with most people, and I don't judge (Unless you think asparagus smells good, or you *actually enjoy* eating mushrooms on their own as a snack. What's wrong with you?). \n\nI currently work full time, but I'm planning on going to study *soon TM*. \n\nI take care of my 3 dogs, [Smarty](https://imgur.com/a/dZBkSTT) [Tobi](https://imgur.com/a/6aHOkR9) and my old boy [Paddingotn!](https://imgur.com/a/zlgZIiF). \nThey're definitely my reason for jumping out of bed some mornings (Especially when Smarty is hungry, and smacks me to let me know..!). I also keep and maintain a few Tropical Aquariums, though I don't have any photos saved of them! If you like, I can show you. \n\nI'm also currently working on some weight loss goals. I'm doing Intermittent Fasting, and it works awesome, and allows me to be a bit heavier on calories when I want to. So, if you're after a friend with some goals like weight loss and self improvement in mind, I'm your' guy!\n\n**My Hobbies:**\n\n*The second tragedy; Childhood*\n\n**o** Whilst not my biggest hobby, I want to mention creative writing here first, because sliding the \"tragedy\" thing in my posts kinda gave me *another* idea for my ever expanding list of stories I want to write. Maybe you want to team up and help me flesh out a world?\n\n**o** Aquatics; \nDefinitely my biggest hobby, and something I've done since I've been able to walk. I actually ran my own mini-business when I was fresh out of school, breeding and selling some assorted aquatic fish and plant (Betta Fish, assorted strains of Freshwater Shrimp, and some more obscure guppy strains mainly). I still do keep some tanks, though I don't put my soul into them anymore... \n\n**o** Cars; JDM / Touge loser. What else to say? I drive a [Nissan 350z](https://imgur.com/a/geomDiQ), and I'm planning on doing some work to it *eventually* though, it's got more than enough power for me in it's near stock state. I'm super excited about the new a90 supra, and contrary to popular opinion think it's an awesome platform (Though, I'd much rather a MK4 Supra :) ). Also low key been thinking of buying a cheap Mistubishi GTO, just to thrash. Maybe.. probably not.\n\n**o** The big outdoors; Admittedly, I grew up in a sheltered suburban area, and the closest I ever got to camping was pillow forts in the lounge, which inevitably toppled and broke *something*. Recently been getting into camping, and honestly? If you've never fallen asleep on the beach next to the waves? Do it. Life changing. Luckily, New Zealand has some beautiful wildlife, and tramping spots. \n\n**o** Photography is growing on me. Nothing fancy, just an iPhone camera, and what they can do with a simple point and shoot.\n\n**Intermission** \n\nGreat job making it this far (To you and me, I'm patting my back for pushing through the early onset carpal tunnel to write this!) \n\n**Movies &amp; TV Interests**\n\n*The Third Tradgedy; Alcoholism* &lt;-- also a taste of my off-beat humour\n\n*Movies:* \n\nI'm super keen to find someone interested in watching a movie, or a couple shows together each week? Wether we just hit play at the same time, or watch it over some kinda website (rabbit? something like that I've been told about)\n\n**o** So bad, they're good; The Room? You mean the greatest movie of all time? Thought so. Pirahnaconda? Sharknado? All timeless classics that deserve a larger audience (Ok, not really). But my F A V O U R I T E right now? Birdpocalypse. It even has a sequel, and it's free to watch on Youtube.. We gotta watch this together, ok?\n\n**o** I'm not really sure how to organise this section, admittedly. I love Historical movies, as well as generic action films, and movies that make you say \"huh?\". Space movies, in general, are awesome too.\n\n*Shows;*\n\n**o** Once again, I'm unsure how to list this. I love [Seinfeld](https://imgur.com/a/xgwXyxt), it's my favourite. I also love King of the Hill, Documentaries, Scrubs (I'm overdue for a scrubs marathon) and many, many others. Always looking to expand my watching list! Feel free to leave me a recommendation!\n\n**Video Games**\n\nI'll be extremely honest, I feel like I've outgrown video games a little bit.. they just don't interest me the same way, anymore. In saying that, I do still play them from time to time. I play on **PC** and don't have any consoles, minus a super neglected 3DS. I am more than happy to invest a bit of money into new games to play with you! I am also half tempted to buy an Xbox One (Forza? yes pls) or even a switch (Games in bed / on the move.. yes pls) but I probably wont be, just a heads up!\n\n**o** VR; I want someone to explore VR with! I have a Windows headset, and I keep trying to get into things like VRChat, but struggle to find people to hang out with. \n\n**o** MMOs; I used to be the biggest World of Warcraft nerd *ever*. I haven't played it seriously in forever, but i'm looking at getting back into it casually. If you play (Retail or Private Server) let me know! I'm keen to play! \nOther MMOs I've played are Rift (rip) and Wurm Online (I'd love to get back into this but it's such a big time investment I'm not so sure).\n\n**o** Shooters; CS:GO will always be a little special to me. Helped me (Alongside WoW) through a pretty weird / rough period of my life, and I made some good friends through it. I'm *always* happy to load it up and play a few matches. I used to be quite good (I got to LEM Rank!) but, I'm not so good now (Mid silvers, lol). PUBG was fun, but it's lost its special feel to me now, since it came out of beta. Not sure, I'm weird, don't ask.\n\n**o** RTS; I suck at RTS games, but I love them. If you want to play one with someone, I'm happy, but don't expect me to be a challenge or help at all. Dawn of War is probably my favourite, besides Empire Earth, and Age of Empires (Remember those old discs you'd get in the cereal boxes?!).\n\n**o** RPG; Probably my favourite genre. The hours I sank into Skyrim, just taking everything in is disturbing. I can't really get into RPGs now because they feel like I've either gotta put in a bit too much time to get to the open world, free to do what you want, no forced story etc. \n\n**o** Racing games; I really wanna get the new forza. I haven't played much outside GTA (Which I guess doesn't count) since the old Need for Speed games.\n\n**Music**\n\nI'd be lying if I said I didn't like music. I've always got something playing. Right now it's [$uicideboy$](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiP3tyPzzFg) binging, but I listen to almost everything, from country to heavy metal, and everything in between. Always like being sent music to listen to, and sharing music!\n\n**Finish**\n\nI think i've rambled enough for one day, and I am sure you can piece together a slight image of who I am (I'm happy to send you a face pic if you want, accompanied by a link to r/eyebleach). I'm not fussed with who you are (Unless you're the re-incarnation of Genghis Khan or something, then I think I am obligated to report you or something). I just ask that you try a bit more than \"yeah lol\" as a reply to messages. Please don't feel too anxious about messaging me either, I'll try my best to reply and I *totally* understand anxiety, and other mental health things (I'm a laundry list myself). \n\nThanks for reading (And *probably* judging me for making a big rambly post on the internet about myself). If you want to chat, I'm happy to use any platform except skype, but I do prefer to use Discord (And, I prefer text chat to start with, at least). Thanks again! I look forward to meeting some of you :D\n\n~Luke\n\n", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We were getting along pretty well for now, we've build a great trust for each other etc. She even started giving signs that she wants something more, but I was wary about it so I didn't take a move forward. Everything was fine until new years eve. We were together on a party, she took along with her her best woman friend, later that night her friend kinda forced out of me if I'm interested in her, I said that if she wants to than I might try. My curiosity and analyst nature took over so additionally I asked her if she's interested in some other guys. And that's were everything went to shit. For the next week everything was fine, until two weeks ago I saw that she's definitely pissed at me, I asked her what's wrong and she told me that she's mad at me for asking about her personal life behind her back and if I really was interested than she doesn't look for a boyfriend right not (she didn't tell no or yes directly). I apologized her, listened, and took the blame. Hovewer she told me that we will continue hanging out. I give her some space and avoided talking with her and stopped texting for around 5 days. Later she started texting and talking with me again so I thought that everything is fine. Until a week ago I wanted to sit with her during lectures on university and she yelled at me that I'm following her. I distanced myself from her again, than next day she apologized to me for bursting out like that, we were talking again normally. but since than everything is...I don't know how to describe it, there's that weird dense atmosfere between us. When we're alone she still talks to me, but more rarely, the same with texting, and because of that I try to generally avoid her because I fear that she'll once more burst out that I'm following her or something.

Click on this post...", "author": "rubentew", "self_text": "Hi there!\n\nMy name is Ruben, I'm an 18-year old computer science student from Europe. I used to spend lots of time on online chat platforms such as Discord chatting with others about my and their everyday life, deeply connecting with these people, because we meant so much to each other. Now that I spend virtually all my time studying, I have kind of given up on that pastime. I realized, however, that I have full control over how I spend my time and decided to involve myself in the things that I love most, keeping a healthy balance, of course.\n\nA little more about myself: I love playing the piano. I've been playing for over two years now and bought an 88-key digital piano about a year ago, which is now comfortably taking up considerable space in my tiny room. I learned to play classical pieces, which I still practice to this day, and spend some time on learning other pieces of music I really, really love on the side. Recently I've been wanting to get into playing jazz on the piano, my roommate had this course book lying around, which he told me I could use. Music's always been my passion, I don't go out without my phone and earbuds nowadays. In my opinion music speaks a thousand words and reflects infinitely more emotions. It's a very powerful thing.\n\nI also (used to) love playing games, though not as much as when I was in high school. It's very difficult to free up time to play games nowadays, as it oftentimes doesn't really contribute to anything and as I oftentimes lack the discipline to call quits at some point and resume my studies. I was heavily addicted to League of Legends about 4 years ago, I used to play about 7 or 8 hours of League of Legends a day. High school wasn't really challenging and of course playing games was really worth the time (I still don't know what got into me back then). I also spent considerable time on playing chess in my childhood, which I've gotten decent at over the past few years. Strategical games really interest me, they allow my mind to put their teeth in a tough challenge and endlessly ponder on the vast possibilities regarding my next move.\n\nA few years ago, I came up with the idea to learn a new language. I had my eyes set on Japanese, since the culture really intrigued me. The fact that mutual respect is so important and prominent within their society fills my heart with curiosity and excitement about involving myself in their culture and one day travelling there to immerse myself in the Japanese language, nature, food...\n\nI could keep writing about the life I've led and the kind of person I am right now. I'm very open-minded and I'd love to hear more about your life, about what you're dealing with, about the fortune, however small, you've found today... anything. I'd like to add that I have gone through quite a lot of shit myself to get where I am and that I am confident that you'll find a supportive and helpful friend in me.\n\nI'm looking forward to chatting and getting to know each other!\n\nLove,\n\nRuben.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

My older brother denied me literally everything - obtaining friends, having boyfriends, watching shows I want to watch, read books I want to read (i haven't read any book other than harry potter, that's the only exception). I have never tried different restaurants, never had particular beverages (non-alcoholic). I was even denied having an opinion and to feel things because it meant i was ungrateful. The schools i have been to literally don't teach anything properly, so a lot of the typical knowledge known i have no idea. I also have very bad memory, so I tend to repeat myself a large majority of the time. Another thing that i should bring up that was a very big problem to him: because of my culture, we throw the rice in water before it boils (i'm hispanic, latin american descent. Literally every hispanic i know cooks this way). The defining reason i have never tried other types of food is because my family struggles with money. My mom had to leave my dad many years ago because he gambled almost all of the money to the point that we almost had ti=o file bankruptcy (during the time, she wasn't a naturalized citizen until i was in high school). I was literally denied the many luxuries a kid would want because money for a home and food is very important.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to him (20M), I am wrong and i have no excuse to have never read books or know things that people are suppose to know. To have tried different restaurants, to read all these authors i have never heard of, to have fancy items and to \"properly\" cook rice (throwing the rice in after the water boils). His father's family has a lineage of doctors, his parents are straight A students, and technically wealthy because financial aid has denied any grants because they make too much money. He has told me things that i find unusual or just strange and i completely accept that because you know what? people are just different, people have different interests than me and have grown up differently than i have. I  also know how it's like to never be heard and accepted, so i literally give hime every good reason to be able to just be himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut he criticizes every single thing i have done and every single thing i have never experienced. He tells me i'm wrong when i do something that is actually normal in my house. He tells me i have no excuse for doing something that i have never heard of or never read a book he's read or do things he's done as a kid. I know it's because of the difference in finance and upbringing, but i feel like he genuinely doesn't care. There are times where i understand being completely honest when i ask for some advice or an opinion that has happened. I understand being told i'm wrong on facts that can be defined, and is literally discoverable on the internet. But i just feel like whenever i mention i haven't done something before (which is literally everything he's done) its like a huge problem to him (he also says hispanic food is disgusting). I don't know if i should consider being friends with him or not... What do i do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - a friend tells me i'm wrong in different aspects connected to how i grew up. What do i do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nupdate: he and i are part of a friend group, and 2 other people (both F19) are getting pissed at his attitude and would do the same to them.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We made these plans a month and a half ago and I've been checking in to make sure this weekend still works for him. I talked to him yesterday and I was like \"so I'm coming around 5:00 on Friday\" and he's like \"Can you come on Saturday, that's my boyfriend's birthday and we're going to a party\". I was really upset at him for this because I switched around a lot of things to make this weekend work. I usually work 6-7 days a week and told work I couldn't cover the weekend shift because I was seeing my friend. He has only been dating this guy for 2 months and this guy is incredibly clingy. Anytime I'm with my friend he says he has to text him back right away or else he gets bombarded with texts about not answering. I don't have an issue with him seeing his boyfriend, but what how could he just casually ditch these plans that we have had for so long? I feel like he doesn't respect my time and the effort it goes in to planning things.

It's to the point where the other day I nearly messaged her and asked for clarification of some minuscule thing that happened 2 years ago. It's madness.\n\nThis has never happened before. Most internet friends I can get over in a month max, but this girl, even when I was depressed and not online whatsoever, was always on my mind. It's made me kind of resent her for something she has no clue that's going on. I don't know what I'm asking here or if I even know what's going on in my head. I don't even want closure or any shit like that, since we never even left off on bad terms and we're still relatively friendly. I just want to know if someone has any experience with something even remotely similar to this, because it feels like I'm losing my damn mind. \n\nThe closest thing I've heard to someone being \"hung up\" is people being unable to get over an ex, but this girl wasn't even my best friend at the height of our friendship. I understand if this sounds bizarre and if I sound like a complete weirdo, but just anything would help me understand what's going on in my head and steps to take to \"get over\" someone I'm not even into.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

He passed away earlier this year. Just before this I got out of a 4.5 year relationship. I was bullied alot growing up all the way up to high school. And all the friends I made, turned to drug addictions. There were a couple of friends that stated on the sidelines, and hang out once or so a month and the other every 2 weeks. Thing is I feel like If I seen anyone of my friends go through what I've been through I would make an extra effort to hangout as frequently as possible and pull them out of the hole their in. Neither of them really have done this, and when I opened up about my problems, they kind of just aknowledged it and that's it. I feel extremely lonely as I haven't had anyone to actually really connect or talk to in years. I'm hurting and my anxiety from being bullied years prior as creeped back, and has been up and down on a daily base. For a long while now every time I attempt to hang out with friend A (monthly) he bails or something always comes up, when he does come through we waste the whole day catching up and this has been going on now for years since he started dating. Friend B hangs out quite a bit and is there for me financially, whenever I need a physical hand at work, but emotionally not so much. I guess I just don't know what to expect from friends, cause not everyone is like myself. My friend who passed would've stopped at nothing to hang out with me. \n\nI guess my problem is I just dont feel like the friends in my life now actually care as much as I do, or they've never had no friends. Honestly, I'm at a loss I've done everything to be a different person, or a better friend, there isn't something I haven't tried.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

In a general conversation, I'm more of an awkward type because I never really hung out as a kid so now here I am, and I can't hold a conversation for my life which worries me for prospects of dating in the future, but that's a topic for another day, and of course per the rules another sub, not that I'm looking for that here, anyway. Being as that is, I would need someone who can drive conversation and or is talkative because I really have nothing. I only really ever had one true friend who stuck with me from middle school onward to what now is college and I am grateful to still have them as a friend today. But at the end of the day, what I am is an extremely awkward person around new people and in general and I want to change that, and improve my social skills which I neglected to improve on for so long. I'd hope to find someone willing to bear with me and my crippling awkwardity if that's even a word. With that aside, I guess a bigger topic at hand for this post would be information about me, I'm basically just going to expand on what I already said and more so here it goes:\n\n- I eat enough chicken to the point where I should start growing feathers. Chicken is one of my most favorite foods. It really isn't good for my teeth and all, but I've grown attached to Coke.\n- I'm currently attending college working my way to a computer science degree, then afterward I intend to transfer and get either a bachelors or masters in Cyber Security, not sure which level degree I want to pursue yet but I'll decide that when the time comes.\n- I play quite a lot of games, I used to be an avid Call of Duty player as a kid, but now my interest along with my skill in the game has degraded slightly. Back then, and now still, I am mainly interested in multiplayer games because I don't really find it fun to play alone unless the game has a campaign that really interests me, for instance, Metro: Last Light or Dishonored. Nowadays on the game front, I play games like Dead by Daylight and Last Year: The Nightmare. Funnily enough, I used to hate 3rd person games and only played 1st person games. Ever since I ran into Dead by Daylight, my views on 3rd person games has since shifted, but I just feel weird playing some 3rd person games. One genre I for sure am not into is top down, for some reason I just can't stand those games. \n- Now I guess I could talk about my physical self. I think I probably have some type of depression, not entirely sure which but it would make sense if what I'm exhibiting lines up with a type of depression. I'm no doctor though so I'm not self-diagnosing, it's just a feeling. It's not, however, the kind of depression where I'm having thoughts of harming myself or something like that, though I once was there some years ago. I wear glasses, have blue eyes, brown hair, I weigh more than I'd like to admit, but I do want to lose it, I'm growing a beard or I guess somewhat of a goatee. \n- I guess this should really fit into the above point, but I'm just going to give it a new point anyway. I used to have friends, but leading into middle school what friends I had got thinned out. By the time I reached 5th grade I really only had one friend but I was getting bullied big time. That stopped in the next grade and it got better from there, but for some reason, I just wasn't open to anyone lending their wing out offering to be friends. Something in my head just stopped me from getting into real friendships that could have been and I kick myself every day for it, but that's why I'm here. To start to get to know people and put an end to my internal conflict (hopefully).\n- Now for the media and entertainment bit aside from games. As for music, I like mainly rock, rap and metal music. Some of the bands I listen to include Black Veil Brides, Slipknot, Korn, Drowning Pool, Linkin Park Fallen Fate, Killswitch Engage, Twisted Sister, Daft Punk, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, Post Malone, Evanescence, Firewind, The Fray and many more. As for movies and TV shows, some of the shows/movies I watch/have watched include Stranger Things, SpongeBob Squarepants, Family Guy, The Simpsons, John Wick, Jason Bourne, Radio, Antman and The Wasp, and more. Too much of what I listen to and watch would take a while to list here, lol.\n- Favorite color is blue, but that doesn't extend to what I wear because I really have no sense of style. When it comes to what I wear, I'll put on whatever really, but I'm mostly into wearing just solid colors. \n- I like to travel places even though I really don't get the chance to do so that often at this point in time. 3 years back I went to Germany for an exchange program, and also made some stops in Switzerland and Austria. Those were amazing countries and I'd like to go back some day. \n\nOK, so I know those bullet points are all over the place, and I still have more to say but for now, I want to see how what I wrote pans out and if anyone is foolish enough to read what came out of my random stream of thought in its **entirety**.

Our friendship started, I think, because of me. You see, when we were younger, he was that type of guy who couldn't speak up for himself, most people made fun of him (not bullying, just no one took him seriously, and whenever he said something others just laughed). And I hated that.\n\nI guess I \"saw\" something in him, that he's actually a good person, so I started talking with him alot, I stood up for him when neccesary, I started teaching him about confidence, how to express his opinion, those things. For me he became a younger brother.\n\nIn time he changed, for the better I mean. Confident, not afraid to say his opinion, not caring about people who don't deserve it. We spent almost every day together, and he thanked me for everything, how I changed him. We were best friends.\n\nFast forward to today, he has a GF for a year now, and I have no problem with that, but she introduced him to her friends, well and they spend almost all the time together, he doesn't even text me to hang out with them. I know them too, so it's not like I would be a stranger.\n\nOkay, I could get over that, people change, life goes on. But what's KILLING me is that when we do meet, and he gets a little drunk, he starts saying how I'm still his best friend, and that it pains him that we can't see each other more often.\n\nLike what the fuck ? How hard is it to text me or call me whenever they're going somewhere ? And when I want to hang out, he's usually like \"I don't know\", \"I can't right now\". I tried to show that I still care about him, asking him how his day is, what's new, etc., but he responds like if I'm annoying.\n\nWe see each other only once a week now, sometimes twice when I happen to be somewhere where they're going. I'm angry, sad, frustrated, I'm scared I'll loose my brother... And I don't even know why. I would at least feel better if he stopped talking like he misses me and there's nothing to do about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to make of it, if there would be some closure, or a reason, at least I could move on, but like this ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Those are fine things, and I do some of them a little bit, but they aren't my passion and sometimes it can be hard for me to find new friends with whom to discuss some of my more unique hobbies since my interests are a bit different from the norm.  I would hate to think I was boring someone!  Likewise, I can't have multi-hour conversations about video games because I maybe play 2-4 hours a month... I'm still trying to work my way through \"Witcher III\" for Pete's sake...  Likewise, I don't care about memes or YouTube \"celebrities.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am in the legal profession in the United States, East Coast.  I don't mind where someone lives/nationality, age, orientation, religion, politics, or gender, because people are people to me and I decide if I like the individual, not the label.  I have friends much younger and much older than I am, from many different backgrounds, and I cherish them all.  My interests are (in no particular order):\n\n1. Reading and collecting books.  I have a substantial home library and I love nothing more than to sit in my favorite chair with a good book and some good music.  My area of focus is c. 1750 - c. 1950, both fiction and non-fiction.\n2. Vintage cars.  I have two so far, one of which is a complete maintenance hog.  I'm trying to teach myself how to service it, which has been challenging as I didn't have anyone to teach me while growing up.\n3. Friends.  We enjoy going to lunches/dinners, playing games (board games, primarily), going on random adventures to small towns to check out the antique stores/pawn shops/attractions/museums, and building/fixing things.  We also do outdoor movies with my projector, bonfires in the back yard, and just hanging out in my garage while I curse at some part on my car that isn't working.  I have a reasonably active social life.\n4. Sports:  I don't care at all about professional or college sports.  Zero interest.  I don't even watch the Olympics.  I do and have participated in a few as a hobby:  Fencing (epee), equestrian, and target shooting (I mostly use antique rifles).  I also know how to ballroom dance, if that counts!  I work out every morning to stay in shape and that's the extent of my interest in it.\n5. Electronics.  I have quite a few vintage computers, typewriters, and other devices and I enjoy new ones, too.\n6. Music:  I can play the piano and I enjoy listening to '80s music, \"oldies,\" big band, and classical.\n7. Woodworking.  While no artist, I can make sturdy (read:  overbuilt) and functional things in my shop.\n8. History.  I'm just crazy about the past, and I live in it to a large degree.  I have quite a few vintage suits, I often drive a vintage car, I use fountain pens almost exclusively, and I just naturally do things \"the old-fashioned\" way.  I have an especial interest in military history with a focus on naval matters.  \n\nThere's lots more, but I figure that would be enough for someone to see if they'd be interested in chatting.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do I offer?  In addition to discussing the above, I'm considered a very good listener and I am very sympathetic in nature.  I believe that every person is deserving of compassion and friendship, no matter what they have or are going through.  I'm not someone with whom you need to put on a happy face, and I will cry with you as willingly as laugh with you.  I had a rough childhood with a messy divorce, no father, bullying, and abuse, but I'm stronger for it now and I have a very good life.  However, it means that I understand at least to some degree if you've been through difficult times.  I am the sort who goes through his Discord (my preferred messenger program) list periodically and just checks on friends I haven't heard from in a few days.  I'm good at remembering your interests and hobbies and I will generally want to learn about them if you're willing to show me.  I also enjoy it when I have creative friends who share their art or writing or music or other with me because I have \\_zero\\_ artistic talent.  No, not even a little!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you think we'd get along, please drop me a line with a note about yourself!

He is honestly the reason I can go to school everyday we support each other, he helps me with my work and we joke around like friends do. The thing is he's trans and to be honest I never saw him for being trans just who he is. Yesterday we had an orientation night for high school  (we tour the building) he came with his dad and brother I went with my mom my other friend and her mom. When we toured the school everything was fine, but the next day my friend asked me if my mom liked him I asked him why he would ask that he said that whenever he looked at my mom she would turn her face so I asked her about it today. My mom asked if he was trans and I said yes then she told my dad. My dad wanted to talk to me about my friend he said that it was ok if I said hi once and awhile and we shouldn't hang out. I was devastated I really didn't think he would asked me something like that he said that God made a man a man and a woman  a woman. I didn't have words so I only sat there and listen to him about how my friend was a bad influence and I should stop hanging out with him. I don't know waht to say to my parents I know their hearts are in the right place and their worried, but that's my friend my only friend that has classes with me and I can't just leave him he's had enough of that I won't just leave.\n\nSorry for the long post I really need some advice thank you for reading.

I'm really hurt over this because she had been going through and I've made she I was there to support her no matter what this past year and every we have drama it's always because of her. She did this kind of stuff quite a lot in the past where if I did something that bothered her she would just ignore and not tell me why, but whenever she did something I didn't like she would look at me like I'm the bad guy and make me feel immature. \nSince I lost her as my friend I decided I don't want to go through that same hurtful process with her that I've been in for 4 years now.

If you\u2019ve clicked on this post then I guess you\u2019re somewhat interested in hearing about me\u2026 right? I\u2019m just warning you, I may go on a little bit of a tangent here, so prepare for a novel length post! (Woo!) So to start with, my name\u2019s Jake. I\u2019m a 6ft 4 (Giant, I know.) 18 year old guy from the UK. And in case I seem familiar by this post, I have posted here before, but to little success\n\n**So, what are your interests, Jake?**\n\nGlad you asked random internet redditor! Well, I\u2019m into quite nerdy things. First off, I adore comics, and comic related media. I\u2019ve always loved comics ever since I was a kid. As well as comic related movies and TV Shows, such as Daredevil, and any of the MCU movies. In relation to comics, I\u2019m also really into art and drawing, and I like to think I\u2019m fairly decent at it (If we talk I can definitely show you some of my art!) and I\u2019ve been drawing my entire life, and have spent far too much money on supplies. I\u2019m also heavily into PC gaming (and even built my own PC a few years back!), and enjoy various different games on steam, and quite a few creative games. My favourite movies of all time include Avengers: Infinity War, Back to the Future II (My number 1 favourite movie of all time!) and The Martian. I also love TV shows such as Parks and Recreation, The Office, Doctor Who (Mainly the classic series), Black Mirror, The Flash and many many more. In terms of music, I adore music from the 60s to the 90s (Including The Smiths, Madness, A-ha, ELO and many more. Oh, and my sense of humour is EXTREMELY dark, so if you like offensive memes and dark humour, I\u2019m your guy!\n\n**Anything else you should know?**\n\nOn a more serious note (and this is more than the likely the part that is most likely to turn you away, which I hope not, but still) I have severe social anxiety, which means I find talking to people extremely difficult, so if we\u2019re going to call, you may have to deal with my anxiety for a while before I\u2019m able to pick up the phone. Social situations are really difficult for me to be around. I also have issues with depression (so you may have to deal with me on depressing nights), and I\u2019ve been self harming every since I was 13 (but I\u2019m doing better at the moment, so yay me?) I really hope isn\u2019t something that\u2019s an issue, as it\u2019s a big part of who I am, and I really would appreciate just having someone who supports be, and can be there with me through it.\n\n**So what am I looking for?**\n\nWell, Honestly, I\u2019m just looking for close, long friendships. Not the kind where we talk once every two weeks to catch up and that\u2019s it. But friendship where we talk daily, or close to it, and have inside jokes, laughs, and are just there for each other frequently, and look forward to talking to each other. What do you have to have in common with me? Absolutely nothing! In fact I think it\u2019d be even more interesting if we have little in common, as we can learn from each other, and find out new things! Your age, gender, sexuality doesn\u2019t matter to me at all, obviously someone around my age would be nice, due to relatability etc, but honestly it\u2019s not a strict guideline, and I\u2019d be happy talking to absolutely anyone!\n\nSo, do I seem even remotely interesting to you? Do I seem like a contender for friendship? If the answer is yes, message me! I\u2019d absolutely love to hear from you!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Had a best friend in high school and well into college that I was completely inseparable with but you know the story. Friend meets girl, best friend kicked to the side. It never was the same after that, maybe 5 or 6 years back. I never received an apology for how poorly I was treated and later when we patched things up, I was once again stood up constantly and ignored. I stopped talking to her for 3 years till the summer. It was pretty cool to talk again until I realized that every time I would suggest a hang out, suddenly I wouldn't get a text back.\n\nWhat was finally the last straw happened at my bands concert. It was a big show and we were playing with a really kick ass touring band that could help us gain momentum. My friend reaches out to me asking what time I'll be playing, how much are tickets, etc. Dude talks to me up until about 30 minutes of when she says she would be there. I hear nothing. Text again saying I'll be on stage in 15 two hours later. Nothing. I don't let it get to me. I text my friend one last time saying that I tried my best to fix things but it's clear that it will always be a one way street because they would rather lie and fuck with my head than to be a real friend like we used to be. I wished her well and then I proceeded to block her and slept so well that night.\n\nAnyway, my point is that I gained enough perspective to see that just because I want to be a good friend doesn't mean I'm a failure if I have to walk away and I think so many are in that situation. People can change after they make mistakes, but you shouldn't bend over backwards just to hold on to something if you're the only one who has tried.

Before I start, I\u2019d like to apologise in advance for the length of this post. I am completely new to Reddit and so I have no idea what to expect or what is expected of me in terms of posting rules.\n\nI\u2019m a 25-year-old married guy from England and have had no friends or social life outside of my family circle for 5 years and have only had one close friend in the last 11 years who sadly passed away in 2014. I\u2019ve had clinical depression since I was 13, serious social anxiety since I was 15 due to horrendous school bullying, and I am now in the process of a formal autism diagnosis.\n\nObviously, because of all these factors I find making and keeping friends incredibly difficult. I love my wife very much and she truly is my best friend but since my close friend died, I have been longing for someone to fill that particular platonic void in my life. \n\nI can\u2019t help but feel my interests and hobbies do not help my case. I have always had interests that are widely considered to be \u201colder than my years\u201d such as Genealogy, History, 60s/70s Prog Rock, 80s horror films, etc. I have never really been a party-goer or a nightclub enthusiast. I\u2019d much rather find a quiet pub for a drink, chat, and maybe a game of pool. This is largely due to my low self-confidence and social anxiety issues. I can go weeks without leaving the house at all when I\u2019m experiencing a particularly bad patch of anxiety.\n\nAlthough they are huge parts of me, I do not want my mental health issues to define me. I realise that people I know label me as \u201cthat guy with MH problems\u201d and that upsets me quite a bit. I just want to be treated like a normal human being for once. I was bullied my entire school life from 5 to 16 years old. I have no fond memories of school at all and the years since then have been equally as tough for various reasons. I\u2019ve had a lot of bad luck and I\u2019ve trusted a lot of people who just took advantage of me and hurt me. Now I just want genuine people in my life who I can talk to about shared interests and hang out with. I just want friends.  \n \n\nI\u2019m far from perfect and due to my issues patience is sometimes needed with me, but I\u2019m super loyal, witty (apparently), and excited to see if anything comes of this post.

Not sure whether other people experience similar feelings. I'm getting what people mean by mixed feelings now. Anyhow the thoughts are am I making a bigger deal than it is? Should I let her go? I feel its time to look ahead but maybe I don't need to completely ignore her? But i don't know what to do either? Though I feel relieved of confronting my friend this time about defining the boundaries in our relationship and I need space, yet I feel she doesn't understand what I mean. \n\nWe met in uni, and became close friends quickly. In these years, we spend alot of time together, we went travelling together, like always in contact with each other either message or hangout. So 2019 is our 5th year however things have gone pear shaped. Our issues started appearing I believe is from 2018.\n\nSo in 2018, been single for a while and family friends have been introducing new people and I decided to give it go. So I spent 2017 new years eve with this guy and my friend was waiting to hear all about it, she was more excited than I was. And was happy for me to begin to actually be in a relationship with a guy. Then the next couple of days she become rather sad and distant. So I was concerned and went it find her. Why I was concerned was that she said she had 3 shots of coffee and walked all the way from her work place to St.kilda which is like a far bit of walk. She sounded just real low. So I went immediately to find her. She didn't say much what happened on the day when I went to see her, but I just stayed beside her before she went back to work. Tried to cheer her up in different ways. She did feel better after a while and explained later that it was a sense of feeling threatened that now I may not spend so much time with her and also something had happened in her family. So we talked through it all and I hope that she could put a little bit more confidence in our friendship that we wont be pulled apart that easily with me being in a potential  relationship. So after all the talk and we were back to our normal state. Me and that guy didn't end up in a relationship in the end because of incompatibility in lifestyle. \n\nSo things were still pretty good until a few more things cropped up I feel like it's something I've done that upset her. And these episodes became more frequent and it seems to be always around the same thing. She indicated to me that she needed to feel more security, which sometimes being with me, she felt insecure. She pointed out that I suddenly disappear when she messages and then come back to the message after a long time without even a saying what happen, I just continue the conversation. She didn't need to know where I was or what to was doing but I should have just said I have something to do so talk to you later would have been appropriate. I thought, yeah guess that would be soemthing I should do. I usually just put my phone in my bag when I catch up with my friends, anything important, people will call me. I don't take out my phone often, it's only when I feel oh, it's been a bit long I'll check my phone just in case. So yeah, so we talked about that and we move on from that. \n\nThen later on the year I introduced my other friends around me to her that she heard me talk about. She was very quiet through the whole entire night. Only when she gets home she sends through a text explaining her behaviour and apologises. Stuff like it's her period or we were talking about uni and past stuff which she couldn't say much. But we weren't. So she hopes I can understand and won't put me in a difficult situation. We then talked through this as well together and then we moved on from there too. \n\nThen I met another guy my family introduced me too and we met once and started messaging. One time I remember that we were going through issues again, and it was mainly about what happened previously with my friends and stuff. We went out that night for dinner together and talked face to face. While driving to the dinner location that guy texted. So I just asked her to quickly reply him on my phone that I'm driving and going to dinner so I'll be home really late, we'll talk tomorrow. She did that and then went on to ask if she could chat to him. So I was a bit thrown away with that so I said okay? And asked what she was going to text him about. She introduced herself and said that she is using my phone as the friend and asked for his photo, he didnt have one now, doesnt like taking selfies and she pushed him to take a selfie instantly or when he gets home to send one through. I asked her to stop and consider my feelings before she continues anymore of this. Then we talked about this and about previous friend stuff and moved on from here. But this time, I was annoyed and upset with what she did, it made me really uncomfortable too. We talked through all about this too. Moved on. \n\nNow towards the second end of year, it's seems like her insecurities are getting to her. She feels like that I don't value her as much and shes not important. She feels she can be replaced by my other friends. I spend time with others without her and also have a good time. She feels I don't think of her or care of as much as she does. So she starts to become passive aggressive with me in her text if I make her upset over things like I didn't spend time with her or she feels like I'm hiding stuff from her now, don't tell her things. Well honestly at times, I don't know what to tell her on some occasions when I hang out with other friends, because I'm scared that she may become upset again because of the passive aggressiveness of text. I don't like conflict so I avoid them. And with dating life, me and that guy didn't continue on after that event either so there's nothing to share about that. Now this type of conversation between us starts to gets more frequent with her doubting herself and me. \n\nSo how it a became pear shape was this time I decided to cut her off. She mentioned to me one or two months before new years eve that she doesn't want to work this year and want to take time off. She started planning stuff we could do together, I told her I cannot commit to that because that day I know my family will be arranging stuff. Then the day comes closer, she asked if I wanted to go to do something with her friend together on new years eve and I said I won't make it that day as my family arranged dinner at family friends place and we are going to their place to eat and celebrate new year and their daughters wedding. Then her passive aggressive attitude came across in her text that night, and the next day. So I sensed that she wasnt feeling the same but I thought, we talked through again and again about the same stuff, maybe I might be overthinking this but I should asked her, so I asked is everything okay and she said yeah. And asked why do I think she's upset, so I said I just felt it but not sure so I wanted to clarify but if your okay then it's all good. Then later on she messaged that I was the one hard to deal with emotionally. So thought what? Then she said I didnt talk much today and usually I message alot during the day. I thought what and what? Anyhow, next day I messaged her like usual and she didn't reply. So I left it at that. Then about 1am in the morning she texts happy new year. I didn't want to reply. So I didn't. Then all these texts and messages came through with her explaining everything and she mentioned that she was upset and she gets all emotional at the end of year, which I know about. So she thought not talking to me with the right thing to do at that time. I didn't reply either. I honestly didn't know what to do or say. I just left it in that time. \nShe tried calling I rejected, she want to come over to my house the next day and I rejected and said I didn't want her to come, I need my time alone. But she insisted that why she can't come over she just wanted to come over to watch a movie and then won't bother me. I insisted if she comes I'm gonna go out. So I did. Then the next day, she was sitting outside the garden opposite my house like at 8 in the morning. So my dad spoke with her and she went away. He wasnt planning on telling me that this happened until I got a text from her telling me that she spoke with my dad, she wasn't actually coming to my house, just to the nearby park and my dad was right so she decided to cancel Japans trip and bought a one way ticket back to her home country. Not coming back. I wished her all the best and wished her well. \n\nThen while she is back overseas she sends me a emotional messages about that she cannot get over it, hope we can still be friends and not ignore her anymore. She cannot overcome this, she hasn't told her parents but she's gone to see a psychogist about this and she is currently taking medication. I just feel bad hearing this but then I feel like I am being manipulated. Anyhow she sending texts through every now and then about what she's doing in and then going back to this topic of emotional stuff. \n\nGod I typed so much and emotional till typing it up and reliving these moments...\nAny suggestions or comments??", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We don\u2019t really have anything in common that I can relate to, she loves romance and comedy. I like those too but not to the extent she does. She likes Taylor Swift and brand names, and seems a little stuck in her high school days (then again she is only 19/20?). She reminds me of the preps that I didn\u2019t get along with in middle/high school. She and her brother seem to love trap music lol, and she\u2019s really into social media. I\u2019m not really into any of those things, I\u2019m kind of a silent introvert who likes to do my own thing, but I also don\u2019t like rudeness or being told what to do. I once asked her if she wants to study with me at the library, but then I realized I couldn\u2019t because my mother wanted me to babysit my brother, and then she\u2019d say things like \u201cthat\u2019s fine ttyl I\u2019m out bye.\u201d Now she wants me to bring my lab notebook that I\u2019ve done last semester in microbiology.

Some people think about how they've been alive for 2 freaking decades, celebrating a cherished and evergrowing existence. All I can think about is how I'll no longer be a teenager, and that I'm still going to feel like one for a long time.\n\nI haven't grown. Haven't developed responsibility, a desire to specialize in anything, or motivation to be a real adult with a job, stable income, home, and family. All I can think about is my youth. Meeting for lunch in the school library every day with my punk best friend, talking shit about all the bullshit around us, and sharing and discussing things we like, new and old. Going on trips, whether it's a walk in the park, a hike through the woods, a random drive around town, or getting high as fuck. Dancing to our favorite songs in our rooms, rocking out in our band, rebelling in every way we could, and taking in every moment like breathes of air you can taste the sweetness and bitterness in that let you know you're alive. There's both pleasure and sadness in imagining all these things, probably depending on your mindset. My youth was nothing like it, and my best friend is just a figment of my imagination. It's where I am in my head and where I want to be in real life, and I can't see myself ever moving past it.\n\nIt's hard to sleep sober, and 3/4 a bottle of cough medicine once a week seems to be my only source of happiness (feel free to inquire about that despite the risks). I grind out the dull moments with video games and movies until there's nothing left I can stand. I'm pretty much a failure, and I don't have any desire to fix that by getting my shit together. I just want to be where I belong, and the older I get, the further it strays from my reach.\n\nI need a friend, but I pretty much know I'm not gonna find the one here. Of those who say anything, 70% of you will say one thing and nothing else, 26% of you will exchange a few words with me and then go your own way, 4% of you will talk with me for some extended amount of time and then things will somehow end disastrously, and 0% of you will turn out to be my best friend, according to all my past experiences. I guess desperation ignores all odds.\n\nMusic is the most important thing I have. Rock is where my heart's at, but I like a majority of genres. I play a bit of guitar, piano, and banjo. I love animals and nature and would prefer to be outside rather than inside. Social media, memes, today's top music hits, pop culture, and society can all fuck off. (sorry) (just kidding, why the fuck would I be sorry?) I panic when I think too much about people who are suffering and being wronged in the worst ways possible. I'm an outcast and always will be. Painfully touch starved. There's always more, but why bother writing it all out.\n\n*You can't hold on to the thrill, so I hope you find your will to follow through.*", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

(No recourse, just gone) \nLive in hotels out of town just to get kicked out for paying a day late and having to move back in.\n\nGained weight, kind of my fault* quit smoking for health reasons right before damn holidays (Southern food is fucking tasty lmao) 24 pounds in 30 days. \n\nDrink to be able to sleep ( PTSD &amp; Insomnia ) and end up with a DUI and and pay that off just to get a drug charge for trafficking cause someone had drugs in their bag in my vehicle so we all went to jail. So that's fun. \n\nSend money home all the time, just to put myself in a bind and have to live paycheck to paycheck. \n\nThose are the cons.\n So, to lighten this up, here are some pros:\n1: Std free\n2: Finally quit smoking\n3: Own my own vehicle. ( it will work one day! )\n4: My skillset are so varied I can find a job anywhere\n5: Sometimes I'm funny.\n\nSo, since I'm really bad at writing for help, and I believe we all make our own luck, why do I continue to be a fuckup and live in chaotic nonsense?

{"post_id": "akhkda", "created_utc": 1548633867, "title": "My fiance's roommate made life super awkward; seems to blame me now", "author": "FluffyGreenTurtle", "self_text": "This is gonna be a long one, my apologies for that, but I just found this sub and would really appreciate some advice.\n\nFirst, a brief background: I'm finishing my senior year of college, graduating in May, and my fiance lives 2 hours away, so I only see him about once a month, but I visited him for both Thanksgiving and Christmas break. (I'm 22F)\nMy fiance (I'll call him \"Joe\")(24M) graduated a few years ago, and lives with a friend of his from high school (25M). (\"Mark\") \n\nNow, I didn't know Mark very well until around Thanksgiving, when I visited my fiance and stayed at their place (I'd been there a couple weekends, but usually Joe and I would go out and I only interacted with Mark while playing board games, etc.) Over Thanksgiving Break, Joe was out of town for a work meeting for a day, so Mark and I talked more and got to know each other better. We ended up going out to look at some stuff for mine and Joe's wedding, grabbed coffee, etc., and I had a fun time-- Mark's a nice guy, and we got along pretty well.\n\nUnfortunately, after that day, things started to get really weird. Mark seemed to think that we were suddenly best friends and would text me a ton, and I chalked it up to him just needing another friend, because the majority of his friends are in relationships/dating/engaged/married, and he's very single. I was busy finishing up the semester, though, and didn't really spend time thinking about it, but he texted me a LOT.\n\nDuring Christmas Break, I realized that things were worse than I had thought. Mark insisted that we should talk and get to know each other better, and whenever I was having a depressive day (I struggle with some depression) he would act like he had a right to know how I felt about everything. He also had multiple breakdowns about being lonely (which I get, loneliness SUCKS), but when Joe and I tried to comfort him he started wanting hugs from me (just Joe wasn't good enough), and then when I got a cold, he wouldn't leave me alone and kept trying to \"help\" even when I asked him to let me just sit in front of the TV with a box of kleenex in peace.\n\nI was super uncomfortable, and I talked to Joe who (thankfully) felt uncomfortable about it too. I think that Mark was just immensely lonely and since I was one of his few female friends, he had started treating me like a girlfriend (in an emotional sense. I'll clarify that he never made any sort of sexual advances toward me and I do not believe that he was attracted to me in a sexual manner). Joe and I talked to Mark, who felt terrible about everything, apologized a ton, and seemed to understand that his behavior was not okay. \n\nAnd then things got horribly uncomfortable in a different way. Mark decided to just completely avoid interacting with me for the rest of the time I was visiting Joe. He'd leave the room if I came in, he wouldn't even look at me. Right before I went back to college I tried to talk to him and explain that I wasn't angry at him; I just need space to figure out healthy boundaries. He asked if he could still talk to me, and I said that was fine.\n\nIt was not fine. The next week (the first week of this, my final and hardest semester), he proceeded to text me multiple times a day. Far more than my fiance. Lots of \"good morning\" and \"good night\" messages, \"how was your day,\" nothing inherently bad, but just...the sheer number was insane. I didn't respond until a week later, when I finally told him that I needed space, it wasn't okay for him to text me so much, it felt OBSESSIVE, and (in much nicer terms) that him being obsessed with me was going to severely turn off any other women who might possibly date him. \n\nHe texted me a day later and apologized, but his message was also laden with lots of \"I understand that you probably hate me right now\" and \"hopefully you'll forgive me for everything.\" It felt very...\"pity party, woe is me, help me feel better, let's have things go back to how they were\" and so I ignored it for a few days because I'm not going to tell him that his behavior was in any way okay, and things were NOT okay how they were, so I'm not going back to that.\n\nI visited my fiance last weekend for just a day, and while I was there, I attempted brief interaction with Mark, but he still mostly ignored my existence. \n\nI messaged him this past week and told him that I had already told him I forgave him, and that he needs to find healthy way to move forward but I have confidence he can do it.\n\nWelp. Today I got a super long message from him:\n\"Yes FluffyGreenTurtle I did feel that I needed more forgiveness because you forgave me but I continued to fuck up. And I'm sorry I fucked up but I assumed that you would at least message me back once or something. And I recognize space is healthy but that's why I said you didn't have to message me back, I would rather wait to hear from you than keep messaging at get no response. So you think I'm not moving forward? Because all I want is to move forward from this, but some days are hard and Clearly you should know what depressing thoughts are like. When you were here it was clear that I make you uncomfortable so it's hard.\"\n\nFirst: He knows that I have bad depression and was suicidal over part of Christmas break. I know (because he's shared a LOT of personal information with me) that his depressing thoughts are just him being sad and lonely sometimes. That he would say \"Clearly [I] should know how it feels\" isn't okay, and he should know that from what I've shared with him.\n\nSecond...I just don't even know what to respond with. It feels like he's trying to put the responsibility and blame more on me, when all I've done is try to stand up for myself. And Joe is stressed out, because he's stuck inbetween this weird situation between his roommate and his fiance, and he doesn't want to take sides (I don't blame him), and I'm really bothered because it sounds like Mark keeps dumping stuff on him.\n\nAny advice at all? I don't know where to go from here, but I'm stuck interacting with Mark on occasion because Joe is living with him till our wedding in August.\n\nTL;DR: Fiance's roommate became possibly romantically attracted to me/ kinda obsessive, I told him I was uncomfortable and to stop, and now it feels like he's trying to make it be my fault that things are uncomfortable for everyone.

My current flatmate, we were super close about 6 months ago before we lived together but he\u2019s turned out to be a bit of a prick to live with tbh so we\u2019ve grown apart a bit although we\u2019re still amicable.\n\nAnyway, we happen to have a mutual family friend. My childhood best friend\u2019s dad (who is my dad\u2019s best friend) remarried to this woman who is one of his mum\u2019s friends. We were both at their engagement party and I introduced my childhood best friend, let\u2019s call her Kate, to my current flatmate. Kate and I used to be super close before she went to boarding school and kind of ditched our previous friend group - I was sad about this. However we started reconnecting over summer especially as she was moving to the same city as me for university so I was excited.\n\nI thought we\u2019d see each other much more now and kept reaching out only for short conversations where she would eventually end up reading me.\nMy flatmate, because he could probs tell I was annoyed at his behaviour (won\u2019t get into this) no longer really invites me out to do things even though I try to with him (hurtful)\n\nThrough seeing reactions to Facebook posts and \u201cx is interested in\u201d newsfeed posts, I began to suspect my flatmate and Kate had become friends. This bothered me, because neither of them had mentioned it to me, when I have been extremely close to both of them at some point in time. They were both also neglecting their friendship with me, for what it seemed was their friendship with each other. \nOver time I realised they were really close. Flatmate still never mentioned this to me, which I find really shady seeing as I introduced them. \n\nFamily friend hosts a party, I\u2019m invited but have other plans, flatmate lies about plans (I specifically asked what he was doing and he didn\u2019t say this party) but the rest of my family go and he is at the party with Kate.... and this is where it gets worse\n\nBased on more social media things eg Instagram likes etc (I\u2019m not a stalker I swear haha I\u2019m just observant) I realised my flatmate\u2019s  best friend (who I was friends with last year although I changed friend groups this year) was probably dating Kate. This was confirmed to be true by my parents when they went to the party and he was also there. This is clearly a big deal yet no one has ever addressed fact that we know each other, let alone the fact we were literally best friends. I mean, she\u2019s been to my fucking granny\u2019s house in another country ! Where my family are from! Three times! You\u2019d think when she met someone who had me as a mutual friend she might say something, or the guy might wonder about it. But no.\n\nLiterally saw the guy the other day and he said nothing. Was with my old group of friends for someone\u2019s birthday. One of them literally mentioned Kate\u2019s name and I just had to play dumb. None of them have said anything about me knowing her. It just seems like such a massive betrayal to keep this from me. One of my closest friends in that old group now has Kate as a Facebook friend. I refuse to believe she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing.... he has been on my social media numerous times so she surely knows we are friends. So why has she never said anything?\n\nNobody has ever explicitly told me anything, I\u2019ve just worked it out from observance. I feel massively betrayed by multiple people in my life and I don\u2019t understand why. It just seems so unnecessary. Why keep it a secret from me? The fact it\u2019s been kept a secret has hurt me far more than just telling the truth would have. But I feel like my trust has completely gone. And it makes me very sad. My flatmate, I still have to live with him, when I know he\u2019s kept so much from me and neglected me and literally gone after someone who means so much to me. And well with Kate, it just taints our entire friendship and thinking of her just makes me incredibly angry/upset. As for the boyfriend, it bothers me she\u2019s dating him as he\u2019s a prick, there\u2019s a reason myself and others distanced ourselves from the old group to begin with.\n\nI have all these emotions, and I don\u2019t know what to do with them. But now my friendships seem fraudulent. And I\u2019m sad. Help? What do you think about everything? I feel like confronting would just make it awkward seeing as we live together.

Currently watching Black Clover, MHA(well waiting for the season anyway), Baki and the list just goes on. I can watch pretty much any type, really enjoyed stuff like lovely complex before too. Gaming wise, currently playing on PS4, mostly fighting games like Dragonball fighters Z and Injustice 2. I got Tekken 7 and SFV as well as MKX but put those aside for these. I also like story-driven games but with my current job I'm too mentally exhausted to enjoy a good story.

On the very first day of this year we got really into this musical and have been obsessed with it ever since and we've talked about it a lot and written about it and so on. Lately they've started hanging out with a girl from their workplace and like lowkey I was jealous already (I'm not jealous of their relationships with any of our other friends so idk what it is) but now they just sent me a picture of them watching the musical together... and it pissed me off. They'd already been talking about our discussions with this person which irked me because those are my words and my jokes they're sharing. \n\nAlso, we were going to watch the musical again together later today when suddenly this person invited them over which only made me a little jealous but when they were like \"we're watching it together :)\" I just didn't even respond because it made me mad. That was like 30 minutes ago.\n\nI know I don't have an actual right to be angry because it's not my business what they do with other people so of course I'm not gonna say anything. But why am I so jealous??? (It isn't just this musical, btw. I've felt like this before but I honestly can't tell if it's only with this friend.)", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I have posted on the infj subreddit and got many responses, but so far I haven't yet clicked with anyone, but that could be because conversations have only started between us, and I don't know much about them yet.\nI will tell you a bit about me. I know this might sound rude but, please only dm me if you think you are like me. If you are not, I will just not feel the 'click' and it won't work out. I can usually hang out even with people who I don't 'click' with but only in irl. Not really online, where a connection is the most important thing.\nI am looking for someone under 26, male or female. I am in a relationship so I am not looking for anything like that :)\nAbout me:\n-my biggest goal in life is to help people through being a counsellor, so i love to discuss psychology\n\n-i am not gonna say everything good about myself so i am also gonna say i suffer from anxiety from time to time.\n\n-i am extremely passionate and can get extremely excited about things. I love to philosophize and think of abstract ideas. My Ni is pretty high.\n\n-i love deep topics, with me you will always get back to some deep topic. Nothing is as it seems, nothing is simple.\n\n-i love to daydream, imagine things, and therefore i love beautiful art, music and stories. From music I love so many but favourites I guess are old Serbian music (i am from serbia), Nick Cave, Fleetwood Mac, Queen, The Smiths, Sia...and many many more. Favourite movies: mr nobody, cinema paradiso, quentin tarantino movies, ghibli movies. Art: everything that is pretty, and the best ones are the ones that have a lot of meaning.\n\n-i also LOVE hiking and nature. And travelling. I want to have many plants in my house when i am a bit older.\n\n-as a friend everyone says i give good advice and if someone is my friend i truly am always there for them. I can get hurt though if you are not caring enough, and then i might become distant (happened with other friends). I will still appreciate you but will distance myself to not get hurt.\n\n-right now i am replying slowly to messages but if i am really interested i will reply a looot. Since i have exams soon i dont get much time to chat so preferably i want someone who will exchange long messages and then if we become friends.. Chatting, video call, visiting each other. Whichever!\n\n-i like logical things but not too logical. So if you are extremely logical and are most likely going to be cold, you are probably not for me. Same for feelings. I love feelings but I dont like too feely things and no logic. A balance between the two is the best. ", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Use the Mail feature, NOT the new Chat feature. I've found that better interactions are had with the former. Maybe it's the fact you can't tell when they're typing, so messages don't rapid fire, or maybe it's the UI which is similar to common messaging apps. Who knows. \n\n2. Go through their post and comment history, talk about something you found thats funny, unusual etc. maybe they've shared some life story on r/askreddit, or have a common passion/interest.\n\n\n3. Something big that's going down in the news or Reddit, a current topic that you'd both have opinions on. I remember talking to someone about the EA Battlefront 2 shitstorm that went down last year despite neither of us owning the game, because it was a general Reddit-wide event. \n\nSUSTAIN\n\n1. Share something personal, whether it be an experience or thought, or something you need advice with. \n\n2. If the convo is stale, just wait till the next day for a fresh start. Don't be afraid to simply ask stuff like 'hey so what should we talk about'. If the other person also wants to continue talking, they'll be happy to recieprocate. \n\n3. Share something you watched on youtube or a TV show to get them to watch it. If they say they watch a TV show, then watch it as well so you can discuss it \n\n4. Once you've established some kind of good connection, make sure you try to have some kind of interaction every day, however short. Try to establish other forms of interaction, maybe voice call or gaming. \n\nAll these things will work will if you naturally click with the other person, like if the kind of language you use is the same and if it's a balanced convo in terms of effort, and if you're both equally enthusiastic to progress the friendship. Ive been talking to one person who I found off this subreddit for around 2 years now and didn't have any common interests, just a common passion of learning new shit and discussing it.

Is/Was it even real at all?", "author": "Holy_NightTime_Diver", "self_text": "So, hey guys, I am kinda confused about my feelings about my friend group. I'm a 16 M (I guess that's how you abbreviate...) and I've had this friend group for 4-5 years. But before I talk about that, there's somethings about me you need to know first that may relate to this.\n\nThroughout my life, my family moved a lot for financial reasons. We were never homeless but we did struggle a lot. Because of we moving a lot i never really kept my childhood friendships. I was a kid back then so I didn't understand that that could make a negative impact in my life. As much as I was smiling and trying to be nice, my perspective on the world around me was changing and I began to stop liking stuff that I enjoyed before, and I was getting more cynical, egotistical, and was ready to close doors to people around me.\n\nBut then... I moved to the place that I am living now. And I think I was 13-14 years old when I met the first person that I could consider a friend(lets call him T, I saw someone name people with letters for privacy, seems reasonable). T was a good, extroverted, kinda crazy guy. He had 2 other friends and we started hanging out together in the school's hallways and T came to my house from time to time so we would play together. We were also in the same class at school (I live in Brazil, so the students don't go to different classes, they stay and the teachers change classes instead).\n\nNext year though, T was put in another class, and we could only meet in \"lunch time\". I was more confident after having T as a friend and made more friends that became a stable group. So that was cool. Me and T still were friends and we didn't mind having more than one group of friends. But I wasn't really getting better. I actually became more narcissistic and lacked a lot of self-esteem. My native language is Portuguese, but my friends and parents could easily see how easy it was for me to learn English, and that became something I would brag sometimes, I can also draw, but for some reason never decided to brag about it, which is good. \n\nSo, years passed... and the group was kinda ok... but there were a lot of problems, mainly T and I were getting more distant, and one of our friends (call him B) had moved to another city for 2 years, came back \"just to visit\", and said he was gonna go back to his city, but actually stayed. We saw B on school and asked to him and he said he wanted to make a \"surprise\". T and another one knew about it before, and it never felt like a surprise at all, made some friends at the group mad, and they got distant as well.\n\nNow in the middle of 2018 I started deeply reflecting my own life and was having constant existential crisis, but that helped me. I had a conclusion. I was never seeing my friends for who they really were, and I started feeling really guilty for not always being there and for being a dick to them sometimes. I saw traits and characteristics in my friends that inspired me to get better, for them. But the more I think about it, the more I fear that they don't feel the same way. \n\nAnd now it's 2019, january, and I feel like this friend group is getting more and more distant. As if people never wanted to hang out or talk about their emotions. Which is ironic cause I'm the one going to therapy to actually be able to open up more. It would be easy to just say \"If they don't really love you then they were never your friends and you should let them go\", but it's just so complicated, I feel so connected to them, and sometimes I think I owe them. I feel like I need to have a very deep and emotional conversation with the whole group, but they are never vulnerable enough to talk emotionally, and the fact they don't always want to hang out.\n\nI really want for us to be more like a real friendship, where we help and understand each other...\n\nWhat can I do to make my friends actually talk serious to me?\n\n(Sorry if this was long...)", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I have a friendship group in person but honestly most of my friends are pretty boring people and I can never play games with them because they're always playing things that I don't really like, such as fortnite, r6 siege, NBA 2k19 etc. Any conversation I have with my friends through messaging only lasts about 10 minutes and are pretty bland. So I'm hoping to change that with some new people.\n\nI hope to find some people who live in Australia, or with a time zone close to Australia, but I don't care too much, we just won't be able to talk or play as much if our time zones are far apart. I'm also only looking for people around my age, so about 13-16. I don't care about anything such as gender, sexuality, race etc. as long as you're cool I'll like you. I'm thinking of maybe starting a discord server, but I have no idea how to do that so it's not definite, but I will update this soon if so. I usually respond as soon as I can and I try to never ghost anyone. If I don't reply I'm either asleep, have gotten distracted by something or maybe some other reasons.\n\nHere's a bit about me if you're also looking for a group and think I might be a good friend. I'm a pretty lazy person, I spend most of my spare time indoors playing games or watching shows. I do walk my dog often and sometimes go to a pool and swim laps so I'm not 100% couch potato, but around 90%. I play lots of different games. I mostly play on Xbox, occasionally on PC, and sometimes on PS4 (I don't have ps plus though). Right now I've been playing red dead redemption 2 on Xbox and it'd be cool if I'd be able to play with some friends. Some of my favorite games of all time are Skyrim, Spiderman PS4, Destiny 2, Half-Life (the original), Left 4 Dead 2, Assassins Creed 2 and a few more. My favorite shows are Breaking Bad and Brooklyn 99 and at the moment I am watching through impractical jokers and dexter. I really like animals, although I still eat them because they taste good, so fuck you PETA (I have nothing against vegans unless they try to change other people's diets to fit their wants). I mostly like cats, I have a little 4 year old tonkinese kitty and a 3 year old German Shepard pup. They're the cutest little things on earth.\n\nSomething you'll need to know is that I am very cautious of who I am talking to. I will ask you to send a picture of you're face while doing a specific thing with your hand to prove that you aren't like a 50 year old pedo or something. I'm sorry if you don't like that, but I probably won't trust you if you don't. I will also do the same afterwards to prove that I'm not a pedo either.\n\nThere's still a whole lot more about me, but this is probably the most detailed thing I've posted here. If this isn't enough info for you for some reason, then feel free to go through my old posts. They're pretty much the same as this but just a lot more brief. I've probably approached this the wrong way, and I doubt anyone's gonna read all of this, so it's probably useless. But if you have read through this or just skimmed through and you're interested, pm me. I usually talk to people on either discord or Snapchat.

I was also going through my last year at school (lots of stress and exams) and my parents separation (which was, and still is, fucking messy). so I started seeing this guy who's super great and I hung out with him a lot in between school and stuff. then Sarah messages me and basically says she thinks I'm ignoring her. I say sorry and I try to put more effort into talking to her, as I didn't even realise I was ignoring her, so it definitely wasn't intentional. a few months go by and I haven't heard from her. I try to message her, call her, organise a catch-up, I even asked her mum to see if she wanted to see me. nothing. she barley replied to my messages. then right after Christmas her dog is put down. she tells me and says 'you don't have to say anything because I know it's hard'. so I don't because I don't even know where to start. I instead try to go see her in person to talk about it and give her a big hug. she seems to always be busy so I couldn't even get a chance to see her. now I message her and say I think she's ignoring me. she says she is on purpose because apparently that's what I was doing to her. we have a massive fight over text (which isn't the best way to talk) and I tell her i want to see her in person to say sorry but she doesn't reply. I asked if she was free one day and she said yes but she really doesn't seem like she wants to see me. so my main question is: how do I fix our friendship when she's ignoring me, hates me and doesn't want to see me? \n\nTL;DR: my best friend and I had a fight and now she is ignoring me and is not even giving me the chance to say sorry or fix the situation even though she probably wants me to fix it. please help. it's killing me.

And then I have to go for my dinner, so I excused him but he asked me to stop but he didn't stop teasing me saying he want to feed me with his own hands... and i felt really awkward and blushed and sent him laughing emojis. \nWhen we met again I talked to him casually and there was his another female Friend was also with us... he suddenly said that \"you both girls (her friend and I) are only true friends of mine... No, Xyz(her friend) is not my friend, actually She is in love with me.\" And he left in a hurry. That girl was embarrassed and  I was dumbfounded because the way he was treating me from last few weeks, I got confused that maybe he likes me?\nI was upset and when I met him later that day, he asked me why I am looking upset? And I just said i need some space and I distanced myself from him... So he started asking my friends that what is wrong with her? And one of my friend jokingly said that she must be upset because of you... And then he asked me again that if I am upset because of him? I lied by saying no... And I cried later. \nI want to stay away from him from now on... This was just too much for me... I felt like he don't care about me, and whenever he has no one to play around he returns to me to play with my emotions. I felt played by him. I mean what kind of friend flirts with his friend? especially when he don't want any relationship also when he knows the other person has feelings for him. I am just so much hurt. Sorry for my bad english, i am non English.\n\n", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

But, like, nesting doll layers, not nasty onion layers.\n\n* *Layer 1*: I usually present myself as a rather well adjusted, polite little lady because I don't want to scare anyone away. But that usually lasts a day or two, then you hit\n* *Layer 2*: a very smol, tired, lonely and cautious blanket burrito full of tears and fluff. I hide under my pillow fort waiting for you to say hi, but if you just coax me out with cheerful and relentless conversation initiating and invitations to hang out, I will be an ecstatic little puppy! Do this enough and you might be so lucky as to activate my final form.\n* *Layer 3*: I'm a very strange fluffball, I can be hyper one moment and sleepy af the next, but I am relentlessly goofy and loving, and I will adore you and be here for you. I will want to share everything with you, from meme spam, small talk, and music to multi-hour long talks about philosophy and the deeper meaning of books and movies.

The perks of trashcan real estate, amirite?\n* **Reading** - Books are good to distract from trash smell. Also, they construct beautiful worlds and who wouldn't love that?? Sci-fi and fantasy are my favorite! I really like the Scythe and Diabolic series as well as Ready Player One. Finally getting to Harry Potter literally right now. Please give me more books, I've only ever had the ones you threw away :'c\n* **Writing/Worldbuilding** - A natural extension of my love of reading. I am working (slowly) on a 6-book science fantasy series that is my life and joy. It only coats my walls with sticky notes and timelines. My dream is to be like Tolkien, my inspiration the depths of the Star Wars universe! (Don't even get me STARTED on Star Wars!)\n* **Movies/TV Shows** - I have a huge squishy rotten soft spot for sci-fi, crime procedurals, and suspense/thrillers or well written dramas. Sherlock, Black Mirror, The Office, The 100, Stranger Things... all favs!\n* **Music** - I'm a normie, I like pop, rock, and techno. I can feel your cringe from here, I understand.\n* **Deep Stuff** - Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, meaning of life, that kinda thing. Love all of it!\n* **Creepypasta** - A new interest of mine, as I've always been a bit of a wimp when it comes to horror, but turns out I love it!\n\n***\"Alright, alright, not bad.

I said \u201cyeah because you never answer anyways so there\u2019s no point.\u201d She also gets upset when I don\u2019t answer her things (like going to a job interview.... same exact scenario.

Do you tell the person what was sent, causing the sender to be angry due to breaking their trust or not tell them and just try to play it off as if it was nothing to really worry about, as it was just a joke in good fun but causing the other one to get offended because they trusted you not to mess with them behind their backs?\n\nWhat I felt in this situation, was a sense of being cornered by the friend who said \"don't tell them\" as this specifically antagonized me and gave the other one full context that it was about them. I ended up not telling them anything which caused them to \"storm off\" aka leave the voice call.\n\nWhat would have been the morally correct thing to do? ^I'm ^bad ^at ^this.\n\nPS: In hindsight the moment they said \"don't tell them\" gave the other full context and exposed themselves so I probably should have just said what was sent in respect of the other? ^Humans ^are ^weird ^...\n\nI've removed gender from this situation out of curiosity of what kind of response I'd get.

(if you dig around in my post history, don't be a jerk about it)\n- I am available to chat via Hangouts, Discord, or Kik.\n- I like to make jokes and be sarcastic, and I enjoy memes on a very deep level - the more crispy the better!\n- I am a pretty open person, am generally friendly and quite compassionate.\n- Bonus points if you're proficient in English (and can tell me why the word English is *always* capitalized)!\n\nLong story short, I'm looking to make a friend/companion who plays E:D, but is also open to being friends beyond that also.
