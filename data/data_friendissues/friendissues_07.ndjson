So, instead of trying to make a good impression, I want to do the very opposite.\n\n-I'm married, to my first love and currently only friend (we have been together half my life). He travels a lot and is kind of successful. I think he is a bit ashamed of my lack of social skills or status because he doesn't introduce me to his friends. I don't mind as I don't want to ruin things for him. I usually just wait for him to come home so we can play games and watch tv.\n\n-My family is also successful and they had really high expectations of me - everyone did. That didn't go anywhere and now I am looked down upon by my three siblings and my parents. They don't respect me or my time nor take my job seriously. I know I deserve some of it. So I don't really stand up for myself much, and when I do it just sucks. Its like they could all do without me.\n\n-Ideally, I wish to have in-person friends (people to go out with, people to invite home and be invited to, etc) But I feel like I manage my time badly and end up unintentionally ghosting people by not talkimg for days. Also I am really shy and I feel like I am not interesting enough for anyone to be interested in being my friend. I wish there was a way to battle my lack of self esteem, but nothing has worked.\n\n-I wasn't always like this. I actually was more sociable and started isolating myself as I grew older. I have some idea why (feeling of inferiority and failing in life).

We\u2019re just plain acquaintances. Anyways, whenever he has his days off, he would come over to our house without any prior notice or phone call. He can be nice sometimes and we do enjoy his company but it gets extremely annoying when you have someone invite themselves over at least 3/4 times a week. \n\nThis is what usually happens: He would just show up at the door and enter without asking. Then after that, he will find something to eat and if there\u2019s no cooked food at the table, he will cook eggs without asking again and to make it worse, he won\u2019t ask if we want some. He will just eat the eggs by himself and doesn\u2019t care if we haven\u2019t eaten yet. He would also switch the TV channel without asking and he does it while I am still watching TV. How rude, right? He usually stays over until 10 PM.\n\nOnce, when we were grocery shopping, we went home a bit late, around 9 PM. He helped out a bit by carrying some grocery items but he asked me to cook dinner because it\u2019s getting late for him. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 I even remembered one another incident that he opened a bag of chocolates that me and my bf bought without asking and he didn\u2019t ask again if we wanted some. He even complained that I didn\u2019t buy some corned beef and I bought fresh meat instead. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 Whenever he\u2019s here, our eggs are always getting emptied. Also, whenever the dinner is ready, he would eat first and doesn\u2019t care if other people haven\u2019t eaten yet. He does the dishes but it\u2019s not really cleaned properly so I had to wash them again. Ugh \n\nHe would also ask my boyfriend to fix his car for free and he has lots of demands and to make it worse, he would complain if he heard that my boyfriend isn\u2019t working on to his car. He also called me average and when he\u2019s about to leave our house, he would just tell my boyfriend goodbye and not me, despite of being aware that I was there. I feel I am being used, abusing my kindness and being taken advantage of. \n\nThe thing is, I wouldn\u2019t mind inviting him over. I just hate the fact how the thinks he like, lives here and come over whenever he likes. \n\nThe other thing is, he\u2019s really rude and inconsiderate. He doesn\u2019t mind making awkward comments and uncomfortable jokes. He finished his seasonal job already and I hate the fact that he would come over EVERYDAY like before. He\u2019s been like this for more than a year. \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11 \n\nIt may seem like I\u2019m letting him step all over me and my boyfriend, but there is nothing else I can do. He\u2019s older than us and can get a lot of people to hate us especially me if I do anything wrong.  \nAnyone have any advice? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 Sorry if this is long, it\u2019s just been bottled up inside me.

So after going on holiday with my friends I realised I was completely different from them and needed distance. I wanted to remain civil and friendly but not put them at the centre of my life. I became too resentful and would appear as judgemental and arrogant because I was so desperate to connect to them Cos they were the main people in my life, but they are at completely different intellectual and maturity levels and I definitely can come across as annoying or rude but I was desperate for them to grow and see the world how I did. I stopped that shit because I realised it was a fault in myself trying to control others and the resentment was toxic for them and me so I distanced myself so I didn\u2019t really speak to them for a while so that I could feel more positive in myself. I then went through a really hard time with my mental health, a break up and only one reached out to me who\u2019s always been my best friend since childhood, I noticed they stopped inviting me out and it confirmed in my head \u201cthese people really do not like you\u201d, and instead of me distancing I felt cut off and isolated.  I posted in a group chat in which they were in amongst many others to tell them i was gonna have a little bbq for my birthday. I didn\u2019t want to exclude so I just sent it to everyone. Then my other friend spoke to me for the first time in weeks after ignoring me, saying she misses me and I should come out. I ignored because I was confused that she only messaged me when I provided something good in her life, but she messaged a couple more occasions and I replied saying sorry I\u2019ve been busy and stressed out. I was confused why she only messaged me then.  I then tried to bring up how maybe people were sick of me to my closest friend who had actually been talking to me, but she sort of pushed it aside. I was convinced they were all mutually agreeing how annoying and shitty I was. What caused me to speak up was when an apparent \u201cbbq\u201d was cancelled so I asked if they wanted to hang out or go to a pub and then all read and ignored and next thing I see is them all at the guys house having ignored me so many times. I just felt stupid and angry, so eventually I just said you guys are bitches and snakes, why pretend to care for me When you don\u2019t want me around, i told my best friends the others drag her down, which was probs not a good idea but she\u2019s great to hang out with alone but with others she gets annoying. I told her that I was trying to distance myself but I felt completely cut off and they are all very sly and fake dismissing any problems there may be. I said to my best friend that she was only talking to me because she\u2019s empathetic and nice but it\u2019s sly because she\u2019s part of the excluding as much as anyone else. The two girls I was closest with sent me paragraphs, and were pretty mature about it, not getting angry and were totally upset I felt like that and that we had drifted but were so nice and I felt so guilty for holding so much resentment. It would help if I knew they probs really didn\u2019t like me and would talk about me because now I\u2019m scared I over exaggerated. The other girl was horrible and said I only care about my own feelings and I\u2019m negative and she doesn\u2019t wanna be around me and she thinks my ideas are contradictory and weird and many others think that too, she said I need to sort myself out and work on treating others with the respect that I think I deserve- I was confused because if she thought this of me why the hell did she reply \u201cI\u2019ll come\u201d to my bbq, and why would she want to at all if she felt this way about me, I certainly wouldn\u2019t.  I know how self absorbed I seem and how I can be negative, I have bad ocd and anxiety and one of my compulsions is literally talking about my problems to gain reassurance and I hate doing it, but this kinda hit me like a bus. I felt like such a burden, thinking I was \u201cthat\u201d person, that negative person that people can\u2019t stand to be around. I was scared I was a horrible horrible person and that second I thought for the first time in my life that people would be better off without me, truly and really, I thought it would be easier if I wasn\u2019t there to drag people down. Of course I rationalised and said \u201chey this is me being negative\u201d - I\u2019m so desperate to help myself to become better and more positive I\u2019m going on a retreat, I\u2019m going through a massive change of life right now, and I\u2019m happy that girl said that because i can now just cut her right out knowing she doesn\u2019t like me. She\u2019s a very strange person and our friendship had no solid foundation, we never chilled sober or met up unless in a group. \n\nSo sorry for long post but I wanted to get it out and rant about being hurt.

So, I need a little help as I'm stuck in quite a complicated situation with my best friends.\n\n(Warning: Long post ahead, but please read all of it so you get the full picture)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's start with a quick introduction. I have 3 very good girl friends. I'll call them Chloe, Alissa and Vanessa for simplicity's sake as their real names are kinda hard to read in English.  (We're Romanian btw)\n\n Chloe is a classmate of mine and we are VERY close.\n\n Alissa, Vanessa and I have been friends since like 3rd grade. (We met because our parents were friends and wanted us to hang out)\n\n All that being said, I love and care about them equally and consider them my best friends. \n\n So, Vanessa and Alissa HATE (when I say hate, I really mean HATE) Chloe. Tbh, I don't even know why, they're just holding on to a stupid grudge. For a few years, I was able to be friends with all 3 of them. It was annoying because whenever I was with Chloe I sometimes had to listen to her talk shit about Alissa or Vanessa and when I was with Vanessa and Alissa I had to listen to them talking shit about Chloe. I was always a good friend to all of them and didn't gossip about them or anything, of course.\n\n But about a month ago I had drama with Chloe over something she did to me and my dumb ass told Vanessa and Alissa everything. Of course, that gave them a reason to hate her even more than they did. So they told me that I should never talk to her again. I promised them I wouldn't go back to her because I was very mad at her and didn't expect we'd ever make up. But of course, I gave Chloe a second chance as I missed her and again, we are VERY close.\n\nNow, Vanessa saw that I commented on one of Chloe's Insta pics and she's mad at me. I haven't talked to Alissa yet but I bet she's mad too because her and Vanessa are basically attached  to the hip and I bet she told her. Tbh I'm so exhausted because we've been through this so many times in the past, I just want to be on good terms with everyone but they're acting so childish. I don't wanna pick between the most important people to me. What should I do?\n\n Also. I just realized this literally sounds like the stupidest most childish teen drama lmao but please take this seriously. Any tips on what to do are appreciated! &lt;3", "subreddit": "friendship"}

But still we tried to get the tickets through official sale. Which we all know is a lottery. And we were not lucky. Tho my friend got really offended. But I explained her I really need money for license and car and new job. Since that day she doesn\u2019t speak to me. \nSince that day she wrote me only one time asking which time we can check in and check out of the hotel. \nSo we have not been talking 6 months. Now I understand that I don\u2019t wanna go with her. But if I cancel the hote she probably won\u2019t be able to allow herself another hotel. \n\nPrehistory of our relationship is also has ups and downs. She is very impulsive. She is very needy and makes fights over everything. \nShe likes to cry over everything and I have to calm down her that her parents love her. Friends love her too. But she is almost 30 and doesn\u2019t realize that parents want to live their life same as friends have their families and their business. \nOne time we were flying by lowcoaster. And to sit together you need to pay extra. She advised doing that. I said : if you wanna pay , you pay. It\u2019s just 2 hour flight. \nShe was screaming and blaming me that I Don\u2019t wanna spend vacation with her and therefore if I don\u2019t wanna sit with her on a plane then I don\u2019t wanna and spend time with her. And we shouldn\u2019t be even together on a trip. Just book dif hotels and etc....  \none time she got in a fight with a policeman. She was cursing him. \nAnother time she hit her bf with a heel for not wanting to spend time with her. \nShe was always offender if my bf wasn\u2019t paying for her at cafes , bars. \nI mean yeah. She is weird and impulsive and she curses me too. But never accepts her blame. So I have to apologize for everything. As I\u2019m very friendly person. I don\u2019t want to fight. I accept person with all its negative n positive sides. \nIt\u2019s not even the first time when she stops talking to me. But before maximum it was two months. Now it six. And I don\u2019t wanna live in one hotel room in an awkward silence.  \nWe have more then one month left. Now that I remember all that stuff and see how needy she is and childish over things  I really feel that I need to cancel it. Should I do it or not.

My biggest fault in baking is that I'll never get a custard to properly stand because I have such a crushing fear of splitting the custard from baking too long that I leave the thing half baked. But there's nothing in baking or cooking that actually scares me so much that I refuse to do it. That's the secret to it, just don't let it scared you without a good reason.  Sorry, got off on a little tangent there.\n\nI'm super into hockey and soccer (though I have a passing understanding of most American sports), and I've played them both through college. (I still play beer league hockey when I can.) I'm a big time Tottenham fan, USWNT fan, and I want to pull my hair out watching them, but I do give my backing to the USMNT, too, unless they're playing England. Then it's the Three Lions all the way!\n\nI'm a big reader, mostly into history, both fiction and non-fiction, I don't care.\n\nI enjoy discussing the bureaucracy of different political systems far too much. Oh, and I scream at sports more than I care to admit.\n\nJust hit me up if you can actually hold a conversation yourself and let's talk!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Although I've met really cool people over here! And I'm hoping to meet more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo about me...\n\nI'm really into art. Like highly into art. I'm drawing, painting, creating, and collecting. Oh recently also photographing. People tell me I'm very creative but I don't like to brag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Music is a big thing for me as well. I listen to a lot of different stuff. Mostly the crap before the 00's. With a few exceptions. For the rest I got an old soul. I would love to be a 70s, 80s or 90s kid. We already got a too big 60s population. But I'm mostly into rock, grunge, indie, alternative, and more. Oh btw, please send me some good indie playlists, I've been browsing Spotify for ages and I can't find anything which fits my mood. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also into movies, hell yeah binge-watching Netflix. Together? Sure why not? I love dramas, thrillers, sci-fi, crime, horror, indie, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn general I'm a pretty happy person. I can ofc have some depressing moments. But I do not have any anxieties or depression to rant about. I do have ADD and maybe autism (PDD-NOS) my therapist is considering that one. So I hope you know these terms a lil and don't mind me being a bit different. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we connect well, I assure you I'm a great friend. I'm always there for you, trustworthy, loyal, advice giver, listener, and more.\n\nI'm btw not a gamer, nor a anime fan, or Harry Potter fan. Sorry, not my thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy expectations of you...\n\nBe about 15 +/- so a max of 2 years age difference. Older people are nice, but yeah... idk.\n\nI hope you can talk a lil well, like coming up with loads of topics instead of only keeping it to small talk. I love to go deep, philosophical, or funny. So I hope you're a lil more extraverted than I am.\n\nBe openminded. I'm btw not religious or anything, I support the LGBTQI+ community, and I'm open to anything.\n\nDon't be a creep. I'm not interested. You shouldn't read this post if you just want to send me dirty pics of you and expect me to send anything back.\n\nDon't ghost me. I know it happens a lot. We're probably all victims of ghosting. It's shit. I know there are exceptions but you can always tell someone you don't want to chat anymore.\n\nSend me some info about you! I'd love to hear from you and it's far easier to respond if you have some text. Instead of only 'Hey, wanna chat?' I won't respond to that anymore. I don't like the awkward convos of 'Ok? who are u?' \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think that's enough right? I should have begun studying hours ago. Oops.\n\nThanks for reading all the way through.

I just recently finished reading Notre Dame de Paris (aka: Hunchback of Notre Dame) and I found myself relating substantially to Quasimodo. Not because I'm particularly bad looking, but because I have great number of disabilities and problems which makes doing certain things like consistently meeting people hard. I feel forgotten by society, I struggle to make any sort of impact in this world, the only thing which I don't struggle with being poetry. I have had a profound love for creative writing, putting down fantastic descriptions to capture elusive experiences.\n\nI want to share that inner beauty with someone special. To be appreciated and to be given positive feelings to help inspire my work.\n\nI'm hesitant to talk here about my various disabilities. But like QUasimodo, I'm deaf (but with Cochlear Implants). I have a deep appreciation, love for the bells. The bells that sing in my heart and drive me to create, the bells people encounter in music, at night, in scenes of everyday life. They give the world a special color which rings throughout the world. \n\nI have had poor luck at meeting people in my area. At getting someone to be a new friend to me. I feel constantly outcompeted by everything that goes on around me. And my attempts to build connection haven't gone so great this past couple years. I tried getting close to some girls earlier in the year, but they stopped being my friend. \n\nI feel like I have a whole world to offer. But no one will know about that world of dreams unless they're able to get close and know the real me. \n\nI can't drive because my vision isn't so great. I am left wondering why not possessing this one skill leaves me so far behind in, well... Everything. I'm just an inconvenience. I feel so disconnected when I want nothing but that deep wonderful connection. \n\nI'm 30. there's so much missing in my life and so much in life that I'm missing out on. I've lost motivation with dating sites, I burned myself out on them all those times I felt myself in a lonely pit that I thought I could escape by just swiping through and matching with the right person. Turns out that the nature of online dating results in incredibly flakey communication, the 'next one is always better' attitude. \n\nI want to stop feeling bad about how lonely my life is. I have a rare chronic illness. Everything is this mad competition. I know that sometimes people wonder 'where are all the nice guys'? The really nice quiet guys don't know how to properly socialize with new people. At least I have issues with it due to my hearing and other stuff. \n\nLike just about every post a guy like me makes on this type of issue, I know this is a long shot. But as a great PE teacher once told me, \"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take\". So maybe someone here will realize that this is a good shot to take. To build a good, deep connection. \n\nCome, enter a world of wonder and fantasy. There aren't very many me's around.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I tried to make the most of it and enjoy the time, but it was like being on set of a porn movie.  i suggested we do our own thing, they enjoy their days, I enjoy mine doing my own thing, then we meet for dinner.  that wasn't acceptable.  he was a complete ass to me and then I heard him lying to her about me.  she never defended me and called me names - selfish, a liar for saying i can get along with people, that I ruined her time with this guy (she's 40 and he's 48 so too damn old for this). I left and did my own thing after two days of trying to come up with a compromise - I had a great time by myself and after he went home, we had a great time on what was left of our girls trip.  that was a month ago and she refuses to talk about it other than little jabs that everything was great until tuesday - uh, no it was not.  he was an ahole from the start and she let it keep going on.  i left in monday and she didnt even notice until Tuesday because they ditched me to go to dinner on monday and were quite proud of themselves for ditching me -- and apparently thought i wasn't serious when i said, i am not doing this, i am leaving.    anyway, when she makes a jab, i say lets talk about it, she says she doesn't want to.  The issue isn't that she lied to me about bringing this guy along, and the issue isn't that she has this new boyfriend that ignores everyone around her and so does she since this relationship The issue isn't that she has this new boyfriend, it is that she called me all kinds of horrible names and treated me like a leper and lied to me about bringing him along on a girls vacation - and Will not discuss it and certainly has never apologized. \n\nIt is not ok to call me names and be so awful to me, but I thought we could have a conversation - clearly we can't, which says to me, I do not value our friendship.  -- so this last Thursday I decided, I am done. but dang, it is painful.  this is someone i thought we'd be old grandma's together.  my sister friend.  suggestions on self talk that helps?  yes, i know, that's life, lives change, people find replacements, but it still hurts and I am still terribly sad", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

So later in the day, I told her bf that I understand I'd he might be upset but since I joke around a shit ton i obviously told him it was a joke knowing it wasnt her. But he got mad and shit so then the next day I send my occasional streaks to her and stuff but later on I see that she blocks me. I dont know if she blocked me or her bf blocked me since he has her snapchat. My intention to the joke was not to get her nudes. I think shes cute in her own way but I would never date her.       I'm shu because I got a speech impediment so I don't have many friends and I moved from a private school to a public school on my way to hig school. But what do I do? Was it my fault? I kinda dont like joking around all that much now becasue I dont want to accidentally lose my couple other friends. This is really hard on me.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

We\u2019re just plain acquaintances. Anyways, whenever he has his days off, he would come over to our house without any prior notice or phone call. He can be nice sometimes and we do enjoy his company but it gets extremely annoying when you have someone invite themselves over at least 3/4 times a week. \n\nThis is what usually happens: He would just show up at the door and enter without asking. Then after that, he will find something to eat and if there\u2019s no cooked food at the table, he will cook eggs without asking again and to make it worse, he won\u2019t ask if we want some. He will just eat the eggs by himself and doesn\u2019t care if we haven\u2019t eaten yet. He would also switch the TV channel without asking and he does it while I am still watching TV. How rude, right? He usually stays over until 10 PM. \n\nOnce, when we were grocery shopping(he tagged himself along), we went home a bit late, around 9 PM. He helped out a bit by carrying some grocery bags but he asked me to cook dinner for him immediately because it\u2019s getting late for him. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 I even remembered one another incident that he opened a bag of chocolates that me and bf bought without asking and he didn\u2019t ask again if we wanted some. He even complained that I didn\u2019t buy some corned beef and I bought fresh meat instead. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 Whenever he\u2019s here, our eggs are always getting emptied. Also, whenever the dinner is ready, he would eat first and doesn\u2019t care if other people haven\u2019t eaten yet. He does the dishes but it\u2019s not really cleaned properly so I had to wash them again. Ugh\n\nHe would also ask my boyfriend to fix his car for free and he has lots of demands and to make it worse, he would complain if he heard that my bf isn\u2019t working on to his car. He also called me average and when he\u2019s about to leave our house, he would just tell my bf goodbye and not me, despite of being aware that I was there. He even forgets to thank us for the kindness that we gave him. I feel I am being used, abusing my kindness and being taken advantage of. \n\nThe thing is, I wouldn\u2019t mind inviting him over, I just hate the fact how the thinks he like, lives here and come over whenever he likes. \n\nThe other thing is, he\u2019s really rude and inconsiderate. He doesn\u2019t mind making awkward comments and uncomfortable jokes. He just finished his temporary job already and I hate the fact that he would come over EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY like before. He\u2019s been like this for more than a year. \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\n\nIt may seem like I\u2019m letting him step all over me and my bf, but there is nothing else I can do. He\u2019s older than us and can get a lot of people to hate us especially me if I do anything wrong. \nAnyone have any advice? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 Sorry if this is long, it\u2019s just been bottled up inside me.

I think. \n\nFirstly, you need to know that until about a couple years ago we were both quite immature and very innocent, no heavy drinking or boy dramas. We come from pretty conservative families especially her, I'm indian and she's Afghan. \n \nBut recently we started partying and drinking very occasionally together- just innocent fun dancing etc lol. We always have a good time together. But in the last year she's been getting drunk with her Afghan friends  (who are instagram obsessed and always making sexual references and faces hahaha). \n\nShe's also been getting a lot of boy attention which at first i was so happy about for her but then she tells me how she doesn't want anything from them and that she'll end things. But from the messsges she sends it's obvious she leads them on. Basically, I think she's becoming a bit basic.  We don't talk about anything of substance but do talk about sensitive personal stuff sometimes. And she's unaware of current affairs.\n\nAlso, when we're together she's always checking her phone and it's gotten to the point where it makes me feel ignored. I think i must be too boring for her now! I've never shown her my disgust or disappointment when she tells me crazy shit she's done. So I thought she would at least still think im 'cool'. \n\nI think part of the solution is that i need more friends that i can clique with so that i don't rely solely on her for friendship. That way i can keep her in my life. \n\nAlso it is very hard to distance from her because we still talk regularly on fb and hang out (less often). Our families are pretty close and we've just been in each others lives for so long!!! I'm pretty upset about this but then i know I'm also lucky to have her because she's so caring for me.\n\nIf you made it this far thanks for listening \u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

And its been two yers since the three of us started hanging out, making us really close/ best friends. \"A\" lives about 30 minutes from me and \"B\" lives right up the street from me.\n\nOne weekend we decided to sleep over \"B's\" house (like we usually do), and the next morning \"A\" expressed that she needed to take her dog to groomers. \"B\" and I both offered to drive \"A\" to her house and to the groomers, but she rejected and said we'd go in her car.  When her dog is done, she drives us back to her house and me and \"B\" stay In the car. When she gets back in the car \"A\" is silent and then explains what happened inside of her house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFriend A : \"So my parents just talked to me, and they keep saying that they feel like you guys are using me. Every time we go somewhere, we are always in my car, and never in yours. Like right now, we took my car to take my dog to the groomers instead of going in one of yours. Its like you guys are wanting a free ride everywhere. And even when I got into a car accident, you guys never came to visit me. And I've been thinking, and I feel a little bit unapressiaged. I known that we all hung out all weekend for my birthday, but I was really expecting you guys to get me something. The price doesn't matter, but the fact that you guys didn't get me anything is what hurts me.

Plus it had only been two weeks since her birthday, and we are college students with tiny jobs, we we were really trying to save up to get her stuff.\n\n\"B\" and I explained all of this to her and the fact that there have been time where \"A\" has waited 6 moths  to get us anything for our birthday. I even explained to her how she completely forgot about my birthday until she saw an instagram post and then text \"where did you want to eat for your birthday\" and her reply was\n\n\" Ik i've waited that long to get you guys your give, but \"B\" and i's birthday a really close, so I thought that you guys should have gotten my stuff by now cause ints my birthday time and soon \"B's\" Birthday time.\n\n\"B\" and I talked several times after this about the whole situation. \"B\" also said that she talked about it with her boyfriend and said that she sounds materialist. So while we were out eating one day we expressed what we talked alone about the situations which was\n\n\" B and I have had so many major situations where our feeling were hurt by \"A\", but because she was our friend we let it go, but when it comes to her she feels \"unapressiatioed\" when we don't get her a give as soon as its her birthday. And if it was only two weeks after her bday and she feels that way, does it mean that she doesn't apreciated \"B\" and I because she waits so much longer. Also the fact that we known how opinionated she is about things, but as soon as her parents say something about us, she lets them talk, doest defend us at all and doesn't have anything thing to say she must think its true too. \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd her reply to this was that, her parents are really convincing and sometimes they get in her head to change her mind, she kept begging her sentences with \" I know you feel that way, but I only didn't that because...\" Basically excusing what she did and making it seem like she was sorry because we felt bad, but wouldn't change what she said/did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want peoples opinion on this situation", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

It's omgmobc.com, and there a few social flash games to play with random people on the internet. It's mildly difficult to play with the same person as there was no friend system at the time. So the first time I met this 17 yearold stranger, we had a a sick game of 3rd party tetris battle. She had a great sense of humor and she understood my meme persona. We stayed online for a good 4ish hours at first, said our goodbyes thinking we'd never talk again. About a week later, I happened to stumble upon her again and it was good greetings and played some games again. After that, we knew when we went online so that we get a chance to talk again. At some point, surprisingly nerve racking, we swapped numbers. 3 years later she's my closest friend, yet we've never met in person. Problem is that she lives in another state than I do and we dont have the money or resources to see each other. It's my dream and it's on my bucket list to go see her. We shared hardships, exuberance, and boredom all together over a simple phone. It makes me wonder how much of an impact she would have on me if I saw her physically than virtually. I need help to go see her but I have no idea what I could do to make it happen. If there's a good website for students opportunities in the states plus let me know.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I know alot of people on this sub always warn kids its most of the time the first comment wich i always feel really good about but you cant warn everyone, i also know that not everyone that comments on kids posts are creeps but it really just feels like they are because there are way more people that you could talk to that are your own age.\n\nI just wanted to adress some critisism that some people may have like why did the girl start talking to the guy in the first place: kids can be very na\u00efve i would know im one myself if i talk to someone a bit (this is for me i cant speak for other people) i easly trust them its just my nature, so some kids dont know any better they think people that dont ask for nudes in the first 30 seconds are good people wich is not the case alot of the time. I also want to say kids are not dumb when someone askes for a nude we know to block the person, alot of kids can be very smart and mature how they handle the situations and some of us know the ropes from being on reddit or other places for a while but some dont.\n\nAnother critisism that some people may have: ow why didnt she just report him. Well for one she didnt have any proof from the convos because she blocked him really quickly because, naturally she was scared and shaken up so she thought no one would believe her. At such a young age kids shouldnt be scared that no one would believe them they should automaticly feel the need to report them if other people even make them feel the slightest bit uncomfortable.\n\nJust another warning to kids dont talk to people that are 2 or 3 years older than you ecspecially guys.

She has a less than good home life, and I'm scared she's running away from it via marriage. I ran a background check on the guy via google, and he seems to have filed for bankruptcy a while back, but that's the only legal thing. The guy seems kinda pervy, but I can't decide if the \"this tree thicc\" memes on his Fb are complete jokes or if he's just that immature. She hasn't even gotten to college yet, and she could do so much better than getting hitched right away. Even if she wanted to marry away, why the 20 year age gap? like wtf? What can I do to help her? I'll always be there for her and I don't wanna get in the way of her happiness or drop out of nowhere to 'control' her life, but this seems like a terrible idea, and all of my alarm bells started ringing the second I realized what was happening.

You can use 2.7 grams of Os in AlCuLi or Al rails and with about 5-10 MW to the rails, you can easily shoot down Stinger drones and flak missiles. Only against railgun drones does this have a problem, and you can shoot these down with beryllium copper rails, usually with BeCu as the projectile. Also having a laser with Ti:Sapphire to shoot out the engines also helps to shoot down broadsider drones while shooting at it with the railguns. As for ships as targets, you can fire small boosted fission nukes or KKVs out of a cannon or even a coilgun. Also you can fire drones with methane or even hydrogen SCNTRs, and the drones can even fire KKVs of their own; the drone proper can be armed with cannon and an Os in AlCuLi railgun. When designing railguns, set the dimensions to be a corner case on the edge of three warnings: beam deflection stress or thermal expansion stress, projectile shatter and barrel burst. Barrel armor helps a lot to get rid of spread. I usually approach every scenario as precision combat, not shooting out the crew modules. Also, when designing cannon, you can increase the spread.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I wonder if I should keep [Children of a Dead Earth](https://www.reddit.com/r/COADE/) a secret, because it's a comment about abuse.

We\u2019ve had ups and downs but we\u2019ve been pretty much inseparable since we met. We\u2019ve been through fights but whether it be through talking it out or drunk texts at 3 in the morning we have ALWAYS made up.\n\nI thought she was going to be a bridesmaid at my wedding whenever it finally came around.\n\nThen J came into the picture.\n\nJ (23M) is an abusive prick. He of course didn\u2019t start out that way, but after about six or seven months of being together he has evolved into one of the most awful abusers I have ever seen in my life (which is saying something considering the shit I\u2019ve seen.)\n\nJ is a deadbeat. He barely has a job, barely has a car, and lives with his teenage girlfriend. He moved into K\u2019s place after getting kicked out of the place he WAS living in, which happened to be his ex girlfriend\u2019s house.\n\nI\u2019ve watched his abuse. I don\u2019t stand for it. And he doesn\u2019t like me because of this.\n\nAnd because he doesn\u2019t like me, he\u2019s decided that K shouldn\u2019t like me either and has instructed her that she is NEVER to be around me.\n\nWe said fuck that at first, but slowly but surely I\u2019ve begun losing contact with K. She doesn\u2019t text me as often, she doesn\u2019t call and check up on me when I post something worrying, she doesn\u2019t ask to hang out, she doesn\u2019t want to do anything when I ask if she wants to hang out.\n\nI tried calling her and she sent me to voicemail. I text her but I get left on read. Then, one fateful day when I got her to hang out, she said she had to go home and I heard her on the phone with J and J said \u201cI don\u2019t want you hanging around that bitch anymore\u201d and she didn\u2019t say a word in my defense.\n\nThe other day I made a joke on tiktok (call me cringey I already know) and she made a whole novel on Instagram about how the group I was \u201crepresenting\u201d was so annoying because of how they think they\u2019re \u201cbetter than everyone else\u201d and how they always have a stick up their asses. I made a joking comment on the post saying \u201cis this about my tiktok because it was a joke\u201d. She hopped on the defense and started insulting me, and then told me \u201cit\u2019s just my opinion don\u2019t get triggered bye\u201d and refused to talk to me for days. That was the last straw for me.\n\nK asked me if we weren\u2019t cool anymore because of the post she made yesterday. I finally let everything out and told her what I was upset about and why it was upsetting me, and if she was going to let J control her life I was finished and I wasn\u2019t going to associate myself with her anymore. This time I wrote the book, I told her why I was hurt and everything that led up to what I was saying, and she responded with \u201cOkay. Cool.\u201d\n\nShe has since then been rude to me in the groupchat we share with mutual friends. I was excited about something and she told me to shut the fuck up about it.\n\nBefore you say that she has no means of getting out of this relationship and that\u2019s why she continues to let it happen: she does have a way out. We\u2019ve talked about it before. He lives in her house and she could say one word to her father and he would be OUT. No more contact, no more having to deal with the physical, mental, and emotional abuse. She could be free so easily but she refuses to because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t like to be the one to end things\u201d. \n\nTL;DR: my best friend of 11 years has let an abusive relationship take over her entire life and now she\u2019s being a bitch to me because I\u2019m done picking up the pieces if she\u2019s just going to shatter it all over again.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for getting through a best friend breakup?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

If you decide to read this I am very grateful.\n\nSo one of the problems I have is the following: When I am in a situation with other people( talking, playing something, etc.) it can happen that after that when I am alone and start to think I overthink everything I did or said. It's like this one situation that I should have not done or should have done differently is rotating in my head and feels like it's the end of the world. It can get as bad as me having this stress and pressure feeling in my chest and tummy, and breathing heavier. This can happen either directly after a - let's call it -  \"dumb situation\" but also when I am showering for example and think about something that happened in the past which made me feel super uncomfortable or awkward. It is very difficult to deal with this because it causes unnecessary stress for me . I cant let things go that easily. They always follow me.\n\nI often see myself as a \"victim\" that attracts all the bad , stressful , uncomfortable  situations.

We hung out all the time and have talked about most things in our lives. She was there for me during my lowest points of my life and I did the same for her. She even considered me her little therapist since she\u2019d always tell me about her problems. I was always there for her while she was kind of there for me (sometimes was and other times unhelpful tbh). \n\nSo going back to Late February/Early March, everything seemed great until the last time we met up. We went to the gym and then shopped around for a bit, we talked and nothing seemed off. She said that she would text me when we separated but then never did. I tried contacting her for days but she never got back to me, but when she did she simply send a \u201c?\u201d. I called a few times but nothing seemed to be happening so I just stopped. It hurt in the inside for months as I didn\u2019t know what I did. I figured she was going through something as she deactivated her insta and then came back but I didn\u2019t push. I honestly don\u2019t know what I could have done to have her just ghost me. She still talks to a mural friend of ours which hurt me but there\u2019s nothing I can really do so I gave her some space. \n\nSo here comes July and I\u2019m planning to go to six flags with two of my other friends (who she doesn\u2019t particularly like but can be friendly with) and I wanted to text her to see if she\u2019d like to come. Before being ghosted we talked about going together to the same amusement park but nothing ever came of it because of our busy schedule. I want to text her but I\u2019m just scared of her straight up telling me to stop texting her or just keep ignoring me. I have abandonment issues and anxiety so I don\u2019t know what to do.

Ever since I was a kid everyone in my family let me know that I would probably end up bald too. But everyone also told me that there would be some way that technology and science would fix all that by the time I become an adult.\n\nAll of this wasn\u2019t such a big issue for me until like high school which was when I started balding. 5 years later it\u2019s gotten much worse and while I know there are options for me to take to keep my hair, it just seems so defeating and none of it is permanent to my knowledge. I can\u2019t afford to continuously have treatments like other people can.\n\nI\u2019ve become severely depressed from the last couple of years and my rapid hair loss and have kind of given up hope. All throughout college I was so self conscious and nervous that I rarely went out and did excited things. Now looking back on pictures I feel sostupid because if I had that hair now, I would feel so much better and like I had all the confidence in the world. I really feel like I missed out on a lot of opportunities and am having a hard time coping with that. Not really sure where to go from here because I really feel like I\u2019m at a dead end. \n\nThanks for reading.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I wear my heart on my sleeve and have always embraced that. But recently I\u2019ve been told I jump to conclusions so quick that it made me uncomfortable to speak up again. \n\nI\u2019m a full time college student who works a full time job. So I pretty much permanently live an hour away from my hometown. I not only juggle this but a relationship as well. On top of all this I also struggle with anxiety and depression. Despite handling my life pretty well sometimes I feel very overwhelmed by everything. \n\nFor the last couple of weeks I\u2019ve been feeling unimportant and unwanted by those around me. I realized I can\u2019t assume to be asked out all the time so I took initiative and began asking everyone to hang out. Without exaggeration 9/10 times I get rejected. \n\nExample 1: \nI invited two friends for coffee and they said no we\u2019re already grabbing coffee together somewhere else. I respected their plans and didn\u2019t make a big deal about it. \nBut just a couple of days ago I pitched the idea of getting ice cream. Neither one got back to me and instead went to grab ice cream without me. \n\nNow in my hometown I have a couple of friends I\u2019m very close to. Of course the distance kind of made us drift apart but we\u2019re still fairly close. Last week I noticed they began hanging out with a third person. I thought it was cool and was happy for them. But now I\u2019m beginning to see them act differently towards me. \n\nExample 2: \nI wanted to make plans with them on Monday (one of my days off). Little did I know they had already planned to go out and when I hinted I wanted to join one completely ignored me while the other said next time. \n\nOne of the two friends from back home  retweeted something that has really upset me. The tweet was about how one friend does all the work while the other leaves her hanging. I couldn\u2019t help but feel like this was targeted at me. \n\nThis is my first reddit post and I don\u2019t know exactly what I\u2019m asking for. I just wanted some feedback and somewhere to rant.

She left dead things in front of his house as revenge. She told me to never pass out in front of them again. She insists she asked her friend\u2019s friend (who she trusted very much about it ) and came to the conclusion he was just being drunk and stupid. But I asked her about it and she lied to me. How should I feel? She\u2019s my best friend. We\u2019re probably soul sisters but that really pissed me off and I kind of hate her now :/ thoughts ? In the past she ensured guys wouldn\u2019t take Advantage of me and got so pissed off at them so it just doesn\u2019t make sense", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I am in college out of state and come home every summer. My friend \\[20M\\] lives at home and going to college nearby so I only see him on breaks or during the summer but we were in the same friend group in high school and were pretty good friends before I left. I met him for dinner last week and the whole time he talked about his very specific interests (car repairs and space exploration) in great detail for two hours. I listened and asked questions because what's important to him is important to me after all but anytime I spoke he acted as if I just said the dumbest thing in the world. When I tried to share my stories about my friends from college, he acted incredibly uninterested and even said that since college I had become \"the most typical blonde sorority girl.\" I think this is hardly true but it hurt having him so disinterested by me and stories that I wanted to share with him. All in all, I felt really awkward during the whole thing and when we were leaving, he brought up how everyone thought we were gonna get together in high school and how one time we \\~almost\\~ hooked up after prom. I laughed it off because it was always a joke between us and the friend group but he kept pushing the subject on the drive home. Since then he has asked me to get dinner or go to movies almost every night but between work and other fiends I've been busy and a little avoiding him. We've been friends for so long I don't want to cut him out but he is giving me the most mixed signals. I can't tell if he actually likes hanging out with me or he just wants someone to listen to him talk? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: My \\[20M\\] friend only wants to talk about his interests, doesn't listen to anything I say, and keeps bring up how we almost got together in high school.

However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03. If you going to message me I recommend you being around my age at least 18-26. Nobody younger or older to chat with cause I feel it would be awkward lol. I can make some exceptions. \n\nImportant, don't bother sending me a message if your just going to ghost. It really hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Also I  don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again. It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have a Kik, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now. Until we get to know each other more. I prefer the pm message box and not the chat but whatever works for you. So yeah just msg me your age, gender, and a little bit about yourself so I know you read all this lol.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Told almost no one about his treatment towards me. I had the brilliant idea to still be friends with him. But I feel guilty. For ALL of my friends, I defend and have kind words to say about them.

I had issues with a certain drug that is very accessable in my state, and my parents caught me. It was a shit show, as I was self medicating in order to deal with shitty emotions I was going through. After being caught, my parents had the dumbass move to keep me at home and not allow anyone to visit me for two weeks. Isolation is the worst punishment possible for someone who is self medicating. After New year's, I made the decision to literally throw away all my substances and not self medicate. That ended really fast. \nI've had (and still have) incredibly easy access to it as of the last 4-5 weeks since school was getting out. At the same time, My girlfriend of more than a year broke up with me, and it was for the fully legitimate reason of: I had become so distant to her it felt more like we were friends than in a relationship. The break up just fully settle in, and my suicidal thoughts have been through the roof over the last 2 days. I've totally fucked up my sleep schedule in the last week, and have been eating/hydrating less and less. In the past, even with my substances abuse, depression, bottling up emotions, and faking being happy to not be a downer to be around, I've always told myself that I would be too much of a pussy to kill myself. I knew I'd be unable to do it. Since these thoughts kicked up again, it scares me that the idea of doing it feels tangible. Like it's only a couple of days away from happening. \n*HERE IS THE CATCH* I'd like to not kill myself. I truly don't want to. I've had other friends on the verge who I've personally gone to great lengths to prevent, and i know how much it fucking hurts to think about the loss of a friend or family member. I want to talk to people, but I don't want people to try to make me feel better. I want a friend to relate with, someone who understands what I'm going through, and maybe someone with similar interests that we could bond over. I've had a few long distance friends in the past, and I wouldn't be opposed to someone new to text, talk to, or bond with. If anyone is out there right now, dm me. I'll give you my snap.

We have had a long history (the leaders) and have come away with several relationships that have lasted a long time. Most of us just chat when we have time and want to talk, and we talk about various things. Some subjects that come to mind: banter, our daily lives, politics, and real world stuff in general. We are all very diverse of interest, and all of us are active (we remove inactive people, who don't invest time.) I would say we have a good split of US and EU people, as well as a nice spot of Australians/SEA , and also Men/Woman ratio.\n\nWhat we're looking for is genuine people, who want to make long lasting friendships. The type of person who comes in to the chat and interacts with us, not just posts a meme and leave. If you're shy, socially awkward, we get it. We will allow you time to open up, and none of us are very judge-y. If you're coming in to this community, get ready to explore a world of genuine people with real thoughts and feelings, this is not a meme fest, although it can be. We have several channels and topics of discussions going on, and we're quite active as a rule - politics, not safe, selfies, introductions etc. Introducing yourself and showing yourself are highly encouraged, though not mandatory.\n\nIdeally you will be:\n\n\\- Honest (I do not want meme personalities or personas here. If you have crippling depression we get it, but be yourself.)\n\n\\- Interactive\n\n\\- Willing to voice chat sometimes or be very text-active\n\n\\- Authentic\n\n\\- Be looking for real friends from real people\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: If you only play games, it's likely not a great fit - this is a \\*social community\\* where you talk and make friends.

She was 21 at the time and I was 20. She was in the phase of wanting to hook up with guys so even though we were in a foreign country, she'd use a dating app and got a date with someone. I was okay with that because I'm more of a morning person and she's not, so while she was on her date, it'd give me the time to go to sleep early and wake up early and go see some things in the morning (i love sightseeing and just walking around by myself). It was a win-win situation.\n\nBut then she got a bit scared and wanted me to go with her, which I was against because:\n\na) we only had one key for the place we were staying at so if she stayed with him after i left, i'd have to wait for her to come home so i could open the door for her or wake up in the middle of the night\n\nb) i don't like thirdwheeling and i was tired\n\nBut she was talking to a friend on a phone about this date and she said that she was afraid but I didn't want to go with her. Basically she guilt tripped me into going with her and I was gonna just stay 5 minutes so I could see if he was okay guy but then she made me stay with them, even bought me a drink. We were at a park with our drinks, sitting down on the bench and talking when suddenly she went away a few meters to smoke, leaving me and the guy sitting far apart on the bench. She gave the vibe that she wasn't interested and the guy asked me a few questions that I answered and we had a short talk, I asked about some sights or local's opinion. Then I left quite quickly. I waited until 2am for her to come home and I was quite worried + tired at that time but she seemed to have a good time with him so I didn't start anything, I was happy nothing happened to her at the first place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to a few weeks after the trip she suddenly starts accusing me of 'stealing her guy'. I told her it wasn't the case and that she dragged me along but she wasn't having any of it and we kinda stopped hanging for a while but then in the summer it was okay, we went partying twice and the second time we were staying at her place (us + another friend) and after we came from the party she started accusing me again to the point that I was ready to leave in the middle of the night and walk about 20km back to my home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to beginning of this year we go shopping (we met once or twice before and it was normal, no shit about this guy) and I was sure we were okay + she had a boyfriend for half a year so I say something along how stupid/funny it was of us to fight about that vacation guy and she said I better not talk about it or she'll be mad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My friend guilt tripped me into accompanying her to a date with a stranger on a vacation and when she basically ignored him, i had a small talk with him.

So they booked her a ticket to fly with them, without even letting my friend know ahead of time.\n\nThe problem is - we've always considered this \"our\" trip. One of the only times we can truly catch up. I love her girlfriend, but we both agreed that it should be our time, without any partners with us. Plus, my friend lives with her gf and sees her 24/7, and my friend was looking forward to having some space. I'm also not fully comfortable with her, just because I don't know her as well and I'm really shy. The gf is very understanding of the situation, so she agreed to give us space on the trip. But both me and my friend are still really sad that this one time we get to see each other, it won't just be the two of us (plus her family, but it's still usually just the two of us hanging out).\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to make this a little easier?

New to the world of Reddit and to the world of internet friends.\n\nLife's gotten really lonely and I read that I can make some new friends here on Reddit, so here I am giving it a shot. I started off as an international student here in the US. I now work in the same city I studied in and everyone I was friends with at the university has left and it's been about 5 years since I've had a chance to meet family. I've had a chip on my shoulder that I needed to prove it to my society back home that I'm worth something, just wanted to be accepted. So I've been focused on goals and achievements and career and haven't been able to make time for people. Awards, plaques, fame, got all of that but I don't have anyone to share all the happiness with. I now have the validation from people back home, but I have zero friends where I live. Life's been pretty shitty over the past few years. While I have to keep hustling due to circumstances, I can't deal with the loneliness anymore. Would to love to get to know people and share stories.\n\nInterests:\n\n1. **Memes:** I love memes. I started off as a \"meme-dealer\" to people I know and have now graduated to become a Meme lord. Lol.\n2. **Photography**: I love photography. I don't have proper gear so I just click pictures on my phone. Love putting them through Lightroom because phone-cameras don't do justice to what eyes can see.\n3. **Gym**: The Gym is my only \"Me-time\". I love spending time at the gym but I am a vegetarian and don't get eat enough protein. Those of you that spend time at the gym and are fit AF, massive respect to you all! People like you inspire me to keep at it, gains or not.\n4. **Tv**/**Movies**: I love to watch a bunch of Tv shows. I sadly don't have much time these days, so I usually do reruns of Friends, That 70s Show, Anime, and other old sitcoms when I'm home so that it feels less lonely. Lol. Just finished watching Stranger Things S03.\n5. **Places**/**Cultures**: I love getting to know about other places in the world. I watch a lot of videos on Youtube, lately a bunch of them about places/history/culture. I love the show The Amazing Race, I get to see places that I can never go to. I've been in the US for a while but the American culture is still kinda daunting for someone like me to just go out and make friends at random. Teaching myself Spanish because I just like to learn the language. I don't have anybody around to practice it with though.\n6. **Coffee**: Lived off of coffee in grad school. Used to consume an unhealthy amount of caffeine on a daily basis. Cutting down.\n7. **Marketing/Business/Entrepreneurship:** I some day want to start a business of my own so I like to learn and follow what others do out there.\n8. **Technology**: I love reading about new tech, mobile phones, mostly.\n9. **Football**: It's been a shitty past few seasons, but....\\*Glory Glory Man United\\*\n\nand so on...\n\nEnough of me rambling. If you're having a great day, do share! Shitty day? Happy to be a listener. I don't have any gender/location/age preferences, just want to make friends who I can open up to. If you can relate to any of the above, PM! :)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

She's normally been a chill person but does have a dark side to her. However, she and I have never had a serious fight/drama. A couple of years ago, she also came out as polyamorous and is now dating two men separately while still dating/hooking up with randos. Despite my personal feelings on the matter, I supported her like any friend would.\n\nBut in the last couple months she's seemed off. I went to the beach with another friend, and she sent me a text saying \"Gee thanks for the invite.\" I said it was last minute, plus her work schedule usually makes her work weekends. I told her to let me know next time she's free so we could do another beach day to make it up. She never responded. \n\nThen I went on a boat cruise for a night, and I heard from another friend she was ticked off I didn't invite her. Then last night was one of her bf's birthday parties. But he lives far away and the weather was really bad rain all day so I was too scared to drive and had to back out last minute. I politely told both her and her bf over text but neither responded.\n\nThen this morning, she posts on Facebook, \"I need new friends.\" I screenshot it and asked her what was up. No response all day. \n\nI talked to a close friend who knows this friend and told her that I think the post is about me. My close friend told me all this stuff about how the other friend has been upset with me over the beach, boat ride, and probs now the party. \n\nI have already reached out and given this friend ample time to contact me and yet she never has. I've decided that if she doesn't respond to my text by tomorrow then our nearly 10 year friendship is over. I'm in my mid-twenties and have no time for high school pettiness. It especially disappointed me that she'd take this to social media instead of being an adult and coming to me about things.\n\nA part of me is sad, of course, because of our history and similar backgrounds, but I guess that's how life goes...true colors sometimes take longer than expected to show.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

She\u2019s a lesbian and I\u2019ve dated girls before but am currently with a guy of 8 years. She\u2019s dated girls while we were friends and I\u2019ve been jealous but I was never clear about it and whenever she tried to talk about it I would shut down.\n\nShe\u2019s been on and off with this girl for almost a year now and I really don\u2019t like her, not because I\u2019m jealous anymore (I\u2019ve been working on that), but because this girlfriend of hers emotionally abuses her. Treats her like garbage. For example, my friend has a son and he was in the hospital over the weekend. I heard the girlfriend ran off kayaking and going out to the bar with her friends instead of going to the hospital to be there with them. \n\nOn Fourth of July, we all got together for a bbq. I knew the girlfriend was going to be there. My goal was to be mature and just enjoy myself and not start any BS so everyone could just have a good time. I thought I did great...so great that I was so proud of myself and after I left, I went home to journal about what a nice day we had together.\n\nWhen I got home, I texted my friend and said I got home safe and I had a great time and it was like having a family day again (I call family days times when we all get together and do stuff) and she text me back \u201cwhy did you act like that towards my gf?\u201d\n\nSo I got defensive because I didn\u2019t think I was rude to the girlfriend. I said \u201cwhat do you mean? I said hi and bye. Can you be a little more clear because I don\u2019t think I was rude\u201d\n\nI have an iPhone so I could see she started to type and then she stopped. \n\nAnd that triggered me to fly into a rage. I started accusing her gf of making her do this, I said a bunch of things like she\u2019s intimidated of me, she was mad cause I was playing with the son the whole time, I don\u2019t have feelings for you so she has nothing to worry about\u201d and I went on and on all night. I was really upset. It\u2019s like all my emotions spewed out at once. \n\nShe posted an article on fb about what real friends are afterwards.\n\nI waited a day and texted \u201care u gonna tell me how I was rude\u201d and she didn\u2019t answer. The next day I said I didn\u2019t appreciate being ignored and accused her gf of making her ignore me. Then I told her I found out her son was in the hospital and I\u2019m sorry I thought she was avoiding me. Still nothing.\n\nI finally smoked some weed and realized maybe I did overrreact so I texted her that too and still got no answer. She hasn\u2019t deleted me from social media or blocked me (she usually does that to people when she\u2019s pissed with a capital p). \n\nSo now I\u2019m thinking maybe she really doesn\u2019t care, maybe she just needs time. And then another part of me is thinking maybe she is mad at me, but why can\u2019t we talk about it? We\u2019re both 28 years old this isn\u2019t high school.\n\nOpinions and advice desperately needed please!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We thought she had paperwork in already and was just waiting to get ship out to training, yet we found out the day she move in that she fail the ASVAB and has to wait a month to retake it, she has not retaken it yet. She has a two year old which is why we let her move in. My wife has a full time job, we didn\u2019t go to college, but our jobs give us enough income to live a decent life. We have a 5month baby, he friend has a college degree, \u201clooking for a job\u201d for two years now and can\u2019t find anything so she says. This is why she decided to join the army because there is no jobs out there yet Amazon is always hiring which is where my wife been working for the last 6 years. Her friend doesn\u2019t want to work because when you need money you work anywhere doesn\u2019t matter the working conditions especially when you have a child who needs food and clothes. She been getting help from the gov, I don\u2019t know how much money they give her, but we never see the money because she doesn\u2019t pay rent, utilities or even groceries. She does helps out with chores which is a big help, reason why we allowed her to keep staying here, but yesterday she bought a decor and hang it up without asking for permission. My wife did get upset because she had plans for that wall, but didn\u2019t say anything to her. My problem is that if she hanging decor already then she thinks this is her place because you don\u2019t hang decor unless you plan on staying for a long time. She been her for 6 months already and it has suck because we both don\u2019t get home until 6pm which gives her friend a house to herself all day. I get home from work and she is always in the living room acting like if it\u2019s her place, I always get stuck going to my room because she won\u2019t leave the living room. We give her website where she can rent rooms for single moms, but she always makes an excuse like they don\u2019t have any around where we live or that it\u2019s too expensive. I\u2019m getting tired of getting home and see her acting like it\u2019s her place and moving things around. My wife does see it\u2019s a problem, but since she has a child she doesn\u2019t want to throw her out, but we already help her enough and she is well educated to find a job. I feel like I\u2019m being an evil person for wanting to kick her out, but we are not her parents and it\u2019s not our responsibility to have to help her out this long. I feel like a bad person telling my wife we are being taken advantage off and that it\u2019s time to cut the friend out her life. It\u2019s not the first time my wife been taken advantage by this friend, but now that she has a child it makes my wife vulnerable and she gives in. I don\u2019t want to have them living place to place either because of her baby boy, we are always thinking about her baby being taken away and put into foster care. I just want to know if I\u2019m a bad person and need to stop and just help her friend out  or if it\u2019s time we cut her out.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

{"post_id": "capk6e", "created_utc": 1562613585, "title": "Ending a Friendship (which used to be amazing)?", "author": "ayooitsayoo", "self_text": "Hello all-I would like your opinion and views.\n\nAlmost 10 years ago, I met a friend in grad school - we quickly became very close, shared mutual friends, traveled the world, and had lots of fun. After grad school, we stayed very close. She soon moved to the city where I lived. At that time, she had a boyfriend (who I didn't like very much but was diplomatic with) and would limit the time we'd socialize. That annoyed me. But I was understanding. She would often ignore mutual friends and not socialize with them because her rich boyfriend didn't \"approve\" of them (i.e. they were too poor or had no status). But in all fairness, she always took time to spend with me. One summer, the two of us took a girls' trip to the beach. I was going thru a very difficult time because my parents were thinking of divorcing. When I shared my concerns with my friend, she brushed them off and I felt she wasn't supportive. On top of it, she continued to focus the conversation on her boyfriend and why he wasn't marrying her, etc. I felt terribly disappointed after this trip. And alienated by the lack of sympathy for my problem. During the trip, I made some comments regarding her boyfriend (true facts which made her uncomfortable). She then emailed me a few days after the trip to ask me why I was making \"digs\" at her - I had had enough by then and told her to not worry about it. I hoped that she would understand my frustrations with her self-centered behavior and just let me off in this case, especially since I was very much down and out due to the situation with my parents. Alas, she did not and from that point on she took intense, vindictive measures to ignore me, exclude me from social situations with mutual friends, etc.\n\nA few months later, she reached out and we met up. She confronted me on \"our issues\" - and I ended up explaining why I was harsh with her. She, on the other hand, didn't address any of her behavior, which I thought was telling. We ended up hugging it out but I confronted her later that night via text on her exclusionary and vindictive behavior. Once again, she didn't address it and simply ignored me. I was beyond frustrated. That was in the summer - fast forward to the winter, and I had had more unpleasant outcomes thanks to her influencing other friends against me and excluding me from activities. I was in a terrible state of emotional health due to these things as well as the on-going saga with my parents. I ended up suffering from intense panic attacks (something I'd never experienced before) and spending a night at the emergency room, my heart doing crazy things! It was a scary time. It took me months to recover my physical well-being after that ER incident.\n\nIn the context of my shaky health, I felt like the \"bigger\" person and reached out to her, simply telling her I loved her very much as a friend and how much I value our relationship after everything had happened. She took her time to reply and said that she had to \"think a long time\" about whether to reply to me. I found that strange, since it was her actions which prompted my behavior and she still never once addressed her behavior, her coldness, and her retaliatory tactics. In any case, I was in a vulnerable state when I reached out and so, we ended up seeing each other once again, maybe 6 or 7 months after the last time we had seen each other. Things started off well. I wanted to be tolerant, careful, and loving. And forgiving. I hoped she would be the same, and she appeared to be -- but there were always little comments and actions she made, which made me think there were some issues still bubbling under the surface. She was growing increasingly disaffected with her relationship - the fancy boyfriend still hadn't proposed and I could tell this was occupying her mind, day and night. We hung out from time to time, nothing too intense or close like before, and one day, I saw her and she told me she had broken up with the boyfriend (after 6 years, and she was already 35). I felt terrible, especially since I wasn't there for her during the break-up. So we began hanging out a little bit more. She invited me to her birthday party and I was so happy to attend with my boyfriend - but she was once again totally self-absorbed and wanted me to wingman her with a good male friend of mine (who she had badmouthed and looked down upon when she was dating the fancy guy). I did my best to be a supportive wingwoman. She ignored me demonstratively after I had served my purpose at the party and even left my BF and I to walk way behind her and the rest of the party as we switched venues, without waiting for us. I felt really disrespected. Once again, I felt she hadn't truly forgiven me - and for what!?\n\nAfter that, a month later, she was still obsessed with rebounding with the good male friend of mine - and they decided to organize a summer beach house outing. I said I would be down with going, but alas, I couldn't make it in the end because I had family visiting the labor day weekend. I told her this and she completed ignored me from that point on.\u00a0\n\nIt was over a year that we didn't speak...after the beach house incident.\n\nA few months ago, around the new year, I received a text message with a photo of her and another good friend. This \"good friend\" I had been very close with - we were all like the 3 musketeers, but as my relationship with the friend in question deteriorated, I felt this \"good friend\" get pulled and manipulated to her side. They would go on vacations together and hang out, and totally ignore me. So when I saw this photo, I felt hurt, of course - the \"good friend\" was visiting my friend in OUR city, and neither of them bothered to include me or ask me out for a coffee, but they did feel the need to demonstrated that they were together. I should have told them off but I, once again, wanted to be the \"bigger person\", so of course, I was nice and reached out to them both. I ended up seeing my friend a few weeks later - it had been over a year. I found her completely different. The break-up with the fancy boy must've really hit her hard, because all of her arrogance and mean-girl bluster had gone. She was a little boring and was hanging out with people she used to bad-mouth and think lower than the dirt on her shoes. I found this highly hypocritical but I also realized that she was going through a hard time - she even mentioned she was freezing her eggs now, etc. I really felt bad. I thought life had finally taught her humility and YET - she still had the energy to make little digs and comments at me. I couldn't believe it. I left the outing feeling annoyed beyond belief but also feeling sad for her.\n\nA few weeks later, I invited her out to join me and one of my girlfriends for drinks - I extended the invite a few days beforehand. She ignored it completely. And replied on the night OF the outing. I felt disrespected once again, and didn't even read her reply. A few weeks later, I decided to invite her to my birthday night out. She once again, ignored my email and then replied only ON the day of my bday outing, saying she'd be there. I was actually so happy she'd make it! When she got there, she arrived with some female friend I was not acquainted with, sat down at the bar away from everyone else, and didn't say anything to me except a quick happy bday. It was demonstrative and I felt both myself and my guests disrespected. She ended up leaving an hour later.\u00a0\n\nA few weeks after that, she invites me out to a concert with another girl from our grad school who recently had just moved to our city. This girl (let's call her \"Gigi\"), used to lust after my friend's fancy ex-boyfriend. And my friend would look down at her as the biggest loser and piece of trash, calling her Gigi the Whore. She wouldn't be caught dead hanging out with her. And now, I see them hanging out - very odd. Anyway, I, yet again, put on my big girl panties and accept the concert invitation. I am at the venue on time and then get an email saying that my friend and Gigi are \"on their way\" - they had done something together, before the concert, excluding me. I wouldn't have thought anything of this in normal circumstances, but I certainly DID read into this due to my friend's exclusionary actions. Anyway, the concert went OK, but I noticed several times Gigi making little comments / digs at myself and my male friend (the one my friend wanted to rebound with and who had no interest in her and had left her hanging with a bill of 10,000$ for the beach house situation). They'd exchange little looks when I'd say something. Very annoying. After all, this Gigi I pretty much didn't know nor had never hung out with (and would make fun of).\n\nA few days later, I decided to invite my friend and Gigi to a music festival. My friend replied immediately that she was in. Gigi ignored me. I emailed my friend to ask her if she was game to go to the festival with me, just the two of us. I expressed my desire to finally spend some quality 1 on 1 time with her. I felt that'd be important for our friendship. She agreed. A few days later, I wanted to organize a happy hour with my friend, a few other mutual friends, and the male-friend she wanted to rebound with a year ago (she was mad at him for stiffing her during the beach house incident); I thought I'd play peacemaker between her and my male-friend. She declined both invitations for the happy hour I tried to organize for 2 different weeks. As the festival was fast approaching also, I emailed her to ask her if she was still game for the festival - she waited ONE WEEK to reply that yes, she was game. And I replied to her that that's great, and that she should check the weather because it might rain on the day we'd want to go (which was a smart move, since the festival actually ended up getting cancelled that day)...and I added to this email a note that I didn't want to force her to hang out with my male-friend and that if she was uncomfortable with getting drinks or socializing with him (I assume due to his rejection of her romantic overtures), that she should just let me know. And well - she totally ignored this last email....and the day of the festival arrived. And she never got back to me. Once again, I couldn't believe this!!! This was the last straw for me. I felt like I was dealing with a mentally unstable person going through something. Her mother is actually quite mentally unstable and the ex-fancy boyfriend asked her if her mom would have to be \"part of our lives\" if they ended up getting married. I guess he saw a lot of the mom in my friend and decided to call it quits. And I just couldn't handle this treatment anymore.\n\nA few weeks later, and this is quite recent, a mutual friend was visiting in town. She invited myself, my friend, and one of the low-as-dirt \"new\" friends my pal had adopted as fillers, to dinner. I couldn't handle hanging out with the latter 2, so I told my visiting-friend that I was busy with work and declined her dinner invitation directly. The night of the dinner, I get a text from my friend - she says \"oh hey, there's might have been some miscommunication but we're going to so-and-so place for dinner, you should come!\" Why did she text me? My visiting-friend told me that my friend would be the one organizing the dinner (she loves the sense of control and power), so of course, I realized that she must be flexing her little control skills in that moment. Alas, she didn't know that I had already declined the outing and wasn't planning on going. I thought hard about what to write back - but at the end, I just ignored the text.\n\nAnd so - this is where this annoying, tortuous saga is at the moment. I have a feeling that I will soon be receiving an invite to attend my friend's birthday party. I would like to use the occasion to reply with a final GOODBYE to her and end this toxic friendship (which used to be the best friendship I ever had years ago). Should I be hard-line and get some revenge and finality out of this? What do you think??", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I also cannot stand small talk and generic, meaningless messages. \n\nI have Discord, but for the first while I\u2019d prefer Reddit PMs in order to get to know one another.

Currently on break from college for the summer so I've too much free time. I'm pretty into science (studying to be a biologist) so if you are too we'd probably have lots to talk about. I don't like burdening people with my problems but I'm really good at listening to yours. Tbh I care too much for others sometimes. But I guess caring for others isn't the worst trait to have.

One the basic ones would be something 25+ in age. I just feel more comfortable speaking to someone closer to my age range, after that I don\u2019t have a huge care in who you are. \n\nI\u2019ve had a mixed results type of bag from making friends here, like anyone else who has used these subs for what they are actually intended for. I think the longest friendship I had with someone online has been 3 years, I still speak to them semi regularly but of course life changes and new things come into play and whilst I care them a lot, I find myself needing something to talk to more regularly. I find online friends for me work well for what I need, I\u2019ve never had a big desire to hang out with people, I am very much a homebody and the time I do like to get out of the house is always with my wife and two children. \n\nHaving told all my friends I made in high school to go jump in the lake so to speak was perhaps a big mistake on myself but hey I can\u2019t change what I did, all I know was trying to make friends after I left high school was kinda damn hard. I have my wife\u2019s friends and they are cool, I get along with them but they aren\u2019t really \u201cmy\u201d friends and I certainly don\u2019t message them to just talk. Anymore more about me. \n\nI\u2019m into my video games of course, I can play almost anything. Recently I went into a big final fantasy binge and replayed FFX and I am about to start FFIX, whilst I\u2019m also playing judgement, so I like to start and drop games a lot. My gaming time has obviously been cut short now because I have kids so I mainly just play whatever I feel like once the kids have go to sleep and I\u2019ve spent time with my wife. \n\nI have a big obsession with *anything* paranormal and the occult, even right down to just reading various kind of topics on it on reddit and then starting to google things that catch my interest. I love tattoos and have some, I very much love black American traditional style and have started my own and am looking to add to it. \n\nI am also similarly obsessed with space. I am not that terribly smart so a lot of my obsession just comes from looking at space pictures and I watch planet size comparisons on YouTube almost weekly and freak myself out with the scope and how vast the universe is. I like to daydream a lot about space, similarly any space related media I just devour, from doing nothing but talking pictures in no mans sky to watching interstellar for the 35th time. \n\nI have no real big obsession with tv shows or anything of the like, I\u2019ve come to find myself browsing Netflix for 42mins before I just watch the same things I always watch, I know what I\u2019m getting right?\n\nOne big recent change in my life is I have taken steps to get my social anxiety into order. I am going for my first session sometime soon, I\u2019m literally making the phone call today to set it up. I think this has spurred on my interest in talking to someone, being able to share my experiences with this world, which is very foreign to me. I am happy to talk via reddit or I use discoed, also lastly I am obsessed with audioslave. I am listening to them as I type this.

She asked to be roommates within a few days of us messaging, idk i knew she was special. I was so so so excited to meet her, we texted every day from February 2018 until we met in August of 2018. We were really good roommates, absolutely best friends. We were never awkward, it's like we were immediate bff's right when we met. We made really good memories together. We tried making other friends but we kinda mutually decided we really liked just hanging out with each other. From the second week of living and hanging out with her, I knew I liked her a bit too much. But I tried to hide it. I tried dating other people, making other friends. Both of which I did but I really didn't have as good of a time than when I was with her, she was always on my mind. I was always looking forward to the next time we would smoke or just see each other. We became very close to being just friends (were both bisexual girls btw). We cuddled, spooned, kissed occasionally on the cheek (when drinking) and talked about living together and getting married at 30 (well she changed to 27 because she said she wants kids) if we were both single. I truly saw no flaw in this girl, she dreamed of living in Australia and my god I was ready to move across the world and deal with Australia's terrifying bugs/animals because this girl is just .. WOW. I thought about confessing my love to her and some times planned on it. Especially when i thought her glance would linger a bit longer in my eyes. or she would declare that we were soulmates. I was so so grateful to have gone to the same university and be born around the same time to where she was brought into my life. I was convinced she was my wife. It felt destined to be. It felt right. But I wasn't going to tell her that. All through the first and part of the second semester, I had kept my secret sealed shut. But then at the end of March 2019, we decided to get dressed up all fancy and see Shrek the Musical at a local high school, BUT we're gonna drink a few Four Lokos. We thought we were funny. Stupid us forgot to bring cash so we decided to uber to the mall and watch a movie instead. Somehow walked to the furniture store at the end of the mall and sat on a couch in there. We sat and I'm not sure who started the conversation (probably me) but I confessed my feelings. Keep in mind that at this time she had been dating a guy for two months but she was starting to feel shaky about him.  She reciprocated my feelings and we kissed. It was everything my heart had dreamed of. I was so happy to hear that my biggest crush had felt the same way. Later that night we didn't watch much of the movie and things escalated. The next morning I felt bad and offered to forget everything. But she had decided she wanted to try this, although she was conflicted at first but said she doesn't regret it. A couple of days later (April fools day) her boyfriend came and she had said she wanted to end things but wasn't sure if she could. I was worried but I didn't need to be. They were having a grand old time at the lake then playing board games at the library until midnight. My heart was crushed. I cried that night and she came to comfort me. She always could comfort me like no other. She apologized, I, of course, forgave her but I was still hurt and never really got over this I guess. I guess I had nothing to worry about because he ended up not responding to her for a week. It wasn't until she asked if he were dead he responds 20 min later apologizing with BS. So she left him on read. From there were became a bit more official (i guess?) but we were still very very lowkey. It went on for a month. The first week or so was really sweet and cute but after that i could tell something changed. I was really in love with this girl, and I understand its way too good to be true but I really had hoped she would eventually feel the same way if she didn't already. she never did and ended up telling me she couldn't see me past friendship. I was hurt but I had to understand. We were friends first, right? Although when we were friends (a week before Shrek) she mentioned a couple of times what it would be like if we had met on tinder instead of as roommates. I had always wondered that, and may always wonder what could've been. Maybe a happy goat farm in Australia. But she doesn't feel the same way. She had told me this and two days later i had dropped her off at the airport. She had come back to my home to visit and see California. When i dropped her off, she asked for a kiss. we were both crying. It was really hard seeing her go. My best friend that meant everything whom I wouldn't see until the end of summer and by then things could be so different. And yes they are. The next day after she got home she texted me wanting to get back together. Telling me how much she needs me and me saying the same. I took her back but i was very very cautious. I kept feeling anxious that she would grow tired of me or meet someone else near school. I didn't think I was enough to have someone with such beauty and who is so amazing and full of light. Someone who makes my heart melt so easily like no other. Someone i would do absolutely anything for. Someone like no other. By the second week of trying things again she had decided she had enough and that we were better off as friends on may 28 2019. Completely wrecked me. I was nauseous for a week, waking up with so much anxiety i was running to the bathroom to puke. I had a bad anxiety attack a week later. we were supposed to be roommates with our other suitemate at these nice apartments so I wasn't sure how to go about getting over her and allowing myself to get used to seeing her as a friend. I couldn't see myself living there and having her SO over. So I decided to leave the roommate agreement and room with two other strangers at the apartments (wish me good luck). She didn't respond well to this news, which annoyed me. She felt as though i were bashing her when i felt like i was fighting to convince her to change her mind and take me back. (pathetic i know but i was convinced (kinda still am) that she was THE ONE). I apologized for my role, sincerely apologized, but then mentioned that I really wish she didn't decide to start a relationship with their best friend/roommate if they were 100% sure they had romantic feelings. She then got defensive and she didn't feel like she had a choice. That goddamn broke my heart to hear that she felt like she didn't have a choice in starting this relationship. I'm heartbroken over a relationship that was out of pity? Fear? IDK. I really tried to give her every opprotunity to forget it ever happened. I hate crying over her because she clearly never wanted me but damn i sure did want her.

I have 1 cat and her name is Tess, she is 5 years old.\n* I listen to a lot of music, I listen to most music except for mainstream music.\n* I play a lot of games but I prefer the ones with good stories.\n* I love cooking food even tho I do not get to do it often.\n* I sing quite a lot, but I do not think I'm very good at all.\n* I have 3 diagnoses. Trauma &amp; Stress, Autism, and 1 unspecified anxiety diagnose.\n\nIf you think we might be able to get along well, then post a comment or send me a message. Hopefully, we will be chatting soon! &lt;3", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I got 2 snaps from my friend (who I will refer to as Stella to keep her anonymous) I have a streak with Stella so it was nothing unusual. I opened her snaps and it had the time stamp of 4:45 and the caption said \u201cI\u2019m still locked out\u201d the next snap was a picture of her room, her bed was just a mattress the caption read \u201cmy mom packed up all my sheets and tore them up\u201d. I was concerned so I looked at her story and there was a snap taken at 1 am that said \u201c I\u2019m locked out\u201d. I texted her \u201c what\u2019s going on?\u201d. Stella replied quickly saying that she was out with friends and she had a curfew of midnight. Her and her friends rushed home but hit traffic so she missed her curfew. She then said that her mom Locked her out and put on the door chain so she couldn\u2019t use her key then proceeded to turn off all of the house lights. So she went to her friend\u2019s house and texted her mom that she was going to her friend\u2019s house because she didn\u2019t want to stay out on the street. She returned at 4 and she was still Locked out and then she had her cousin open the door for her. All of her bedding was ripped off and all of her stuff was taken out of her room. She told me that she didn\u2019t mean to miss her curfew and that she was scared to fall asleep because she knew that if she did, her dad would punch and beat her while she is sleeping. At school Stella would wear long sleeves and jackets often. She told me last night that she did this because she had bruises from her dad hitting her. I was so shocked and scared for her. I told her that it wasn\u2019t her fault that she\u2019s being hurt and she shouldn\u2019t feel guilty. I remember she told me a story once where she said the word \u201cstupid\u201d and her mom threw all of clothes on the lawn . Stella and I both graduated this year and during college decision season she got into a really prestigious state school. She got into 3 other state schools and had her heart set on one of the 3 other schools she got into. I also got into 1 of those schools and I was excited if she was gonna choose the same school as me. She said she wanted to but her mom said if she didn\u2019t choose the prestigious school that she was going to be disowned and she won\u2019t get any help for paying for college. Her parents are well off so she didn\u2019t receive any aide because she didn\u2019t qualify. She said she wants to call the police because she can\u2019t take the abuse but she if she does she would be kicked out of her house because she is 18 and she wouldn\u2019t be able to go to college because she would have no financial aide. I want to help her but idk what to do. I told her to hang in till August when she moves upstate for school. Is there anything else I can do to support my friend.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I felt that his communication skills arent very strong and he appears to find it hard to view things from other perspectives that his own. It doesn't matter most of the time, aside from that he is fun to spend time with. I dont mind compensating a bit for his lack of communication skill, and I always try to be very clear in my own communication to him to prevent miscommunication. I honestly believe he may have undiagnosed autism, as many of his other behaviour fits right in.  Fyi: I have more friends who are autistic so I do know some of the characteristics. \n\nLately it happens more frequently that we have communication issues. And he is crossing some boundaries as well, and that makes me feel unconfortable. Last week we had an argument which, reached a point where I believed nothing I would say or do would reach him, so I cut it off. I told him I did not feel confortable continueing the conversation as I did not believe it was going anywhere. I havent spoken with him since. \n\nAt the moment I feel a bit worn out. Trying to communicate with him has become an incredible energy drain, as it seems everything I say to him either does not reach him at all, or is twisted into something it isnt. When that happens he gets very upset, and it takes a lot of time and energy to get that right again. That makes it rather unpleasant to be around him. \n\nI intend to take a break from our friendship so I can get some rest until I feel up to talking to him about it again. However I am certain he will be upset when I tell this to him. And that is where I would like your advice. \n\nI want to explain to him I need a break from the friendship, and that it is not meant to hurt him, but because I need to take good care of myself in order to be able to be a good friend to him. \n\nAlso I would at some point want to discuss his behaviour and I want to set some clear boundaries. Even though I think he doesnt mean it bad, a friendship should not be draining my energy because he is unable to respect my boundaries. I dont mind putting in an extra chip because he lacks the skills but I dont want to feel unconfortable again. Question is, having in mind that this may be caused by autism, how to approach this?

However, next year we'll only be four (from a 10 person group) in the same class. This inculdes me, M, E and Q.\n\nM, E and I are very close, we all live on the same street and see each other outside of class on a daily basis.\n\nHowever, I can't seem to get close to Q. We share some common interests in arts and common viewpoints in politics and every real convo I ever had with him was truly fun and interesting (but those are very rare) \n\nHe's quite socially awkward, has a very short attention span most of the time and doesn't really talk to me apart from basic humain communication. On top of that, he's a guy (and I'm a girl) very wary of the opposite sex and of any physical contact with it. He lives quite fare away from downtown so he usually never comes to party or even friendly gatherings. He's very knowledgable of his flaws, he knows he never answers texts, he knows he's hard to get close to but it seems like he can't help it. \n\nBasically, we exchange jokes on each others character flaws (I'm quite snobbish/judgmental and that makes him laugh), a few remarks and that's it.\n\nMaybe it's useful to note that during the year, he started by being very close to E but distanced himself as soon as he realized that E had a massive crush on him (which made Q extremely uncomfortable) and after that, he only really got close to one of our male friends who's literally the most sto\u00efc guy on the planet (doesn't talk, plays on his phone) so it was really just Q talking and the guy nodding along.\n\nHe's really cool and I really want to get to know him more but I'm afraid to come across as annoying and clingy if I force myself onto him (not sure if this expression can be used when talking about a friendship ?). M and E are extroverts so it was rather easy to befriend them at first, but I'm quite introvert and so is Q.\n\nSo, any advice on how to befriend a guy like him ?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Met last year of highschool and were disconnected until becoming closer friends again in college and then now we are in grad school together.  We were literally roommates for 2 years of grad school as well. Anytime I go shopping or there's some opportunity be it scholarship, job, project, etc I would let her know. However I can never expect the same from this person. Feels like a competition at some points to be honest.The larger friend group we both commonly have in grad school I feel leaves me out and they have their own group chats without me, I voice my feelings about being left out to her. No input on her side usually \"I don't know... it just is that way\" or awkward silences. Am I expecting too much of a friend to at least give me the same commitment as I do to her? When it comes to other people she makes sure they're involved or makes sure to invite them when she's planning but if it's a collective group planned thing and my name doesn't get mentioned she doesn't go out of her way to try and invite me either. So maybe I'm just expecting too much of my friend or the effort I put in is just not being reciprocated, and should I just learn to distance myself and not expect anything.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019ll start by saying I\u2019ve been friends with this girl for about 7 years now.\n\nAfter my parents split up (3 yrs ago), I got really depressed (which has never really gone away) and a lot quieter, and I stopped talking to most of my friends. I decided to change schools, but I eventually started talking to this friend again, and now we\u2019re both going into the same high school.\n\nMy parents split left me with a lot of trust issues, for reasons I won\u2019t get into, but because of these, I have a lot of problems letting people befriend me. A lot of people I genuinely like, I randomly stop talking to. I\u2019m not happy with the way I am, and I\u2019m trying to fix that, but that\u2019s not the point of this post.\n\nThe point is. This friend. She\u2019s my polar opposite, very wild and extroverted, which, was ok, when we first started talking again. But now...not so much. Here\u2019s why:\n\n\n1. She will come to me for advice, and I\u2019ll give her advice. She\u2019ll come to me with homework she wants answers to, and I\u2019ll give her the answers. But she never does the same. When I ask for advice, she doesn\u2019t respond, or worse, just says \u201cidk\u201d. When I ask for help or answers on homework, she hasn\u2019t done the homework. When I need emotional support or someone to rant to, she doesn\u2019t say anything, or she changes the subject.\n\n2. She\u2019s too wild. She\u2019s so spontaneous and loud and WILD. And that\u2019s OK sometimes, but sometimes she needs to relax, and she CAN\u2019T. Now, part of it is ADHD, and that\u2019s ok, I understand that. But I\u2019ll give advice on ways to calm down (from websites and stuff), and she just turns it down without even trying it. I always worry about her because of this, and I try to mother or help her, but it never works.\n\n3. That\u2019s another thing. She doesn\u2019t accept help for anything other than homework (and even then, she just takes answers, not assistance). She\u2018ll rant, and I\u2019ll offer advice, and she makes up an excuse or points out a flaw in my statement, or ignores me all together.\n\n4. She mocks/insults me and my interests. I\u2019ll talk about something I like, and she\u2019ll say it\u2019s stupid and overrated. If I bring up some obscure show/band/game that I\u2019m into, she\u2019ll mockingly say that I\u2019m trying to be qUiRkY. She constantly wants to talk about her interests, and if I say anything that isn\u2019t \u201cOMG THAT\u2019S SO COOL I LOVE IT TOO\u201d, she gets annoyed and brings up a reason why I have to like it more or why it\u2019s better than what I like. \nEx. When the show The Umbrella Academy came out, I watched it and loved it, and she lent me the comics. I read them, and they were good, but I personally liked the show better, it had a more consistent story line and more likable/relatable representations of the characters. And she got annoyed, and said \u201cwell it\u2019s probably just because you watched the show first.\u201d\n\n5. She won\u2019t take any sort of criticism. She has a very \u201cI don\u2019t care what anyone thinks of me, and I am never wrong.\u201d sort of attitude. I understand that it\u2019s good to have confidence, but she takes it too far, to the point where she doesn\u2019t accept that sometimes she\u2019s wrong, and that she isn\u2019t perfect.\n\n6. She doesn\u2019t really think of other people. The other day, me, her, and another friend were hanging out, and me and the other friend were talking about how we don\u2019t talk back to our parents, and I mentioned how I never talk back because I don\u2019t want to hurt their feelings or upset them. And she says \u201cYou care about your parents feelings??? They\u2019re your parents, not your friends.\u201d and I was completely shocked. Like, that\u2019s something she\u2019d say, and I know that. But you should care about everyone\u2019s feelings, just because someone isn\u2019t your friend, or you don\u2019t like/know them, that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have feelings. Me and our other friend also once mentioned that we\u2018re really self conscious about certain things, and that we care about what other people think, and she told us \u201cJust stop caring. It doesn\u2019t matter, I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s not like you know these people. You won\u2019t ever see them again.\u201d and it\u2019s like, I get that SHE doesn\u2019t care, but I do, and I can\u2019t change that with the snap of my fingers.\n\n7. She\u2019ll ask me to watch a show/movie and I\u2019ll do it and tell her what I thought. But if I ask her to play a game, or watch something, she can\u2019t for whatever reason, and she\u2019ll just keep making excuses until I give up.\n\n\nAnyways. There\u2019s probably more, but these are the main things.\n\nI don\u2019t have a lot of other friends. I have some good friends I met at summer camp when I was like 8, and I talk to them through texts or dm\u2019s, but I don\u2019t really see them in person because I live sort of far, and they\u2019re older and go to different schools.\n\nI have one other friend that I\u2019ll be going to high school with, the one I mentioned in number 6, but she\u2019s a newer friend, and a one that we are both equally close to, and I\u2019m not sure how she\u2019d respond if I stopped talking to my friend. Back when my parents split, the friend and I stopped talking, and then our group of friends ignored me and kept hanging out with her, so I don\u2019t have good experience regarding \u201cmutual friend custody\u201d. \n\nI have a lot of trouble making and keeping friends, and I really don\u2019t want to have to make new friends if I don\u2019t absolutely have to. I\u2019ve known this girl for so long, and I\u2019d feel bad if I knew I wasn\u2019t doing everything I could to make things work.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the best approach is.

He is very competitive and mimicked me in almost every way possible which became quite toxic. There where several occasions where he informed others of events that happened in my life and claimed them as his own, after a year I addressed the situation. I am not pointing the finger souley at him, although it stemmed from this behaviour we both played our part in the downfall of our relationship. We no longer live together and things have improved, however, they are far from perfect. \n\nRecently my brother was let go from his company after a disagreement with his manager. Although he did not display a lot of emotion after the event I could tell he was hurt by what happened. On one occasion while visiting my house he told my roommate that he had left his job. He received a large severance as they did not have valid cause for his termination and he had mentioned several weeks previously that he was considering leaving to start his own business. \n\nShortly after while speaking to two of our other siblings who asked how our brother had been I mentioned what had happened between him and his employer. After doing so I immediately felt intensely guilty and depressed. I did not lie or slander him in anyway, and portrayed him as the victim of the situation, however, I know deep down that I did so to make him look bad. This is the first occasion that I have done something like this to anyone and I am finding it impossible to overcome the guilt. \n\nIt saddens me how we have personally been changed by our relationship. I know that what I have done is the outcome of my own insecurities which I have begun working on. \u00a0A large part of me wants to tell him that I mentioned what had happened to our siblings and apologise if he did not want anyone to know in order to admit my wrong doing on some level. I have also considered asking our siblings to keep the information to themselves or simply not mention it to anyone any further and wait for my emotions to subside. Lately, I have been dealing with some personal issues and I also believe that my anxieties are likely related more so to them rather to the situation at hand however this is the means in which it has surfaced. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated and thank you in advance.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

After 3 surgeries, 15 injections and a 4 years of PT it had come to the conclusion that the second surgeries caused and collapse and basically crushed several on the discs between the bone. It was basically a, you have to live with the pain and it will probably get worse before it gets better. I almost had a nervous break down at that point but to make matters worse, I had just had my first child, the light of my life, as hard as I tried and as much as I struggled, I could barley carry her, bend over to pick her up, run around and play with her....it all broke my heart. I felt like the worst father on planet earth. 6 months later I lose my job of 7 years due to the injury. Friends abandon me...2 years following even after trying to keep my wife happy, she, leaves me....I lose my home, my dogs, I lose the chance to wake up with my daughter every morning. The pain gets worse, constant migraines that last days at a time. Some days it\u2019s hard to walk, think straight, the depression builds, the anxiety is debilitating. Most days I feel dead inside, broken and completely lost. Between 2015 and today I have struggled to find jobs just to get by and keep getting let go because of missed days (maybe 3  or 4 times a month, I really fight to not miss days) or being slower than other employees. It\u2019s fucking embarrassing. I used to love working, I used to love waking up every morning at the crack of dawn just to start my day, and see my child, make breakfast and get my day started. I loved challenges, daily interactions, just being active and and learning new things and honing my craft every day. Now I\u2019m alone, broken, fighting and I have lost everything.\n\nThis year I lost both my grandparents(who raised me from the age of 1) and the day of my grandfathers funeral, my wife served me personal with divorce papers. My car was repossessed, I can hardly pay my bills and resorting to everything I can just to pay my child support, I fight to find a job (467 resumes and applications submitted) and nothing pans out. I\u2019m only 33 and find myself drowning every single day and feel like I have nothing left...\n\nI guess long story short. Cherish and fight for what you have, everything. the people around you, your body, your health, family. Everything. Because in the snap of your fingers, it could all be taken away.\n\nThis is basically the first time I\u2019ve opened up about any of this. Today hurts emotionally more than most days. I am tired...i feel as if I am losing my grip and feel as if I can not do this anymore.... I am scared\n\nTo whoever reads this, Thank you for your time.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

So about interests, I currently am working on a python program. It will be a diary. It will be fully encrypted too. Reading beginner tutorials is just too boring and I believe that the best way to learn is through practice. And of course as I like programming, I also like tech. And music. When I was 10 I got into Skrillex and that kind of music. Later on I got into more of NCS style music. And then I just listened to whatever is melodic and catches my interest. And now I\u2019m going through a very weird phase of 80s music. So I guess I listen to pretty mischievous everything. Except country. And heavy metal. I was very into books. In our library we have a scoreboard and I was up there every year. My favorites are Harry Potter series and the hunger game trilogy. It was amazing. \nOk, that will be it for now, otherwise I\u2019ll tell everything and we won\u2019t have anything to talk about.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We liked the same music, same taste in cars and we both found out we were going through hard times in our lives and that kept us going everyday for us. Once a day she'd always greet me in the morning and I'd return the favor. She had this, habit of saying \"I Love You\" but not in a sexual manner, I guess it's just her way of expressing affection or something. She was dating someone she knew for a long time and must have passed away recently because she started talking about her out of the blue one day and it didn't take me long to realize what she was saying and reached out to her and comfort her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was just, magical. Something I had never gotten a chance to experience before. And she had another friend named Shan who she knew since college that she would always talk to in addition to me and that was it. She was pretty lonely too and had no one else to talk to but me and her friend so we were pretty tight. At some point she made it clear to me she had feelings for this friend of hers and not too recently she told me she confessed to her everything and it worked out, so pretty cool. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this is also where Shan comes into play for recent events. I was told that she apparently had cheated on Lucy not too long ago (there was a period where I didn't talk to her for a while due to reasons) and that drove Lucy off the edge and apparently she...decided to kill herself. And here I am now, just pondering over the fact that she had so much going for her, so much we could have done together in life and lead a long fulfilling life and it's all over and snatched away in the blink of an eye. I don't know if I even believe this is real anymore, I keep thinking something isn't right and she's still out there. But I guess I'm wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut there's one thing she told me that stuck with me and forever will. One night she was drinking and I asked her, \"What would you do if I suddenly disappeared from you one day?\" and I remember her distinctly replying, \"I'll watch over you like an angel.\" Guess I asked for too much.

I like reading about dark and obscure shit. I'm also really into mysticism and the occult, in a non-ironic way that turns most people off.\n\nMedia wise... lots? BNHA, Haikyuu, Noragami, MP100 and Devilman Crybaby are my main anime shows. I just finished season 3 of Stranger Things. I'm getting back into Homestuck. I really like the Unwind book series, as well as Harry Potter. My favorite games are Maplestory, Animal Crossing, and Horizon: Zero Dawn. That's off the top of my head.\n\nI also have like, 30 pets. Including reptiles. Cats are my favorite though.\n\nWith my friendships... I like talking about anything and everything. I like being able to bring up random shit and go with it.

{"post_id": "cc9epg", "created_utc": 1562929299, "title": "Can never have too many friends 25/m", "author": "KifaSenpai", "self_text": "Just found this thread in my suggested feed and it\u2019s actually pretty awesome. It\u2019s really heart warming to see people be so honest about their needs and have so many people respond to them. Everyone out here saying they want to keep things short, nah let me rant for a sec and inflate my ego. I personally have a lot of good people I surround myself with, but as the title says you can never have too many friends, so feel free to add me. I\u2019m kind of a dweeb but I\u2019d love to get to know you. I\u2019ve struggled with depression, anxiety, abuse, bipolar, multiple breakups, unrequited love, self harm, and self loathing. If you\u2019d like to talk about any of these things, seek a distraction from them, or maybe learn some ways to cope, then I\u2019d love to help in any way possible. I\u2019ve ran a relatively \u201cbig\u201d tumblr account in the past dealing with these things and offering help/advice. I personally find it easier to help girls rather than guys simply because most guys have a slight bias when it comes to getting help and often I found that my way of explaining things seemed a bit too abstract to them, and so while I\u2019m definitely open to Anyone adding me and seeking help or companionship I\u2019m not perfect and I\u2019m not always going to be as patient with guys as compared to girls. I just want to be honest about that, part of what made me successful was knowing my limits, but don\u2019t let that discourage you. I am extremely passionate about music, any genre you can come up with I can probably give you at least 50 songs for. I am in love with all music except maybe country. Yes I mean everything. From jazz to screamo, edm to Beethoven, kpop to classic rock, rap to melodic death metal and everything in between, so I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find something to connect on. I\u2019m a sucker for old movies and fantasy books, we can chill and watch Disney or cheesy romcoms all day, literally I\u2019m up for anything. I\u2019m a NEET so anime and games and nerd culture is my bread and butter, I live on my own and that\u2019s legit all I do all day besides help people. I\u2019m top 100 in the entire world on 3 different heros in Dota2, and I\u2019ve seen about 300+ anime without counting things I\u2019ve rewatched multiple times. I love to watch things with other people, and I love finding out about new things, if you\u2019ve got a show you love that you think doesn\u2019t get enough attention let me know and I\u2019m probably down to binge it with you. As you can probably tell I have a slight ego (probably why I clash with guys more tbh) and I\u2019m pretty snarky and sarcastic sometimes, but if you\u2019re genuine and honest I\u2019ll more than likely be very gentle and kind to you, I know what it\u2019s like to feel like there\u2019s no one willing to stand beside you as you struggle through life, and it sucks, that\u2019s why I kind of vowed to myself that I\u2019d help people at every opportunity I got. Now hopefully this post will get some traction and a lot of you will reach out so let me just throw out some ground rules. I have basically infinite free time, so if I don\u2019t respond right away it\u2019s because I\u2019m helping someone or spending some alone time when things get overwhelming in life. Time zones are a thing and I always have notifications on so please be respectful and don\u2019t spam at night unless necessary. (GMT -7) I\u2019m 25, and while I understand there are a lot of people who go through things and want help or friends, I prefer that you would please at least be 19 regardless of gender, I only mention it because I noticed there are a lot of younger people on this thread. It\u2019s hard to be relatable or helpful when the age difference is too big, also it\u2019s very easy for others to get too emotionally invested in the person helping and so I hope you\u2019ll respect that, I feel like it\u2019s just common sense tbh.

I just enjoy it for what it is and don't live in it or study it :-) and I guess I see the world a bit more magical than most people...\n\nI am often described when people chat to me as chatting to a 12 year old, I don't know if this is accurate but maybe it will help? I Don't swear. Talk about anything sexual, watch r rated movies... drink alcohol, smoke and have never touched any illegal substances. I know this makes me boring to most people but I hope someone out there might like to talk with me.\n\nI really want a friend who has time to voice chat sometimes, but has to be someone appropriate. Most of all, someone who has time. Please know, **I am not after help or \"someone to listen\"** I really just want a friend to talk to sometimes. Maybe about games or toys or lego or pokemon, and someone who will message me. As sometimes messaging others is hard for me. (Starting conversations) - I find most people struggle with starting conversations.\n\nIf you are the kind of person who hates to message first, I might not be the best kind of friend.\n\nI would prefer skype for voice or some other program if you know one? I also have Email that I check every day and reddit messages. I do not use my cell phone much at all.\n\nThank you and apologies to anyone who feels they wasted time reading this.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We have had a long history (the leaders) and have come away with several relationships that have lasted a long time. Most of us just chat when we have time and want to talk, and we talk about various things. Some subjects that come to mind: banter, our daily lives, politics, and real world stuff in general. We are all very diverse of interest, and all of us are active (we remove inactive people, who don't invest time.) I would say we have a good split of US and EU people, as well as a nice spot of Australians/SEA , and also Men/Woman ratio.\n\nWhat we're looking for is genuine people, who want to make long lasting friendships. The type of person who comes in to the chat and interacts with us, not just posts a meme and leave. If you're shy, socially awkward, we get it. We will allow you time to open up, and none of us are very judge-y. If you're coming in to this community, get ready to explore a world of genuine people with real thoughts and feelings, this is not a meme fest, although it can be. We have several channels and topics of discussions going on, and we're quite active as a rule - politics, not safe, selfies, introductions etc. Introducing yourself and showing yourself are highly encouraged, though not mandatory.\n\nIdeally you will be:\n\n\\- Honest (I do not want meme personalities or personas here. If you have crippling depression we get it, but be yourself.)\n\n\\- Interactive\n\n\\- Willing to voice chat sometimes or be very text-active\n\n\\- Authentic\n\n\\- Be looking for real friends from real people\n\nPS: If you only play games, it's likely not a great fit - this is a \\*social community\\* where you talk and make friends. This being said - we will have a dedicated minecraft server in the future, though this is not a focus. We also play Jackbox, CAH and Stardew Valley.  \n\n\nPlease DM me with a blurb about you so I don't have to search your entire Reddit history to discover anything about you, thanks!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I think everyone on here knows, it's really hard to make a genuine connection with someone. Maybe you just don't click.

People who come to just troll/ be assholes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think a fair amount of people in this sub don't have anybody. They are going through some shit, and are lost in the world. This sub is supposed to be a way for us to genuinely care about each other and offer **friendship.** But instead, shitty people come in here and use and abuse you. Do you not realize that that is a **person** you are talking to? Maybe these people are taking advantage of the vulnerability of others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was talking to someone this week as a result of my post. It was actually going really well. I was really enjoying our communication and had plans to be real friends for a long period of time. We were texting daily. This was such a rare occurrence for me - I literally have NO friends to talk to. No family, nobody IRL or even online. So I thought I had finally met a genuine person - as most of my interactions have not been so.\n\ntoday they finally hit me with the truth - they were keeping me a secret from their wife, who was on vacation. Although we were not discussing anything sexual, and were not doing anything wrong (my bf knew full well of our discussions) he informed me that he could not talk to another woman. He knew this from the start. He used me, lying about his intentions, and kept me a secret, all temporarily while he could get away with it. I am angry and hurt that I have to drop this guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot only that, it only confirms my assessment that there are no real genuine people on this earth that will talk to me and that will get along with me. That will actually care about me beyond using me for their own selfish needs. I give up, and am now leaving this sub, and possibly reddit for the time being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to say my piece, alert people here to be wary about who they choose to confide in, and overall send a message to those who think it's okay to come into subs like these and hurt others who are desperately searching for support.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I probably have to admit that I'm usually a slightly below average social guy, but I'm working on it. On the other hand, it is me who wants a working friendship environment, which probably means I might be more social than my friends. (?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike so many other people, I struggle with many friendships (let's say 90% of them), where I'm feeling like I'm the more invested part of it. They really never reach out first and it is always me who has to do the first step. This makes me somehow feel like I'm not really valueable to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know, if it is the right thing to do to interpret so much into this, but that's subconsciously my mindset atm. I try to make it easy for them to reach out and want to be in their mind sometimes. Today for example; I published a WhatsApp Status, which shows a picture of me photographing and captioned with \"Finally, summertime is funtime\". It was marked as seen by friends, where our last conversation is months in the past, yet they leave it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is one girl for example. She has seen my status photo and we didn't chatted for more than 2 month now. Many things happened during that time. I used to date her for a very short time half a year ago, but she kind of mildly rejected me. No problem - I accepted it of course, moved on datingwise and asked her if she wants to stay friends - she gladly accepted. I was happy to not entirely loose this interesting person I had interests in common with, but now, where she stays silent like all my other friends, I'm not sure if it wasn't just a set phrase to be polite. She is just an example, but she is the most recent 'case' and this keeps me rethinking of all of my other friendships as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't get me wrong. Nobody ignores or even ghosts me if I reach out, but it this task of making initial contact what bugs me. In further consequence, I'm thinking if they don't reach out or want to do something together, it really doesn't matter to them if I'm alive or dead...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo is there anything I can do to change it or at least don't care about always being the active part and if so, how should I accomplish this? Do I overthink the whole concept of friendship? Right at the moment it feels like nobody really likes me and that makes me kinda sad :(", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She went into engineering and I into medicine. We were very close and had a good amount of contact (once or twice a week with our hectic schedules) until around my third year of university, where I felt as though she became slightly more distant and hung around less, as she got embroiled in her studies and said she was having a tough time. It gradually got worse from there, bailing out of get togethers and looking at WhatsApp messages and not answering. And for the record no I didn\u2019t bombard or stalk her or anything. But even if I contacted her once every couple of weeks (a WhatsApp message, private Snapchat post, memes on a group etc) the reply would either be begrudged or none at all. I begun to feel infuriated as I found it disrespectful and that only I was keeping up one end of the relationship. As the summer after my third year came I just stopped contacting her entirely.\n\nAs my fourth year rolled round and my other mate (who is also a childhood friend) contacted us to get together, she made excuses and we noticed that she wasnt riding the bus and others in our circle had asked about her whereabouts. She soon revealed to us that, in summary, she\u2019d failed her way out of university and wouldn\u2019t be able to re-enroll, she\u2019d have to find another institution to study at, and start from scratch, which is what she ended up doing. She\u2019d always dreamt of being an engineer and persisted on that dream despite the setbacks and poor grades she\u2019d gotten. I\u2019d just like to clarify to anyone wondering about my take on that - if I were to be brutally honest I\u2019d say I never put her down as one who could cut the mustard in that type of field, but she\u2019s someone sensitive to criticism and has an immature side to her which means you have to choose your words carefully. I kept those thoughts to myself of course, but I did gently suggest back in high school that perhaps she could pick something better suited to her talents, but she didn\u2019t listen and is her own autonomous figure, in the end. \n\nAnyway, I was devastated, she was depressed and revealed to me that she was contemplating suicide, and I believe I entered a period of almost clinical depression myself over the situation, wondering what would happen, the years that were lost, how she\u2019d start over, etc. I told her I\u2019d always be there for her and that I\u2019d try my best to help her anyway I can.\n\nThat was about 18 months ago. Since that time, she has continued on with that same communication style on social media, but developed a new addition of putting passive aggressive comments on Snapchat, Twitter, WhatsApp updates... just teenage ranting tumblr post style stuff or a black background with messages about people being dicks, people\u2019s true colors, if you don\u2019t like me then xyz, trusting no one in this world etc. I gave up a long while ago as medical school got hectic and the last time I saw her face to face was approximately a year ago (last summer).\n\nNote that we haven\u2019t fought in a long while (since before she even left my uni) and are on good terms.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to contact her to meet up this summer but she always moans about how much work she has and that her schedule is full. If I ask how she is she never gives any details at all, just a \u2018fine\u2019. The uni she goes at only opened a few years ago and may not have any graduates yet, and her workload is considerably (even objectively) lighter than mine, and even I can find time to socialize.\n\nI know, I know. It\u2019s a two way street and she\u2019s not reciprocating. If she truly cares she\u2019ll put in the effort. Her social media rants are just to get attention. People change and move on. She\u2019s making it clear she\u2019s not interested. Being geographically removed complicates things. Sometimes people just grow apart. I\u2019m aware of all these logicalities.\n\nShe may be immature, but she has a lot of great qualities: she\u2019s kind, loyal, works hard, is funny, bubbly and full of life, and is passionate about the things she does. She always had my back and helped me in a lot of dark moments. All the memories we created. I can\u2019t imagine just letting all of that fizzle out because of a few rocky years, which, if the relationship still persisted for many years to come, is just a drop in the bucket. We made a commitment.\n\nPlus, I can\u2019t help but feel as though I need to support her through her struggles with her education and career. She was depressed for a long time and has had to start from scratch. I don\u2019t want to be a crap friend for just walking out on her when she may have needed me most, but she\u2019s pushing me away.\n\nShe\u2019s not helping me to help her, so to speak. If she doesn\u2019t let me in, what can I do? Like I mentioned previously, at least to my knowledge I haven\u2019t done anything to breach her trust or anything, and we\u2019re on good terms...\n\nSo any comments or insight for me?

I really like talking to them, but I am afraid of losing them because of the distance. This involves internet friends, as well as friends I'll have to leave because of  college. \n\nHaving long distance friends is new to me, so maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I find after a while we run out of things to talk about. The initial talks are always great cause we are still learning about each other, but after a while it slows down. Eventually it resorts to \"what's up\" followed by \"nothing\" responses that don't lead to more talking. It's different from short distance conversations where we can arrange to meet up and hang out and have the relationships grow naturally that way. \n\nAny advice for keeping a long distance relationship fun and engaging and not drift away?", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Then she would bring her boyfriend up trying to relate him into the meme. \n\nFor example, she sent me a weird photo of one of the office characters on leggings, so I said we should buy it then she responded with \"Do you think this would turn on (boyfriend's name)?\" Another time was when we were talking about classic Disney movies and she brought up how she found Zac Efron hot and that she would leave for boyfriend for him.\n\nIt has gotten to a point where I would only hear her boyfriend's name and I can't even go through a conversation without her bringing him up in some shape or form. I get it, she loves her boyfriend, but having a boyfriend is not a personality trait and it is really annoying when I just want to talk about anything, but him.\n\nOne time he texted me over social media and subtly flirted with me (I'll provide screenshots to anyone who asks.) when they were supposed to break up. I told her about this and it seems like she was mad at me, even though I proved to her I shut him down in a heartbeat because I don't find him attractive and I'm not a bad friend.\n\nWhat should I do?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I am a really nice person, but the world decided that lt hates me. I've tried friendship sites, but they're all fake or didn't work out. I'm not even being dramatic. I seriously have nobody.

I'm really tired of being ghosted by everyone I meet for absolutely no reason. It happens over &amp; over again. I meet someone who seems great &amp; I think I've finally found someone different who will stick around &amp; actually care. And then they disappear or die or we lose contact.\n\nI don't consider myself hard to please. I don't need expensive gifts, I'm pretty forgiving &amp; I'm generally low-maintenance.

He doesn't talk as much in calls, and has made some off-hand comments talking about how \"his mistakes keep him up at night\". I've tried coaxing the conversation, but he'd only give me vague answers before dismissing the topic with something along the lines of \"it's in the past\". I don't want to force him into talking, because I know from experience that that'll only make him shut down. \n\nI'm just worried about him because he's like a brother to me and I don't know how to help.

For anonymity, let's call them Alex. We met in school, and that's where we normally interacted in real life. We had never actually been to eachothers homes though. I moved away from Alabama a bit more than a year later. We have kept in touch through the internet, and we do phone calls and video chat together, and we even play games together through the internet. I won't reveal our exact ages for privacy, but we are both young and still live with our parents. I am taking a vacation to Alabama to visit family, and Alex lives very close to where we are going. I'm considering visiting them if they can also do so.\n\nBut now back to the point. As I've phone called Alrx and video chatted with them, I've heard their mother talk in the background before (I know it's their mother because I asked them who was talking in the background). But I have never heard their father, and I have reason to believe Alex doesn't know their father that well (or maybe at all). \nThey have made jokes on fathers day like \"Is it father's day today? Oh, well time to go to prison!\" Or, at least, they try imply they're jokes because of how they say it. They also mention their mom many times, but never their father. And they've made what seem like jokes, like they said they'd show me a picture of their dad, then show a mugshot. I don't know if they are real photos though. I never asked if the jokes are actually jokes, and if the photo was real, because I didn't want to be rude.\n\nBut before I visit Alex (If I even can), I just want to ask them if they know their father. Because if they don't, I thought it might be awkward to find out in person rather than finding out by asking them over the internet.\n\nHow can I ask them in a respectful manner and not be rude? I don't want to trigger any emotions about their father or anything. Does anyone here not know one of their parents, and maybe know how I should ask?

I\u2019ve struggled with depression and social anxiety most of my life. I grew up in a very strict Christian home that was more like a cult, it slowly got stricter and stricter as me and my sibling grew older. It got to the point we\u2019re we were locked away from everyone and everything and had to stay at home and socialise with no one. Around this time I think I was like 13, I was still in primary school. My parents convinced my gullible mind into doing homeschool from the computer. I thought it would be great cause I was nervous to go to high school but I was stupid because school was the only way I was still socialising. I started high school from home and from there my life was fucked, I went year after year locked at home. The only people I had was my older brother and sister who ended up moving out so I was completely alone. I attempted suicide multiple times, at age 16 I moved out with my sister who I am still currently living with. When I first moved out it was like being released from prison I thought my life was finally going to change. My depression was completely gone but I wasn\u2019t aware of the severe social anxiety I was left with. I continued homeschool because I was to nervous to go back to a normal school again, It had been so long. \n\nThis is were I started to notice my insecurities and social anxiety, I was too insecure to go to high school at 16 because I have always looked way younger than my actual age. My anxiety has gotten so bad from when I moved out at 16 to now at 18. I still don\u2019t look my age and it makes me really insecure, I\u2019ve never dated a girl my entire life and now that I\u2019m 18 I just feel so fucking alone and in position where I am too insecure to even ask a girl out because let\u2019s be real no 18 year old girl wants to date someone else that\u2019s 18 but looks like a teenager thats shy and awkward. I\u2019m so fucking depressed and alone I need someone in my life, I cry myself to sleep almost every night knowing I will forever be alone. I\u2019m finding it really hard to find any reason to live right now, it\u2019s been a while since my last suicide attempt but lately I\u2019ve been really down, the day before my 18th I was getting suicidal thoughts again this is my last resort. \n\nP.S. I\u2019m live in South Australia.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I didn\u2019t tell Ashley for 2 weeks and during those two weeks she asked many questions that basically hinted that she knew I was seeing my ex again, however I was so scared to tell her that I was because I didn\u2019t want anyone to know , at least until I knew what me and him were and was confident about it. My lies ended up spiraling because I was trying to save my ass and she said she ended up believing my lies and feeling stupid. I came clean and she said she feels beyond lied to and has no more trust for me. We work together on sundays and mondays too and now I\u2019m beyond sick to the thought of working. She moves to UCSB in September but her last day at work is the 28th of this month.

We played games, and I've noticed 2 of my friends always swearing or making racial jokes at me. I found it funny at the start, I have some humor sense.\n\nAfter some time, it was even worse and worse, and it started to make me mad. I was starting to feel unwanted, so I asked them about this and they didn't really respond so clearly, I didn't know what to do, so I just ignored it. One day, we've played a game, and one of them started to blame me and \"taught me to play the game\", although I know how to play, and he knew I didn't like it. Then, my close friend started to agree with the other guy and that really got me on my nerves, its only a game, and they were very mad at me. I didn't try to be bad at the game, they knew how I was playing but they kept on laughing at me. I've finished, the game, and left the call.

I end up meeting this guy (let\u2019s call him K) who I end up really liking later on down the road, and at first, J is really wary because I\u2019m spending a whole lot of time with K and he became jealous. But J eventually was alright with him. I tried to divide my time between J and K, so that I could spend time with both of them.\n\nWhen I end up having a crush on K, I guess I did not tell J that I did ended up liking K (when I previously didn\u2019t). So when K and I start dating, J flips. \n\n   I got text messages from J the morning after I start dating K, accusing me of lying and leading him on (when I specifically told J that I did not have feelings for him like that). He was super hurt and said that he did everything for me, that how could I choose K over him. All in all, it made me feel really bad and really suffocated and like utter shit. I did not know what to do. I consulted my friends and K and I called J out on his behavior, telling him it was not okay to treat me like that, that I did not lead him on. We talked it out and I end up giving him a second chance as friends, and we continue our friendship.\n\nTwo weeks go by, and everything is fine, until J starts up again. He saw me kissing K, and he confronted me, saying it hurt the fuck out of him to see that. He basically starts guilt tripping me again, like the first time and it starts to make me feel like shit all over again. So I end up calling him out on it again, and we meet up to talk, and that was where I basically told him that we were toxic for each other, that I was hurting him and I did not want to do that, and he was hurting me, so I broke off our friendship, although I did say that we could try again, later on down the road. The fact that I did not choose him was literally affecting him in other aspects of his life. I hated having to break off our friendship but he was guilt tripping me and making me feel like trash for making a decision that made me happy. In general, J was always super needy and clingy and hung up over past events that hurt him. I helped him out as much as I could with his issues and I tried to be good friend to him. And he was a good friend and a good kid, and he did make me feel suffocated and like shit sometimes whenever I did not spend time with him, but I was always super forgiving. I know that I hurt him by not choosing him and I\u2019m just wondering:\n\nWas my decision to end it too harsh? Was I wrong for cutting him out of my life?

We had been close to best friends for the past 2 or 3 years and have been good friends since middle school. About a year a ago I had begun to notice some toxic behavior- she would kinda manipulate people in our friend group into doing things for her. Stuff like paying for her food or just making people do things they didn\u2019t really want to do, but it wasn\u2019t anything extreme so I thought of it as more of an annoyance more than anything. She also has never really been attentive to my life. She has always been the type of person where I would tell her something about my day or something like that and she would respond with \u201cdamn\u201d or \u201comg.\u201d She also would just be a dick sometimes. We had gone to a party together and I didn\u2019t really know any of the people there so I started feeling extremely anxious- I was on the verge of tears because I felt so uncomfortable. Of course I turned to her and I explained what was happening and asked for my car keys so I could go sit in my car and just get away from everything and she just looked at me like I was insane and said, \u201cyour kind of scaring me right now.\u201d Lol of course that made me feel so much better. \n\nI would have cut her off long ago, but we were in the same friend group and I wanted to avoid conflict and didn\u2019t want to make people choose sides. So I sucked it up and have been putting up with her for the past few months. Don\u2019t get me wrong though she did have her good friends moments where she was encouraging and supportive and kind. That was the only reason I was able to put up with her for so long. \n\nIn the past week or so she hooked up with one of the people in our friend group. Long story short after it happened everyone found out and realized that she had tried to get with him many times in the past, but she only would do so when he was drunk or crossed. So everyone realized how fucked up that was and began to rethink their friendship with her. They were also fed up with her being a shitty friend as well they decided to cut her off. \n\nNow after all of this shit I just explained for some reason I still feel bad for cutting her off??? I guess it\u2019s because I was basically her best friend and everyone in that friend group were her only real friends. So cutting her off means that she will literally have no friends. \n\nI also called her to explain why I no longer wanted to be friends she was s o b b i n g. She also made some good points that I never actually communicated to her that anything was wrong; I just one day hit her with a text message explaining why I wanted her out of my life. If anyone deserves to be cut off it\u2019s her but I can\u2019t help but to reminisce over the actual good times we had together.\n\nBasically I\u2019m just looking for reassurance that I did the right thing by cutting her out of my life even though I can\u2019t help but feel terrible about it. Also if anyone else has had to do this sort of thing did they feel the same way?? Even if you know they\u2019re toxic?\n\n(Also sorry that was so long lmao I just needed to  get that out of my system)", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Now sarah and i got in a fight over the fact i accidentally ate her ramen she had brought from her trip with jake. but get this sarah and i literally share everything however sarah doesn\u2019t go grocery shopping because jake lets her eat his food and he basically covers all her cost in life. now i\u2019m the only one going to school full time, interning and working all at once so i\u2019m often not home. i also cant afford to cover her cost and my cost whenever we do things so our hang outs are basically whenever the both of us get off work late and smoke a blunt. but even then i have to take the initiative to plan any hangouts. it even got to the point where i wanted to hang out with her so bad i said let\u2019s go get tattoos because i knew she wasn\u2019t going to say no. now i have a dumb tattoo on my thigh that i hate.\n\n i don\u2019t really mind when things go missing but sarah won\u2019t let me live down that i ate her ramen even took it to twitter and tweeted various times about what had happened, causing a pretty intense fight between all of us. now i left for about a week to go to dallas with my parents and process what had happened. today sarah text me saying to salvage our friendship she must move out with jake and i must take care of myself before she can help me. but mind you sarah rarely ask me what\u2019s up with my life or how i\u2019m doing. i\u2019ve grown kinda resentful of her but i understand her moving out because i was going to do that but only i was waiting to talk to them in person. she hid behind a screen again. i know this post doesn\u2019t seem very coherent but my feelings are hurt. i feel like i gave my all to a friend that never gave me back the same energy now i know the only thing i can do for here is move forward but i can\u2019t help but feel like my heart broken. i don\u2019t think sarah and i will ever be friends again because i can\u2019t handle a 30/60 friendship. \n\np.s. i\u2019m so sorry this post is all over the place, i\u2019m not sure if i\u2019m posting in the right spot but i just need to let it out of my chest", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We moved about a month ago, and we\u2019ve texted pretty much all day every day since then, with a few exceptions. Yesterday, however, it felt different when we talked. It didn't feel like she was making an effort to keep the conversation going at all and she kept changing the subject quickly, even when I said I wanted to talk about it more. Last night, I was talking about a project I had been working on for a while (since before we moved) and she called it a \u201dlost cause\u201d. I'm sure that she didn't intend to be mean, but it really felt that way and I wasn't sure how to respond. I waited a couple minutes trying to think of something to say, but I couldn't. I expected that she would realize that what she said offended me, but after a couple more minutes of neither of us saying anything, she sent another message where she just completely changed the subject. It really felt like something was wrong, so I asked her, and I could tell that she felt really awkward and anxious about it. She asked if I wanted the truth and I said yes, and she told me that she thought that I liked her (as in I wanted to date her). I asked her why she thought that and she said that it was because I called her beautiful and cute a lot and that didn't seem like something people who were just friends would say to each other. I thought that I was just complimenting her when I said those things and that she was okay with it, but now that she\u2019s pointed it out, I do understand why she would think that. I told her that. I told her that I didn't like her in that way. I told her that our friendship was one of the most important relationships in my life to me and I would never want to do anything that would make it awkward. I told her that I would call her beautiful and cute less (I offered to stop saying it completely, but she said she didn't want that). Almost immediately after that, she stopped texting so she could do something with her sister, and she didn't text me again until very early in the morning when I was already asleep. When I woke up, I apologized for how weird last night was and for saying those things about her, and I tried to talk to her about other stuff, but it still felt like she wasn't interested in the conversation at all, just like yesterday. Then she told me that she was gonna do stuff with her sister today so she wouldn't be able to text at all for a majority of the day. She stopped talking around lunch and it's 11 pm now and she still hasn't even read the message where I said goodbye to her.\nIt's completely possible that I'm just overreacting or being paranoid or something, but it really feels like hanging out with her sister was just an excuse to not talk to me. She's never just decided to spend a whole day with her sister and not talk to me before, or at least she's never done it in the time that I've known her (about a year). It really feels like she just doesn't want to talk to me because she doesn't believe that I don't like her. And I don't know how to talk to her about it without sounding like an asshole because it's good that she's doing stuff with her sister, it just really feels like part of her is only doing it so that she doesn't have to talk to me. And even if that is what's happening and I talked to her about it and she admitted it, I still wouldn't know how to convince her that I don't like her. Am I just overreacting? Or is she avoiding me? How do I convince her that I don't wanna date her when all I can do is text her (I tried to call her today so that we could talk about it, but she said she couldn't because she was doing stuff with her sister. It was the first time she had ever not wanted to call me when I asked)? How do I save our friendship from falling apart in awkwardness?

Today I went to play Basketball alone, there was a group of teenagers who let me join them. They look like very close friend and they seems to be very close. Then I realize I haven't had any friend like that for a very long time. \nI think the reason that I don't have a friend could be I'm played too much video games and thought I could live without a friend. But recently, I lost interest in most video games and I felt I want a friend so much and I feel terrible if I don't have one.\nAnd I find it so hard to find a friend. I don't know how to start a proper conversation. Whenever I met my nice neighbors, I don't know what to say other than saying Hi.

Future friend, I will mukbang with you all day (not a sexual thing, unless you have some weird fetishes (?)).\n\n**Why do you deserve the role of friend?**\n\nI have intensely fast typing skillz, aka when you need comfort, I can whip out 29 messages in 30 seconds about how awesome you are. I'm also a decent listener, and I feel like I'm a pretty empathetic person, if you ever want to share. I also send good morning texts! \n\n**What qualities do you have that other friends don't have?**\n\n\\*checks list\\* well, not much really.... \\*cough\\*\n\n**What are your interests?**\n\nI study computer science at university, and I work as a teaching assistant for intro programming. I also do research in small angle neutron scattering reduction and machine learning (that's enough tech jargon, I promise, no more fancy words). In my free time, I like to rock climb, slackline (aka slack off), play pokemon, play piano, draw and then rip up said drawings in anguish, develop questionable iOS apps, and pretty much anything except for cardio. I'm also a borderline insomniac that's been forced to do all these things to kill the crippling boredom.\n\n**How do you like to be contacted?**\n\nPreferably through head scratch.... ok bad joke, but I really do like head scratches. I use WhatsApp, but if you're really cool and not a creep, I could be convinced to use SnapChat or \\*gasp\\* text.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notify me within three to five business days with your job offer for role of \"FRIEND\" if I passed this interview!

(ill also mention that he was banned from the 3rd floor of our school for vandalizing and he was very depressed and had adhd and his dad was abusive.) one of the nights i had slept over i had walked in on him slitting his ankles with razor blades, though we had made a promise along the lines of whatever he did i did/whatever i did he did. so i had hugged him and i walked in later and he did it again so i took a razor blade and locked myself in the bathroom and slit my ankle. after that i got him to throw away all the razor blades (or so i thought) in their neighbors yard. and then that night his dad got drunk while we were all sitting on the couch and he started yelling and hitting at him. i had never experienced anything like it. but anyways that night i was sleeping in his sisters room and he paired his phone to the tv and played sad Simpsons edits (lol).. anyways the next night i convinced my parents to let me sleepover again but this time i had been laying in his room and we started messing around and he told me he wanted to have sex, long story short i said no four times and he did it anyways.. i didn't think of it as rape and i had the mindset of \"oh i lost my virginity so it doesn't matter what i do now\" so we kept doing it and it was bad and it was gross and sometimes public. just all around bad. eventually the police got involved because of a chain of nudes going around our school and our names were brought up and then he went to outpatient and i lost my shit. i end up being grounded and confessed to the sex but not rape. eventually after being grounded i started smoking pot and was raped by 2 different drug dealers (both over 18) and started smoking 4-7 times a day everyday. id pay 40$ extra for them to come same night if i didn't have it and i didn't exactly have the most money. now i've been sent to outpatient twice and ive been in therapy for three years. also anonymous letters were sent to my parents, the elementary school where my siblings go, and the middle school i went to, along with chief of police claiming that i had been doing a lot of things that i haven't done (or exaggerated versions of things i had done in the past) the p.t.a moms saw it and the rumors that spread around my town from 7-8th grade made me lose all my friends. all of them, and if i do have friends their parents wont let me go to their house. i'm on medication now and its really hard being alone and i was hoping to find a friend or two.. sorry for the long post.

I'm more of a lurker but have been advised to reach out on the site and see if I'm able to *fill a void* of loneliness.\n\nI'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor's in Paralegal Studies in Toronto, Ontario. I also work full time as a legal assistant.\n\nOver a year ago I was diagnosed with high functioning depression, and anxiety. Only as of recent have I found an amazing psychotherapist, who's helped me figure out me in the best way possible. One of the biggest breakthroughs we've had is figuring out the lack of support in my life. I have a wonderful boyfriend of 9 years who I confide in and a mother who's doing her best to understand what I'm going through. This is a little hard for her as a South East Asian since mental health issues are a little more *taboo* to them.\n\nWhat I don't have is a solid support of friends. I have very few friends but they are people that I've known for a good portion of myself. As days go by, I became a lot more introverted, especially when I realized that I've gone through different traumatic experiences which my friends are unable to relate to. I know they are trying their best but sometimes I really feel like I'm desperately calling out for help to them and the only thing they can gather is a *oh that's crazy, I'm so sorry that you're going through that*. Don't get me wrong, I love these friends of mine and they are genuinely good people but I wish I had more people in my life that can relate to what I'm going through.\n\nA lot of my depression stems back from my emotionally abusive father abandoning me and my family when I was 14 (he left us, got married and took care of his step children over me and my mother). Now that I'm 24, after going through a bashful, gossiping community, poverty, suicide attempts, isolation and just feeling absolutely lost, he's realized he made a mistake and is here right now because he is *sorry*.\n\nI feel like a pandora's box of emotions have opened and I was so close to closing the relationship with my father, but now he's back, and my mother and brother \\[32\\] are both ecstatic and not understanding of the hardship I'm going through. I feel like the black sheep in the family. I feel like I have to compromise all my feelings all over again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I also play games like PUBG, Left 4 dead 2, Garry's mod, Stick fight, etc although I am kinda burned out from gaming except random skyrim/pubg sessions.\n\n\u2022 I mostly watch action/thriller/horror/Marvel/DC movies. Mainly interested in movies made by Tarantino, David Fincher, Nolan, Guy Ritchie, etc. also likes are Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, Vikings and Stranger things ( Just finished 3rd season and it was amazing! )\n\n\u2022 My other hobbies include reading, travelling and listening to music ( pop,metal,country ) but not really feeling to do any of those thesedays... I also love nature, history and science.\n\n\u2022 I don't have any preferences so your age/ location/ gender/ timezone doesn't matter for me.

I am not good at giving advice but I can listen without any judgement or whatsoever. We don't have to talk daily for hours or something, but it would be nice to keep in touch once in a while if one of us goes inactive/ busy in real life.\n\nThat's all I can think of atm..

I'm on my phone so I may not make sense. This is long too\n\n TL:DR is at the bottom. \n\nI've been best friends with her since the 3rd grade. I'll call her J. We go WAY back and have so many memories. She makes me laugh and she's very good person. I do love her and she's my sister. \n\nShe has a cousin who is 20. I'll name him C. He's the epitome of \"fucked up.\" He's already an alcoholic and loves to smoke weed and abuse it. He also barely had a baby girl and he hardly ever sees her. He literally doesn't have his priorities straight. \n\nI met him when he came over to my place with J. I could already tell from the get-go he was fucked up. He drank 2 shots of fireball and then one shot of Grey Goose. He heard that my boyfriend smokes weed and tried and begged him for some but my boyfriend kept telling him he's out. (he lied cuz he knew he was fucked up). Not long after, he passed out on my couch. I thought I had to call 911 cuz he was SO out of it and he was freaking me out. J said \"he's fine. Let him be.\" After a while, J and I woke him up. (my boyfriend already went to bed so it was just me and her) We had to help him walk down the stairs from my apartment to her car. When we got to her car, he along the lines said, \"I respect you and especially your boyfriend but since he's not here, can I see your boobs?\" That really bugged me and I flat out said NO. Then he asked if he can just feel. I again said NO. From then on, I wanted nothing to do with him. I told my boyfriend this and that really pissed him off. C is not allowed at our place again. \n\nA while back before the breast thing, he requested to be my friend on FB. I accepted cuz I knew who he was. Later, J told me he did that cuz he thought I was hot. I thought that was fucking weird and creepy cuz he had a girlfriend. I eventually deleted him. He tried to friend me again but I denied. I'm sticking to it cuz I just don't like the kid. \n\nShe's hanging out with him all the time. She complains he's really annoying. She has to hide her liquor whenever he comes over. He doesn't drive. He doesn't have a car. He is always bugging her to pick him up. She will say no a few times but after a while, she relents. He's selfish in that way and doesn't care about anyone but himself but yet she's always relenting to his wishes. I'm at the point now that I don't want to hear her complain anymore about it. \n\nMy boyfriend and I keep telling her that he needs rehab. Really bad. She's always saying no and doesn't want to be \"responsible\" for it. She also said that he'll be mad at her if she did take him in and doesn't want that. We are warning her that she would be responsible if something happens. He seriously... needs... help... \n\nI try to make plans with her to hang out. When we do, she always says \"oh C is coming over\" or \"C wants to do this.\" Everything is about him. I was having a bad weekend a few weeks ago and I needed her. She said she could come over tomorrow, which was a Saturday. So I waited. She messaged me that she was going hiking with C and then she'll come over. I was initially bugged but I just let her go. It got late. And later. And later. She messaged me that C is passed out on the trail and waiting for him to snap out of it. I got pissed. He eventually came to and they left the mountain but then he wanted her to take him to his place so that he can pay rent and then take him back to her place. That would take her a while. She complained to me she didn't want to do it and I told her to not do it. But... Lo and behold, she did. I got so mad cuz I needed a friend that day when she said she would be there for me. I said really nasty stuff to her about him and that I'm sick of his shit. She told me I was being very rude and that she didn't want to hear it. So fine but at least I said something. \n\nThe same kind of things still happen with C when it comes to hanging out over the weeks. Last night was the final straw. I was in the middle of a video call with her and I was trying to show her something but then her head was turned cuz C, of course C, was talking to her. I waited. I waited. I went to the bathroom, came out and still, I waited and waited. She's still talking to him. I finally hung up. She finally messaged me a few minutes later saying that I hung up on her. I told her my reasons. I even told her that our friendship is hurting now. She asked what I meant and I tried telling her. She just doesn't understand what I'm saying. \n\nI haven't talked to her much since and I just don't want to. It's that her attention is all on him and I'm sick of it. I've tried telling her and she just says he's family. I \nI get that but we're practically sisters so am I not family to her?  I just don't know what to do now. Any advice?? \n\nTL:DR best friend of over 25 years is giving a 20 year old drunk and addict more attention and it's hurting our friendship.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

As a lone child who really suffered the lack of siblings, that was and still is my everything. \nI also love animals, memes, food, traveling, videogames, roleplay, books, ancient myths and languages and, well, the list is long. \n\nIt may sound unusual but, even if I am a bit of an introvert, I really like people and I am very open to friendships with everyone!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I\u2019ve noticed that she\u2019s been kind of different and distant after the argument even over text. I asked her why she was acting weird, but she got pissed and said nothing was wrong and that I\u2019m overthinking things. When you text someone every single day and get used to the way they talk, you know something is off when their texting style is different. She was normally very talkative, prompt and kind of annoying when it came to texting me. Or when I wouldn\u2019t text her because I was busy or something, she\u2019d tell me over the phone that she was checking her phone waiting for my reply and wondering why I wasn\u2019t texting her back. She also brought up the fact that I never texted \u201cgood morning\u201d and she always had to. But yeah, she\u2019s now giving such dry responses and hours apart too which is a complete change. Of course I notice that things are off. Also, any chance she\u2019d get, she would call me; on her drive to work, while she\u2019s going to the washroom at work, while she\u2019s going to grab food at work, while she\u2019s driving home from work, while she\u2019s shopping trying jeans on for over an hour...while doing anything! Now, nothing. \n\nDuring our argument last week, she said she didn\u2019t want us to talk anymore. Her saying we should stop talking or stop being friends is her go to thing to say when we hit a rough patch in our friendship and I never understand why. It\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t care about the friendship and is willing to throw it away over a fight. I got pretty tired of hearing her say that so I asked if she really wanted to end the friendship or just stop talking for a while until things blew over. She replied with \u201cidk\u201d after me asking 3 times. I said to just let me know when she knows and that was that. Then today she texts me saying stuff like, \u201cfriends don\u2019t always have to be talking to each other every day or micro managing one another\u201d, \u201cif we stop talking, we stop talking. I shouldn\u2019t have to explain to you why I\u2019m not messaging you\u201d among more bull she was spewing. I hated how she was making me sound clingy when it\u2019s the other way around. I want to also bring up the fact that she hates my other close friend. She told be a while ago that she thinks my friend is trying to \u201csteal me away\u201d from her. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because she just recently got back together with her boyfriend and now feels like friends aren\u2019t that important; they were only important when she didn\u2019t have him and needed the void to be filled. I feel like I was being used because she was lonely and didn\u2019t have any other friends. I helped her so much especially financially while she was broken up with her boyfriend. One text/one phone call, I sent her money right away even while I was at work a few times. I guess right now I\u2019m just venting because the more I think and write, the more I\u2019m pissed I\u2019m getting. How can people be like this? \n\nBut as much as I know I don\u2019t want to have her as a friend, I don\u2019t know how to let go without being hurt and missing her. Honestly, every time her and I argue and she threatens to end the friendship, I get upset and fear the thought of not having her in my life anymore, so I always apologize first. I know I\u2019m being taken advantage of, but I shake it off and think maybe she\u2019s not as bad as I think she is because when we\u2019re good, we\u2019re really good. We\u2019re always being stupid together and laughing and enjoy hanging out with each other. She\u2019s probably the only one who knows me as well as my mom knows me. I also think maybe she\u2019s the way she is because she didn\u2019t have a great childhood at all. \n\nThe little story is all over the place (sorry), but this definitely felt good to express. Any insights or anything is very much appreciated!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

My memory of how the events unrolled are a bit foggy, but I\u2019ll do my best to retell the story. Sorry for the length.\n\nAbout three years ago, I met Charlotte (fake name for privacy) through a mutual group chat on a messaging app. At first I didn\u2019t get along with her, but over the months I guess we just clicked and became friends. Eventually, she created her own exclusive friend group chat where I fondly remember having a ton of good memories just interacting with Charlotte and some other good internet friends. As always, all good times come to an end, meaning that the group chat soon, well, died. However, I still maintained my relationship with Charlotte talking to her over another app. Considering how she still saw me as one of her best and closest internet friends, I really valued Charlotte and would often check on her to say hello and all that since we didn\u2019t talk as much. This was especially important as she dealt with a lot of mental struggles and was in a crappy living situation with her family.\n\nOne day, Charlotte messages me about something more interesting. She explained an irl friend of hers had a bundle of merchandise from a stupid franchise I loved a few years back, and that they were offering to give it away for free to anyone. Being clearly ecstatic, I gladly oblige, because who doesn\u2019t want free stuff? Especially when it\u2019s estimated to have a hundred dollar value, too. I was added into a group chat with the friend and Charlotte and she explains the situation. The only money exception was shipping, as I live on the other side of the country from where Charlotte and her friend live. Due to the fact that I just recently got my debit card (mfw being 15), I was a bit cautious. Why? Well, I have a strict Asian mom, and, uh, she checks my card transactions.. a lot. I was unsure of how I could explain randomly paying money to someone of some other state to my mother, so I sorta backed out. Until, Charlotte gracefully offered to pay out of her own pocket for the shipping. I felt guilty, but gratefully went along with it and gave her my address to set everything up. Charlotte\u2019s friend then arranged to drop off the bundle at Charlotte\u2019s house, so Charlotte could ship it out to my address. Unfortunately Charlotte explained she was short with cash, but promised to bring the package to the post as soon as she could.\n\nTwo months later.. and no response nor update. I felt partially responsible, as doing this favor probably wasn\u2019t one of Charlotte\u2019s top priorities, due to herself being responsible for shipping the package. I messaged her that I found a better way to send money less suspiciously through a finance app, along with offering to pay for the shipping of the package myself instead of what was originally out of pocket for Charlotte. She admitted she forgot about sending my package (which was understandable coming from my assumptions) and agreed to my offer in paying instead. She downloaded the app, and I sent her twelve dollars. All was good and settled. Hopefully, because I actually paid myself for what I was to receive she\u2019d feel more obliged to go and deliver it then, maybe? I was kinda sure, yet unsure. I still continued to send her feedback and support on her occasional vents, as we were obviously still good friends. I also figured Charlotte\u2019s decreasing mental health was taking a massive toll upon her to go to the post office and send in the package.\n\nAnother two months go by and she still hasn\u2019t replied to any of my responses, and neither has she even opened them. Charlotte was still active on her account, so I already knew she was most likely to purposely not open my messages. I decided to shoot a message again about the package, while also avoiding being pushy. I offered out a deal that she instead gave the twelve dollars and package back to her friend, so she wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the stress of having to go out of her way for my own sake. Still no signs of her opening the message. The last message I sent to her was an irrelevant response to one of her stories a month ago, and to this day, she still hasn\u2019t responded nor opened my messages.\n\nThis is exhausting. I feel like I really closed off a good internet relationship just for money and a package. I\u2019m just confused and hurt, since I wish Charlotte could at least open my messages and tell me how she was feeling, or at least give back the money I had sent her while she\u2019s posting about something else she bought on her account. I know twelve dollars isn\u2019t a lot and is a pretty stupid low amount to get riled up about, but I don\u2019t have a job yet, and my family is also kinda poor, so money is super valuable to me. I really don\u2019t want to block Charlotte or cut her off over this situation, since I still have hopes that maybe she\u2019ll remember about it someday and randomly send out the package there and then. I\u2019m also not exactly sure of how terrible her mental health is currently. But then comes the other thoughts that maybe I should end the friendship over this ordeal because of how she\u2019s been suddenly nonexistent towards me. There\u2019s also the possibility that she won\u2019t send off the package and I\u2019ll just be stuck being short of twelve dollars that I could have used on something else. Who even knows what Charlotte has done with the bundle by now. I feel I\u2019ve done everything I could to politely approach about the package, including an attempt to reach out to the account aka presumed dead alt of that friend who was originally offering out the merchandise in the first place. For some reason I can\u2019t find any evidence of my message to that friend\u2019s account, so I can only assume the chances that they either deactivated or, for the worst, blocked me. I don\u2019t exactly remember their username and also can\u2019t find the group chat about the bundle made between them, me, and Charlotte.\n\nI really don\u2019t know what to do, and my goals as of now are to just get my money back and restore our friendship. I seriously want to talk to Charlotte again, but I fear that she\u2019ll still believe I\u2019m referencing the package, then ignore me again. My options are running out.

Someone with an ideal they were willing to strive for; a part of themself they held-firm for someone special. Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of option, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person. \n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers). \n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values). \n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

Dont want to not be her friend due to her being the only friend i have and because i love her dad as my own dad and it would be weird if we still had the dad/daughter relationship when hes the only one id be friends with in the family.\n\n\nrecently my friend (c) went to a different part of the country with her other friend (n) for 4 days and has changed drastically since. Now ive been getting pretty annoyed with c for quite some time now since she wont cop on and keeps acting like a child. This finally came back to bite me in the ass since i never talked to her about it and now its too late to do so. While she was gone she became good friends with n again and became good friends and even developed a crush on my ex who tried to rape me. She knows what my ex is like, not only has she witnessed it ive also told her about it.\n\n\nshit starts the day sh e comes back, a sunday. all of sunday, monday and tuesday i tried to get in contact with c so we could hang out and catch up with what she did over the time she was gone, she lied to me over those days that she was busy or gone when in reality she was hanging out with n, got this info from dad. i get over it since its not the first time and i dont care that much. Come wednesday theres a funfair and c wants me to come with her and n, at the funfair my ex and some of the rest of his group show up. After the funfair we all head to n's house to chill, c asked me to come with. The whole time i was there i was left out and unwanted by everyone including c. While i was there though i noticed c get really close to my ex and leaning on him, once the lights were off when we watched a movie my ex had his hands on c. I went ballistic and kept giving them 'the look'. mot long after this i left and thought out how to talk to my friend about this. Next day text dad to send c down so i can talk to her, long story short, i told her i wouldnt let her date him and she had to choose, me or him. she chose me. Next day we meet up with one of my friends, which she agreed to. The whole time hanging out with this friend she was all moody and bitchy and i told her to grow up and talk to me and tell me whats wrong. Skip forward a bit we all go to the funfair again and the whole time shes ignoring me and trying to stay away from me. On the way back she ditches me and her promise for a sleepover for n and the rest of the group.\n\n\non saturday we hung out late in the evening beacause n went to work and had a sleepover but the WHOLE TIME she was texting n and my ex on snapchat. she didnt really talk to me but had plenty to say to them. on sunday she leaves not long after we woke up and i dont hear from her again until late monday cause n is at work again and again the whole time she just ignores me and texts n and my ex. Today she made mecome up to hers cause its her dogs birthday but the whole time she ignored me and didnt talk to me and stayed away from me and was talking and sitting with n until they both suddenly dissapeared.\n\n\nmy problem is that i feel very left out, betrayed and worse than second best, she comes to me as a last  resort since she came back. i got intel from dad that n has been talking shit behid my back to c and c doesnt do anything or care. i really do try to be friends with everyone but n hates me for some unknown reason. i feel so worthless due to this, i dont know what to do since c is the only friend i have and her dad is the only dad i have.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "cebpyw", "created_utc": 1563363833, "title": "Advice needed (Long post)", "author": "ablue_flame", "self_text": "Note: I typed this on my phone so please don't mind the grammar or spelling errors\n\nI'm a 19 year old college-going guy. I reconnected with a friend of mine from school after joining my college. S(We were the same school for 9 years and same class for 1 of those 9 years). We happened join the same college, but different branches of engineering. We got really close within 3-4 months of meeting (we knew each other's phone and laptop passwords. I use that to describe how close we were because of how rarely that kind of information is shared with others) .We used to hangout in the library and \u00a0spendstudy and together and spend almost all free time together. I'm not very good at making friends and have been so since school. So this was a new and exciting experience for me. Someone from my school, who could understand me and have fun with me like this, was kind of surreal.\u00a0\nIt was around December last year, and we were back home for vacation and we were texting, while she brought up her parents. She mentioned that they're not okay with her dating guys while away from home. (Also because they're overprotective and upper middle class teens in India aren't usually free to date people). She also didn't feel good about lying to her parents or anyone close to her.\nShe was very sure that her parents had some reason and she wanted to respect that. She mentioned that she'd start going out only once she turns 22, because she'll have graduated and employed by then.\u00a0\nDuring a similar conversation, later, she told me that she trusts me a lot and that I've to make sure she doesn't get distracted or start going out with anyone, because it'd cause problems for her (not just her parents)\nShe specifically told me that she will get carried away and convinced by a lot of guys (she's a very attractive girl) to go out (she used the words \"I'll be brainwashed\", so ur seemed very serious and important for her). I was initially against forcing or suppressing one's own emotions for whatever reasons like that, but she seemed pretty convinced that that's what she wanted. So I agreed to, in her words, \"talk some sense into her and do whatever's necessary, if ever I got to know that she was going out with someone\"\nSkip to January, we were studying in a classroom by ourselves and we realized we both wanted to prepare for the same competitive exams and pursue a career as government officials. We decided we'd start preparing from this August. Also, we realized we were very similar growing up, and how lucky we were to find a friend like this who just 'gets it'.\u00a0\nMid January, she texted me and told me that she was feeling attracted to this senior who stood up for her when some other seniors tried to find out things about her without her permission. So I reminded her that in such a situation, she wanted me to 'talk her out of it' and I did that. I reminded her of her goals and everything else she was worried about. We both argued and ended up crying because we both hated what we were doing in that situation. So I told her that I don't want to hurt her feelings in any way, and that I'd stay out of this for a while. But she insisted that I do my best and repeat this, the next time she felt that way towards someone.\nBut towards the end of January, there was a food fest organized by our profs and I wanted to go with her, my best friend. But she suddenly told me that she wanted to go with this guy from her class who'd been showing interest in her for sometime. We kinda argued that day and I got worried that I might have to 'talk some sense into her', but I did nothing like that and just let it go.\nThat week, she went out with a different guy each day, almost everyday. This got me worried. So we had a conversation in which I reminded her that she wanted me to talk her out of such things. We fought that day and didn't speak for a couple of days. After that, I texted her one day to tell her something good that happened with me that day, but apparently she was out with some guy.\u00a0\nThat guy, was a final year mechanical engineering student(22 year old) from our college. The next few days she went out with that same guy and claimed to have found a spark between them. She told me that this guy shared his story about depression and a near-suicide attempt when they met for the third or fourth time. I didn't feel right about that, because things like that are very personal and sharing it with a younger date this early, was not normal according to me. But I didn't say anything and I just kept listening everytime she said anything about him.\nOne day she called me panicking that this guy was ill because he didn't have enough lunch (because his friends ate it). So I told her that it'd be okay and that he had friends in his dorm who'd take care of him. And then she started praising him, telling that he doesn't feel restricted and is a very confident guy, and he's sometimes childish and she likes that and on and on. This was sometime after a week they'd met. (I think they got close because of the same mother tongue and same culture that they follow and that he apparently studied in the same institute in which my friend studied, but a different branch)\nAfter that day, they started going to different tourist spots and he claimed to be 'showing her different places'.\nOne day, I went to the beach (which is very near to our college) with my friends, and saw them sitting there. It'd been a couple of days since I'd spoken to my friend. So I directly went to them and she herself asked me if I wanted to talk and I said yes and we spoke. I was very angry at her and I told her that this is a mess I didn't want to get into and because she wanted me to 'talk her out of' things, I'd been put in a really bad situation. I told her that she should listen to me and think about what would happen to her after this final year guy graduated (apparently he was going to Germany for further studies). So knowing her, I told her that it'd affect her badly and she'd have a hard time getting on with her usual life. She yelled at me calling me toxic and that I should mind my own business and that really pissed me off. We were best friends and I was hurt that she could say things like that. Then I spoke to that final year guy, and told him what she'd asked me to do and that her situation would be bad after he leaves. I was hoping he'd say something about making their relationship long distance, because at least then, she wouldn't get hurt. (I know it sounds crazy, but she was the one close friend that I had, and I wouldn't let her get hurt because of that)\nBut he started telling me that he understands my position and he told me about his experience with suicide and depression (this was the first time we met and he told me that! This made me feel really weird. Who shares such personal things with a stranger you met literally 30 mins ago!?)\nThen he told some incoherent stories about him dating a girl younger than him by a year and how it got toxic because he spent all his time with her. And just a few minutes after that, he tells me that he's been lonely for 4 years without a close relationship and that he finds my friend attractive and that he loves her a lot. After that I couldn't control my emotions and I cried in front of that guy and my friend. I cried telling out loud that she was the only close friend of mine and I couldn't bear seeing her get hurt if anything happened to her. I felt really embarrassed after that and I left the beach.\u00a0\nThat experience really hit me hard and it affected my grades and I scored less than what I'd usually score, which made me feel worse. By this time, there was no communication between me and my best friend. And my other friends all advised me to just let her do whatever she wants and that she'd learn for herself. But I couldn't keep it to myself, and I spoke to a couple of profs and teachers and they advised me to do the same. One teacher of mine told me that she'd talk to her parents about it and I told her that they wouldn't take it well. But she told me that she'd just inform them that she was acting very distracted. Idk if she actually called them up. But my best friend texted me next day asking me if I'd talked to her parents like that. So I told her that I never had any means of contacting them. She then told me that she'd find out somehow who did it.\nOne day towards mid April, i was returning from the library, it was dark, and I saw someone that looked like my best friend, walking by herself, \u00a0I felt a weird thing. I almost fell short of breath and nearly collapsed. But I managed to get back to my room and take rest, because I thought that was fatigue. But the next day I actually saw her walking with the final year guy, and I had an experience similar to the previous one, but only worse. That day I cried a lot and texted her asking her why she'd been treating me like that and apologized for no specific reason. That day she told me that she was ready to forget everything that had happened but she still couldn't hang out with me anymore, like she used to. When I asked her why she told me that she didn't feel like spending time with anyone other than the final year guy. After a few days, she texted me asking for her textbooks back and she wanted to return my textbooks we'd exchanged a few months ago. Because of what I experienced the last time I saw her, I sent the books with a friend for exchanging. We haven't spoken since.\nI feel really bad for what happened. I just don't know what happened. She always refused to talk about it even. And now it seems like we're not even friends now. I cried so many times wondering what I screwed up so badly, for this to happen. I still don't know if we'll ever be that close again, and that hurts real bad.\nAll of what I've said might mean that I'm a bad friend but please trust me, I only mean good for my best friend. I'm ready to accept and correct whatever mistakes I made. I just need someone to take a look at this series of incidents and tell me what I could've done better. Also, I badly want my friend back. So can you please suggest anything that I could do, that would make up for the mistakes I've made?\n\nPS : I forgot to mention that our academic year ends in April and that the final year guy and my friend would have only 2 months at max to spend even if they decided to make it an official relationship. I don't know if that's enough time to get to know someone well enough for a good relationship.\u00a0\nThis was another thing that bothered me a lot!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

As I\u2019ve gotten older, I understand that people have their own way of reacting. With her, I feel like I hold back my true self in our to shield myself from taking offense. (Maybe this is my own problem for being too sensitive?) \n\n- I feel like I give a lot more than I get. I am a listener and a very empathetic person but sometime a simple how have you been is hard to get from her... \n\n- I find her annoying sometimes.  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s me, I have grown and taken interest in other things/react differently but we are opposite in almost everything. She is loud and I am a very quiet person. I feel like I can never match her energy and she always says, \u201cI need to find someone to match my energy.\u201d \n\nThat being said, she is supportive of me. I do care for her as a person but I don\u2019t think our personality match or mesh well. HOW DO I BREAK THIS TO HER WITHOUT BEING RUDE OR ATTACKING HER CHARACTER? How do you tell someone they are toxic but in a nice way? Should I just set boundaries in our friendship? \n\nRight now, I asked her if I could have some time to think things through about our friendship. We both know that we have had ups and some downs as friends. She was really respectful and allowed us to have space. I can\u2019t tell if I am okay to have her out of my life or not... I am worried to explain this to her and her ask me to provide examples or reason why I believe she\u2019s toxic. I do have some but it\u2019s mostly a feeling I have. I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nWe have a class together next semester. PLS HELP.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Me and Brad met when we joined the same band. Turns out that besides liking music, we both like videogames and Brad invites me and Chad, the other member of the band, to play Apex Legends.\n\nI don't really like shooters but I decided to give it a try. We had a really great time, it was fun and there was good banter, even if we lost most of the times. However, Chad and me got tired of loosing and proposed to find other F2P games. We decided on Warframe.\n\nChad and me really liked it, but Brad... He went completely silent on the mic, playing as if he was alone, almost ignoring us. It was akward, so we quit the game. \n\nA few days later we cancelled band practice and gathered in my place to play videogames, eat pizza and get drunk. We played sekiro for a few hours, passing the controller around and everything was cool, we were having fun. As the night went on, I got tired of it and asked the guys (brad and chad) if the want to play SSBU. Chad said yes, but Brad said in the most apathetic way possible \"I don't know how to play\". So Chad said we would teach him and that it would be fun.\n\nWe tried, but Brad didn't like the game and did not even try to play. He just did whatever, constantly jumping offstage to his death, while being completely silent. That killed the night.\n\nAnd I noticed in that moment, he always does the same thing whenever something does not go the way he wants. It happens all the time, if we do something at band practice that he doesn't like, he goes silent for the rest of the night, replying only with \"yes\", \"no\" and \"hmm\" to our questions.\n\nHe also likes ordering us around.

He'll text us something like \"we're having band practice on Tuesday\" and when we say we can't, that we have other things to do, he'll go \"You can do those things some other day, it would be great if you could make it on Tuesday, you're supposed to have a compromise with the band\" and blablabla.\n\nWhat can I do about this guy?

My favorite type of books are apocalyptic dystopian novels such as On the beach by Nevil Shute.

{"post_id": "cejb76", "created_utc": 1563399671, "title": "[16M] The world of Christian Flat-Earthers", "author": "mnm_31", "self_text": "Once upon a time, I was watching The Office on some shady streaming site. Now, if you\u2019ve ever been to that sort of place, you know the ads really scrape the bottom of the barrel. Most of the time, you get shitty Spanish rap videos or something. Well, once in a while, you find some real gems in there. My favorite by far was this dude in his late 30s in a poorly lit room trying to sell t-shirts that have a list of 200 Bible verses that confirm the Earth is flat. At first, I assumed this had to be an elaborate troll. Of course, I\u2019ve seen crazy Christians who are way into it, and I\u2019ve seen crazy Flat Earthers as well. However, after following this man\u2019s actions for about a year and a half now, I am fully convinced of his insanity.\n\nWelcome to the word of Nathan Roberts, also known as \u201cFlat Earth Doctrine\u201d on YouTube. This man is truly devoted to his cause, as some days he will spend *hours* livestreaming. I am convinced he must not have a job. Somehow, he does have a wife and two kids, but anyway. When I first looked into him after discovering this ad, I quickly came upon his book on Amazon, the reviews of which are a true goldmine. He has a very extensive library of videos and articles surrounding his thoughts on the shape of the Earth, so I\u2019ll just hit some highlights of interesting tidbits and stories surrounding my experiences with Nathan.\n\n1. The term \u201cflat earther\u201d is the devil, since \u201cflat earther\u201d refers to people who use pesky science to determine the Earth is flat. He prefers the term \u201cbiblical earther\u201d, as this refers to people like him who  use Bible verses and faith to determine this. Despite this, he still does his own science experiments from time to time.\n\n2. He frequently features other channels on his own, and calls out other \u201cbiblical earthers\u201d for not having solid enough faith or something. Yes, there is a flat earther/biblical earther ecosystem on YouTube.\n\n3. During a lunar eclipse several months ago, Nathan went into the yard with his camera and filmed it for a few hours. This is perhaps the greatest livestream I have ever experienced. The chat is just about as insane as he is. Moderated by his clearly rather young children, the people in the chat were telling me all about how stars are actually angels and how space doesn\u2019t exist. Toward the end, I was telling people that the eclipse is caused by the government resetting the moon CGI, but I\u2019m not sure if anyone believed me. Anyway, after filming for several hours, he and his kids had a nice book burning. Overall, I would rate my Flat Earth Doctrine eclipse livestream experience an 11/10.\n\n4. One time, he made a video outside of a library showing this pillar and dome combo that was part of the architecture. He claims this is clear evidence that the architect was a biblical earther, since this is supposedly how the Bible describes the Earth.\n\n5. Most of his 200+ verses are just phrases like \u201cthe length of the Earth\u201d or \u201cthe four corners of the Earth\u201d.\n\n6. He frequently attends meetups several states away with like-minded individuals. I do not know how he has the time or money for this.\n\n7. A very common flat earther/biblical earther YouTuber tactic is to make hella business cards with information pertaining to flat earth theories and go into a business, handing them out to everyone. This is referred to as \u201cFlat Smacking\u201d. One time, Nathan did it in a mall dressed as Santa Claus and got kicked out. He also sang Christmas Songs with the lyrics changed to a flat Earth theme. The parents just kinda watched and politely smiled.\n\nPlease check out Flat Earth Doctrine on YouTube and drop a sub, he\u2019s at around 20k and could use your support.

I\u2019m thinking of writing the full story of our friendship to try and process it and share what 7 years down the drain feels like.\n\nI met this girl when I moved schools. I remember that she put construction paper on her case which our teachers told us not to. She said \u201cI don\u2019t care I do what I want.\u201d It made me a little uncomfortable. But months later we were friends.\n\nIn 8th grade the world changed. Everyone was fighting over boys. Over girls. I was never involved. But I followed. And because of that... I lost the friends she did, and gained the enemies she did.\n\nFreshman year the boys got older. Too old really. I followed. I said they were cute. I said she was cute with them. I didn\u2019t know better. Even after I started talking to them myself.\n\nShe found what she was good at. We were in marching band together. Marching was one of the most fulfilling activities I have ever partaken in. She told me I wasn\u2019t doing it right. She told me I didn\u2019t have enough muscle. She told me I was the weak one. I was hurt. I thought I was embarrassing. But she told me that\u2019s just where I fit in the world.\n\nShe was a good friend. But she wanted more when we turned 16. Our friends had, cars.. jobs.. She wanted that without the work. She would ask for people to buy things. She would take belongings. And soon she just started expecting that.\n\nI met my boyfriend when I was 16. He told me he couldn\u2019t financially be friends with her.  She wouldn\u2019t pay for anything herself. I talked to my other friends. We told her to stop. She did.\n\nWhen we were in 8th grade, I was in a trio with another friend. But over the summer of my sophomore year, that changed. She became the enemy. \n\nSenior year, the other girl was in my art class. It was a great friendship. Like old times. But my best friend kept spreading rumors. Ruining the other girls reputation. Over all that time.. they wouldn\u2019t speak face to face.\n\nI told my best friend about the relationship with the other girl. I put my foot down. I said her problems were not mine anymore. And that this person was also my friend. She complied.\n\nSenior year my best friend met a guy. He was nice at first. But it became apparent after we started college that he was not. He controlled her. He manipulated her. She knew it too. I tried to tell her to leave. To get out of the situation. She wouldn\u2019t. So instead... for my safety.. I left.\n\nAfter Christmas that same year she contacted me. She said it was over between them. She wanted me back. I was elated. She came to my house. She told me about their fights. It was great. I had my best friend back. \n\nWe made two more friends. We were all four a team. An unstoppable force of art students. I was happy. I was safe. But things obviously changed.\n\nHer boyfriend came back. Apologies and all. She accepted. She reassured me it wouldn\u2019t be the same. I followed.\n\nI gave him a chance. I spent time with my best friend one night. And he came over. He yelled at me. Accused me of stealing his girlfriend from him. I was terrified. I hardly knew him. Or what I got myself into. I put my foot down again. I told him she was mine first. That she cares for me first. He left. But they didn\u2019t seperate.\n\nI thought I was cared about first. But in the weeks to come she had to make a decision. Him or her friends. And she chose him.\n\nEvery few weeks we would pull her back. She would say she would hold her ground. He would yell. He would manipulate. She didn\u2019t speak. We thought she was doing it. She was standing up. But she was really following along.\n\nSummer came. Personally.. I lost myself. I knew I didn\u2019t want her drama in my life. I didn\u2019t have the strength to tell her why I wasn\u2019t replying to her messages. I should have told her. I didn\u2019t.\n\nThe fall semester rolled around.  We had a class together. She sat across the room... with my friend. I was alone.\n\nI stayed by myself all week. Feeling sorry that I lost my other friends to her.\n\nThursday I tried to talk. She told me I was a shitty friend. And that real friends don\u2019t leave. I cried.\n\nI talked to her that afternoon with my other friend. They told me I was being stupid. I need my best friend. I can\u2019t leave my best friend. That\u2019s not what best friends do. So... I stayed.\n\nShe was still with her boyfriend. She said over the summer, he became more understanding. That wasn\u2019t true. He kept on. She kept picking him. Until finally. Finally. It fizzled. And popped. And they broke up. For good.\n\nMy friends were so happy. Our original group of four, out to conquer the world. Without a distraction on her part. But something changed.\n\nShe changed. Her morals changed. Her attitude changed. She became desperate. She became impulsive. She became pushy.\n\nI tried to hold it in. I tried to stay true.  Be a good friend. Be a BEST friend. Encourage her. Follow her.\n\nHer splashes became waves. It was small and annoying waves at first. But then they grew to become bigger problems.\n\nWe tried to warn her of herself. We tried to tell her she was acting different. We tried to tell her that she was better than this.\n\nShe chose herself over us. She crossed lines. She broke trust. She crumpled up the perfect paper that had been our friendship into a tight ball for the last time.\n\nOne of my friends cut ties. She still cared about her. But my friend needed to protect herself. Myself and my other friend agreed. We would keep our distance.\n\nI became close with my other friends. In just a few short months... I saw a friendships where I didn\u2019t have to follow. I lead. They lead. We did not influence each other\u2019s choices. We encouraged. We built each other up. Made towers out of ourselves. And soon... I was calling one of them my best friend.\n\nOut friendship isn\u2019t work. It\u2019s genuine.\nIt flows as easy as water, and the laughter comes naturally. We made each other better people.\nShe didn\u2019t understand why I followed. She showed me how to be strong. How to put my foot down.\n\nWe kept our distance for a while. She would insist on hanging out. We would say we forgot. She would insist on spending time with the friend who cut ties. We were confused. We said we were busy.\n\nWe made sure she was ok. We made friendly small talk. Referencing to the days before everything crumbled.\n\nBut yesterday. Something changed. Obviously.\n\nShe posted passive aggressive pictures online. I tried to figure it out. I asked my friends what they thought. My new best friend was blocked. It was directed towards her. She was furious.\n\nShe messaged my old best friend.\n\nWhy are you upset. Why did this happen. Who is telling you all of this? It\u2019s not true. Why do you believe it?\n\nShe told my new best friend.. that she was manipulating me. That I was a kind hearted person, and that I was being taken advantage of. But... I realized... that\u2019s the opposite.\n\nYou see Desi lifts me up. She shows me how to get angry when people hurt me and stand up for myself instead of being sad and wishing for people to help. You on the other hand. You knew I was a kind hearted soul. You knew I was weak. So instead of building me up. You pulled me around on a leash. I was always the sidekick. The weak one. I\u2019d like to think you never meant to hurt me. But you did. And I told you it did.\nAnd I told you what was wrong because you should know. But it gets hard when I have to have a talk with you once a week about the things you do to hurt me.\nAnd I don\u2019t understand why you think this is some kind of fight to win over friendship.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t work out. It doesn\u2019t work out. We didn\u2019t hate you, we didn\u2019t talk shit. You hurt us, and yeah, we were mad.. But we kept that between ourselves. To protect you from having to deal with angry nonsense.   No one was your enemy, until you started talking about them like they were. We were away, but there for you.  If you were in danger, we would help. We wanted you to make new friends, and meet someone new, and fall in love and have a happy life. But when you crumple up a piece of paper, you can\u2019t make it flat again.\n\nSo yes. I came to you. I put my foot down. I told you that I didn\u2019t believe you anymore. You already ruined our trust a long time ago. You act like these issues are small. But if you want to look at all the drama.. especially from the people who have known you the longest. You can only break people\u2019s trust so many times. I am happy where I am.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Bands like Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots, Nirvana and Pear Jam really ring my bell. I love a lot of other bands and music genres as well, too much to list!

If anybody would like to show me their pets, feel free to do so. \n\n\u2022 I have an accent, lotta folk around these threads seem to really appreciate them. So I think it\u2019s good I have one...???\n\n\u2022I\u2019m 17 and I am a MALE SPECIMEN \n\nI think I\u2019m starting to drag this out and sound retarded.....ooopsy\n\nAll in all it\u2019s a very generic post - but I\u2019ll stick with it. \n\nIf you read this far then you\u2019re either just killing time by reading these or genuinely want to contact me, being said if that\u2019s the case don\u2019t be hesitant to do so!\n\nNote: \n\nI don\u2019t mind who you are, don\u2019t care if you\u2019re gay, lesbian, bisexual, black, trans, religious, etc you get the picture. \n\nI\u2019d also like to point out that I\u2019m from the UK, anybody can message me no matter where you\u2019re from, just keep timezones in mind. I\u2019m preferable to people in the UK and Europe or any country in a close time zone but all are free to message. \n\nI use Discord, Chatsnap, Kik, Instagram, iMessage - so there\u2019s plenty of options there.

We have had a long history (the leaders) and have come away with several relationships that have lasted a long time. Most of us just chat when we have time and want to talk, and we talk about various things. Some subjects that come to mind: banter, our daily lives, politics, and real world stuff in general. We are all very diverse of interest, and all of us are active (we remove inactive people, who don't invest time.) I would say we have a good split of US and EU people, as well as a nice spot of Australians/SEA , and also Men/Woman ratio.\n\nWhat we're looking for is genuine people, who want to make long lasting friendships. The type of person who comes in to the chat and interacts with us, not just posts a meme and leave. If you're shy, socially awkward, we get it. We will allow you time to open up, and none of us are very judge-y. If you're coming in to this community, get ready to explore a world of genuine people with real thoughts and feelings, this is not a meme fest, although it can be. We have several channels and topics of discussions going on, and we're quite active as a rule - politics, not safe, selfies, introductions etc. Introducing yourself and showing yourself are highly encouraged, though not mandatory.\n\nIdeally you will be:\n\n\\- Honest (I do not want meme personalities or personas here. If you have crippling depression we get it, but be yourself.)\n\n\\- Interactive\n\n\\- Willing to voice chat sometimes or be very text-active\n\n\\- Authentic\n\n\\- Be looking for real friends from real people\n\n\\- An adult\n\nThis community is based on that, community - it's not a chat room. We're cultivating friendship, working on talking to each other, getting to know each other etc. Personalities will clash, not everyone will like each other and that's fine.

I really need some insight or advice. \n\nI\u2019ve( 36m) worked with a woman (35f) for around 5 years. Started out as just co-workers, nice to each other, got along good etc. The last 1.5 years though, after a promotion and getting to work beside her, we\u2019ve really become great friends. I consider her in my top 3 for friends, she\u2019s expressed the same. \n\nWe talk about everything under the sun. Help each other out etc at work. Her husband works away, home every few weeks for a week, I am also married. We both have kids roughly the same age. We\u2019ve socialized with our families some, not as much as we\u2019d both like, but with her guy working away, it\u2019s harder. Just putting that out there, I know some people might think I lust for her, but I don\u2019t. I really don\u2019t. \n\nAnyway. We text a lot after hours, go for drinks. Stuff friends do. We aren\u2019t just coworkers. Our spouses are aware. Everything is on the up and up here\n\nShe had to take some personal time recently, returning a month from now, which left a huge void at work, as I expected. What I didn\u2019t expect was for her to not chat as much with me. It\u2019s going on 3 months now and we text a bit still, but not nearly as much. Like I said, we used to talk about everything, but I ask her how she is, ask her about the reason she\u2019s off, which I know, but she doesn\u2019t seem to want to talk about the personal stuff anymore. I am trying to be supportive and understanding. \n\nShe keeps telling me that we need to get together and she wants to talk about a million things face to face, which I would rather do than text for sure. But for 3 months I\u2019ve kept suggesting times for meet ups, lunch, a beer. Supper with our families. She hadn\u2019t had time is the answer I get\n\nI know she\u2019s going through hell right now, and I was always there before for her, and she is genuinely appreciative. But lately I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. She keeps saying soon we\u2019ll get together. But it never happens. Maybe I expect too much? But I\u2019m not expecting anything more than what we used to have. \n\nShe has phoned me a few times the last couple weeks, which has been nice. And she says she misses me and that. But I guess when you go from seeing your best friend 8+ hours a day, then texting most nights or hanging out once in awhile, it\u2019s not the same. I just want it to be like it was. And I don\u2019t know what changed\n\nAnyway, it makes me feel pretty shitty to be putting so much effort into it and not seeing much returned. She is worth the effort, but not sure how much longer I can do it, getting pretty frustrated. Thanks for reading. Take care\n\nTL;DR\nBest friend took leave from work and doesn\u2019t seem to want to talk about life anymore.

Seconds later i got a boner because of the gloves. She is gorgeous , pretty, sexy, intelligent and looks so kinky with those gloves on her sexy hands but because of my boner she realized and understood that i have a fetish for this. She laughed at me and I was humilaiated and horny at the same time. Dont know how to explain this.It was nice and bad at the same time , nice because of the gloves , bad because of the fact that she wears them not to do me a favour, but because she is grossed out.Now she wants to give me a pity handjob with the gloves .She says it would be a win win situation, she doesnt touch my filth and I get sexual statisfaction. But I dont know. I made the deal to take a bath before so that she wears the gloves only for me not for her, but she explained that she would wear the gloves\nin principle for giving me a handjob if i am gross ore not because she doesnt want to touch a penis from a man who is not attractive for her in general. But she would chill with me without gloves when i take a bath .So what do especially the young women in this forum think about this.

So I just dropped out of high school and I\u2019m starting a disability support course at TAFE (like college) on Monday, and I\u2019ll do a nursing course after that so I\u2019ve lost most of my high school friends and probably won\u2019t be making many at my new school where most of my classmates will be much older than me. I\u2019d really like some new friends because I\u2019ve been really lonely lately since I don\u2019t have many people to talk to and I\u2019m left home alone most of the time. Usually I\u2019m either playing video games, out playing Pokemon Go, messing around on my phone or spending time with my pets. I should mention I have a few different pets including a lizard named Gilbert and a python named Kyle. Reptiles are a huge obsession of mine, and so are crystals (I collect them!), watching YouTube, reading and writing (not as much as I used to), cooking, eating said cooking, binging Netflix, shopping, making jewellery and fishing if the weather is right. Video games are my favourite pastime and don\u2019t laugh but, I play Fortnite alot, and I\u2019m a competitive Mario Kart player. I\u2019d like to play my Switch and 3ds a little more since I sold my Xbox and don\u2019t use the ps4 often, so if you\u2019re a Nintendo gamer, I\u2019d love to get a message from you! For pc games, I\u2019m into Guild Wars 2 mostly and used to be addicted to Minecraft. If you\u2019ve managed to read this far, and if you\u2019d like to hopefully get together to play video games or even for a nice chat, feel free to message me and we can maybe play together! I don\u2019t care about gender (would like a few more friends who are girls that I can bond with as most of my friends are guys). Please don\u2019t be too much older than me and creepy. Oh yeah and one more thing, please pm me if you wanna talk and don\u2019t just write something in the comments to try and get me to pm you because I probably won\u2019t, sorry!

I don't have an issue with her having a SO when I don't and have invited them my house, made plans to spend time with him, etc but no matter what I do, she is irritated with me.  example.  we had a girls vacation planned and she invited him but didn't tell me until last minute.  they were both complete jerks to me and treated me like a third wheel.  During that time, she told me, don't make me choose between the two of you.  uh, i never asked you to.  I just ask that you treat me with respect vs telling me what to do when vs asking for my input; and include me in conversations vs whispering to each other non-stop while we are at dinner, etc.   I went and found other people to do things with. after several attempts to figure out a solution.  To this day, she blames the whole vacation weirdness on me.  Yet, after vacation, she says she wants to be friends.  ok, lets try again.  they come to my house and I have a good time.  I thought they did but the whole next week she avoids me, then when I stop at her house to pick something up that she asked me to get, she makes an off-hand remark that I am needy.  Does the same thing our next conversation.  omg, I have friends that I hang out with outside her friendship and no longer text her unless she texts me and I don't ask her to spend time together as she is always with SO and I do not make off hand comments or snide remarks about she has disappeared (although I know others do).  do I feel loss, yes, but who cares, that's how life goes, a single friend gets a SO, you see them less, some disappear, so I can step back.  yet, these snide remarks about my being needy.  I also know that she has no other friends either than me and had been referring to me as her best friend.  Today she said to me, ''my other best friend that has an SO...\".  \nI am at a loss on how to go forward.  my knee jerk is to say, f this.  she clearly cannot balance a friend and a relationship and she is making up problems in her head then projecting them onto me. I have tried to talk to her about it, but she makes it all about me and a psychological dissertation of what's wrong with me.  I am tired of this and  am thinking this is bs, I was filler and all those thoughts about my being her \"best friend\" and important and blah blah blah was really just during her filler period and in her eyes, now that she has a bf, I am worthless to her.  ...but before I say, i am done with this garbage, wondering if anyone has a different perspective on how to manage or adjust our friendship.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

My best friend of basically 3 years now got into a bit of a fight.\n\nI have met her while having a problem with a girl I was having a crush with and began talking alot since. We became friends instantly and with time and hanging out we became literally like family (she is like a sister I never had). We used to chat and meetup almost daily and talked about literally everything, from problems to relationship advice. We were so close that people thought we were dating.\n\nBut lately, I feel we have drifted apart. We talk less and less now and most of the times that I tell her to meet up she says that \"she can't\". I asked if I did anything wrong, and she always denies it but I am the only one that she treats like that. Plus in every argument she insists that I am wrong and she is right and \"You have not lived half of my experiences\". \n\nNow I am the type of person that looks in the details and the subtle small things and when I see something wrong I get furious (yes I need anger management classes) but I don't talk about it which makes her angry too even if I'm right. When I calm down, I excuse my behavior and explain my point but I get the usual answer from her \"You're wrong I'm right answer\".\n\nRecently I decided that I would talk to her about a problem I saw so we wouldn't fight. Guess I was \"wrong again\" and she denied that the problem was her and it was me. So she stopped talking to me when I texted which was unusual thing to happen after a fight with us. So I stopped for the day and texted her afterwards, still nothing. I decided that two can play this game. The day after she texted me and I didn't reply. Now we are in a \"status war\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Question is: Did I do something wrong here? Should I cut ties with her for good?\n\nOur friendship is a bit complex (I may have missed some points) and if you need anything I would be glad to answer.

I've met some great people on here and I hoped I can meet some more interesting people to become friends with. Don't worry about those I'm already talking with I will still talk with you. Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nI just recently graduated from college with a degree in film mostly focusing on editing. I suffer from both anxiety and depression. It effects me a lot on day to day basis mostly depression. Some days I'm fine Some I'm not. So if I complain about being depressed please understand I can't control it and at least be sympathetic towards it.\n\nI'm also somewhere on the spectrum. Its not as severe as other people probably. Like you wouldn't think i have It because I'm on the high functioning side of the spectrum. However my social skills are really bad which makes it difficult to make friends in real life. \n\nI'm a very shy, lonely and boring person. I have a hard time making conversation so I might be boring to talk to. I will try my best. I don't have much in my life but I just recently found an internship sort of. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Big Little Lies, The Handmaid's Tale, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03. If you going to message me I recommend you being around my age at least 18-26. Nobody younger or older to chat with cause I feel it would be awkward lol. I can make some exceptions. \n\nImportant, don't bother sending me a message if your just going to ghost. It really hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Also I  don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again. It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have a Kik, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now. Until we get to know each other more. I prefer the pm message box and not the chat but whatever works for you. So yeah just msg me your age, gender, and a little bit about yourself so I know you read all this lol.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

At first we became friends because I genuinely thought she was a cool person and we had a lot of fun partying together, but towards the end I bit my tongue on a lot of occasions and remained her \"friend\" because I had by then learned she was the type to get pissed the second I didn't do exactly what she wanted, when she wanted and run to my then boyfriend (her brother) and tell him all kinds of honestly trivial things that he would lose his mind over, just to get back at me. \n\nWhen her brother and I split up for good I made the hard decision to move out of state as a way to avoid falling for his shit for the thousandth time and taking him back. He would pull the typical \"I'm so sorry, it will never happen again\" line and my weak ass would always fall for it. I didn't tell her (or anyone else) I was leaving and she of course was pissed, but I didn't want anyone to have contact with me while I got my life together. \n\nI spent the next ten years growing up. I quit doing drugs and drinking. I got a good job. Met a great guy who I eventually married. I learned to skydive, learned to fly a plane, and traveled to some of the places I always wanted to go. Throughout all of this I still kept in touch with my friend sporadically, mostly to keep up with what was going on back home. \n\nChristmas of this past year I finally came home to visit and spent a few days at her house. During this visit I found out she was doing meth. We partied a lot in our younger years but meth was always the thing we swore we would never touch, so I was shocked. I will admit I tried it with her, but it just wasn't for me. I hate myself for giving in to her peer pressure and I don't have a good reason for why I did it. After spending more time with her than my actual family on my first trip home in nearly a decade and spending hundreds of dollars treating her kids to whatever they wanted while I was there, she ended up flipping out on me and saying I was a shit friend because I spent the last day I was there exclusively with my family. I woke up the day of my flight to awful text messages and voicemails. The worst part for me was when she said that I thought I was \"too good for her\" and that she talked about it with her 11 year old son and that he agreed. This is a kid who idolized me growing up and referred to me as his aunt. I didn't speak to her for months after that.\n\nFast forward to April of this year. She randomly called me out of the blue and in a moment of weakness I answered and confessed my husband and I were getting a divorce and I would be moving cross country back home. I just needed SOMEONE to talk to. The first thing out of her mouth was something along the lines of \"whatever you cant keep out of your house, give to me\". This was the final straw for me and I decided I was done. \n\nI moved back home sooner than expected and instead of even humoring the drama, I blocked her and all of her family/our mutual friends from my Facebook posts. I didn't realize I had forgotten her sons alternate account and she eventually saw all of my posts, and realized I was back. She went into a rage and sent me a message saying, \"how are you gonna block me from all your posts, what a cunt move\". \n\nI haven't entertained her messages and I have stood strong in my decision to ignore her and not fall back into her drama, but I can't help but have moments that I feel like I owed her an explanation, maybe not now but initially - am I wrong for the way I went about things?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I was just browsing this website and I came across the account of a friend that I used to have three months ago. I would say that we were pretty good friends. We started talking at least nearly a year ago, and we talked pretty much every day. Then, one day, I stated my feelings of affection toward this person, even though they quite clearly did not feel the same way. It was such a stupid thing to do and I'm kind of kicking myself right now. Our friendship gradually degraded until one day I said some really stupid and mean spirited stuff about this person. That pretty much ended our friendship completely. Ever since then, it's been bitter hatred between the two of us, with the both of us talking negatively about each other around other people. I was actually confident about my actions until just today. Like I said, I had found this user's account while browsing this website. I took a look at some of their other posts and had a kind of sudden realization that they were human just like me, that I was in the wrong this whole time. What made it even worse, though, was that I was listening to the Carrie and Lowell Live album by Sufjan Stevens at the time. The combination of the music and the realization really got me depressed.

I don't know why I chose that particular headliner in the first place--probably just to get your attention. In the moment, I thought it sounded edgy and humorously self-deprecating, but upon reading it over hours later, after a handful of message questioning my emotional state, it's pretty obviously not. I can't change the stupid title, but can edit the bio, so please forgive the cringy-ness and, instead, read this extended list of facts about me.\n\n1. I live in California, USA, but am Korean, and am admittedly proud of my West Coast upbringing comparative to, say, a cult-y communal village in the middle of Montana (think Midsommar vibes, North-western edition). Nothing wrong with Montana, or like, Iowa of course, but my friends and I joke that that\u2019s where serial killers go to dump the bodies of their victims. If you are actually from there though, sorry, and I would love to get to know a serial killer, so don\u2019t think I discriminate.\n2. My spirit animal on steroids is a 35 year old weeb who blows his disappointed Asian mother\u2019s savings on holographic anime girl prints, otome games, hentai porn, and an extensive magic girl cosplay outfit for AX2020. Some of my favorite animes are: Kill la Kill, Gurren Lagann, Code Geass, Fairy Tail, My Hero Academia, Castlevania, A Silent Voice, and Psycho Pass. Naruto is yet to be on this list, and probably never will be.\n3. I have an irrational, prejudiced hatred towards dubs, even when it\u2019s good, and insist on subtitles for absolutely everything, which extends past anime to French foreign films to Kdramas to Netflix original Italian shows.\n4. I don\u2019t play games, but I have a Discord, so when Discord says that it\u2019s a community for gamers, I am evidently a fraud. My last console was when I was like 10 and had a Nintendo DS Lite with pirated games that I loved so much that I wouldn\u2019t take 30 seconds out of gameplay to feed my fish. Thus, my mother took that as a cue not to further my addictive personality, and after my DS broke, I never saw a console again. My dreams of becoming a veteran e-girl with herpes-infected bath water merch were evidently crushed, and fast forward to 5 years later, I consider it an achievement to get 11th place on Mario Karts.\n5. I have a diverse taste in music, and am always open to any recommendations of any genre or language: pop, Kpop, Jpop, EDM, post-hardcore, rap, rap rock, hard rock, metal, fuck, even country--you name it. Some of my favorite artists (according to my Apple music \u201cFavorites\u201d playlist) are: Papa Roach (my favorite band), Rihanna, Travis Scott, Wagakki, Bring Me the Horizon, Sleeping with Sirens, Neovaii, and In This Moment.\n6.

The fuckin' ice-cream machine is broke, and you are shit outta luck. \n\n*DISCLAIMER: This post has been rated S, for \"Shit Humor\", viewer discretion is advised.*\n\n\nGreetings, delicious friends!\n\n\n\nI, too, am a real human who came here in search of other real humans in hopes of making lasting, real connections (with humans!).\n\n\n\nAbout me: I eat the daily requirement of lettuce, fried chicken and marzipan (the staples of human diet!) and sleep in the allotted for it hours (in my human bed!). I love inhaling the substance that is made of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 1% made up of argon, carbon dioxide and methane (if you breathe, you inspire. If you don\u2019t, you expire!)\n\n\n\nI do not believe in human gods. Instead, I praise the glorious Lord Cthulhu, the Flying Spaghetti Monster and Bob.\n\nPolitics are fairly important to me. For clarity, since humans like clarity, I am rather left on the (human!) political spectrum.\n\n\n\nI am almost 20 Earth years old (just two more weeks or so), and would strongly prefer to talk with humans who are 17+ Earth years old!  \n\n\n\nLike all other real humans, I like to feel emotions (since it is one of the things that make human a human!); particularly anger, sadness and despair. Those are the best, they fill me with so much joy! :D \n\nI speak English and Russian, and am planning on learning ASL! \n\n\n\nI also love deep discussions about human shit, slow walks along the beach on my one human leg (it even has a flipper! How convenient) and jokes - the more juvenile and insulting the better. Awful puns really butter my croissants, too. Stupid memes, too. Did you know that tHE sUn IS a DeADLY lAzEr?\n\n\n\n\nRight now, I am playing [Space Station 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URJ_qSXruW0) - the video game version of weaponized autism! If you are down to play it with me, you are my new favourite person. I would tell some tales of my adventures, but that would easily double the size of this post, so instead, you can watch the video to get an idea about this game. \n\nI've mostly been playing Silicon roles recently (AI and the Cyborg), as I find them to be much more relaxing and more reliant on social interactions as compared to game mechanics (like constantly announcing that the Penis Inspection Day is now in effect), or Atmospherics, because accidentally flooding the station with Plasma is fun. \nThinking about giving Virology a try, because hey! deadly viruses, what can possibly go wrong?\n\nAlso, Yakuza 0. It is a pretty fuckin\u2019 great game, even if the writing does require the suspension of disbelief from time to time. \n\n\nWhile I did not have a chance to read as much as I would like to recently, I rather like to do so. Some of my favourite books are the Neuromancer, 1Q84 and the Roadside Picnic.\n\n\n\nFor music, my tastes vary - while generally, my preferred genres are rock and metal (followed by techno / industrial / electronic), I listen to more or less anything other than modern pop and rap. I am up for trading some phat beatsies! \nRight now, I've been listening to a lot of 80-s style synth, much like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4drHKqrLgiw). Do watch the video! \n\n\n\nI also play airsoft! Spent way too much money on my kit, seeing as pretty much everything is real - including a fairly rare plate carrier with kevlar inserts. Can't wait to actually get some gaming in, now that the season is on again. \n\n\n\nI do have to point out that I am a bit of a grammar Nazi when it comes to human languages. Please ensure that your writing is within acceptable standards if you\u2019d like to converse. I also cannot stand small talk and generic, meaningless messages. \n\nI have Discord, but for the first while I\u2019d prefer Reddit PMs in order to get to know one another. That specifically means no Chats; I can\u2019t stand the UI, and the whole thing is bugged on iOS. \n\n\n\nIf you are one of the few people that got to here, mention something about... mm.. potatoes in your post. Or just hit me with a stupid joke. \n\nSince this appears to be an issue for some of you: I am en route to become a police officer. If you have a problem with that, this fish is probably not the right friend for ya!  However, intelligent conversation on the topic is welcome.  \n\n\n\nAdditionally, work as a security guard, and am currently pretty fuckin\u2019 tired. Yesterday, I was on shift 1400 to 0100 at a musical festival, which had Snoop Dogg. But hey, if you want stories about a  couple being ejected for \u201cpeeing as they walk\u201d or that time a guard mistook a comb for a flip-knife, well, I am your guy!\n\n\n\nHonestly, tell me a bit about yourself. I am not expecting a wall like this one - far from it, but if you just write couple generic sentences.. I ain\u2019t gonna reply.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, here is a picture of me (because humans like to look at pictures of humans they may want to talk with! \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/xj87hxT\n\n\n\n\n\n(As an FYI, I usually talk like a normal person. You won't have to put up with this 24/7. And yes, I realize that I've posted this a few times, which means that I am still looking for friends. Not too sure why some of you take it as a sign that it is OK to hinder my effort to *make friends* by chain-downvote me.. but hey, you do you \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_//\u00af).\n\n\n\n- A Real Human", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I volunteer at my local pool every summer to teach kids how to swim. Living in Boston has made me appreciate other sport a LOT more, especially after the Superbowl and the World Series win.\n\nI love pets but don't have any. I love watching Netflix. Shows like the Office, Friends, Doctor Who, Parks and Rec, True Crime shows, Black Mirror, Bojack Horseman and MANY many more. I used to watch anime but not so much recently. My friends are making me watch Miraculous Ladybug and as embarrassed as I am, it really makes me laugh. I love late night talks. Some bands/artists I like are the Beatles, Lauv, Alessia Cara, Post Malone, Billie Eilish and again a lot more. Some songs I'm listening to while writing this... \"I'm so tired...\" and \"if we never met\".\n\nI play a lot of video games, mostly on PC (If you want, I can show you my steam). I'm trying to learn the Ukulele (would love if someone could give me any tips) and due to hiccups in life, I've been working really hard on improving myself and my personal relationships. I would love to talk about deep life stuff if you would like to too, but we can also just have a fun time, goof off and laugh.\n\nI would really like friends who are open, honest and kind. I pride myself on being a good listener and I have a LOT of stories to tell. I don't really care about age or gender. I just want... good friends i guess haha.\n\nI have used this subreddit in the past but a lot of the friends I've made have come and go. I want some friends who can stand the test of time. Tbh it doesn't really matter if our interests don't line up exactly. I think learning/talking about new things or just life experiences can be fun! I would really like to make a discord server, not with a lot of people but a few really tight nit group who might want to watch shows together, listen to music or make memes/jokes together.

He was talking like he would normally texting etc then when one of us sent a text he started to ignore. Gave it a few weeks sent some more messages about this and that no answer. Then my friend messaged him and he eventually answered her with \"how did you get my number?\" he knew she had his number it's not like he's never met her. I found that quite arrogant and I thought he was being obnoxious and we are all in our 20s. So I gave it a few more weeks I rang him and he answered the phone and I asked if we were even still friends and he was like \"yeah I'm still your friend I'm just busy\" by the tone of his voice I could tell he didn't want to be my friend anymore he said he would ring back as he claimed he was busy when he clearly wasn't as I could here him with his sister and other friends laughing in the background. He's never too busy to reply to anyone and if he is he would always get back to you. Then I just had enough and said its obviously he's ignoring me and everyone else and just said have a nice life.\n\nThen I had a friend who I was friends with for a while, I met my partner through him years ago. We were chatting on Facebook then he eventually stopped replying. Then he started to blank me around town after trying to say hello, I also saw him at the train station with his friend or boyfriend. This was around 5 years ago. So I hadn't attempted to contact him 5 years since, when I went back on Facebook last year he decided to automatically block me without me even attempting to message him or anything. When I had to make another he blocked that too. Now after 5 years I don't even know why he would have such a complex towards me and I know full well I hadn't done anything wrong but he seemed to specifically block me not anyone else he doesn't speak to but he did remove my partner more recently. When I did message him to confront him I said he is petty blocking me for no reason without me even contacting him, that was the only message in 5 years. I tried to ask him how he was explained my ups and downs, jobs etc told him about losing a pregnancy and this and that. To which he responsed \"please stop messaging me I have absolutely no interested in speaking to you your partner or anyone else from school\" he didn't have any sympathy or wasn't happy for me over the good things I've achieved since we last spoke. He didn't even meet my partner at school for a start and we had talked years after we left school. If he has no interested in speaking to other people why does he not block them and why does he apparently always say hello to them in the street and yet seems to have this issue with me? It seems he thinks he's above a lot of people these days and for his age there are more polite approaches to end friendships and drift apart. I will just take it is he must really really not like me and to be honest I probably wouldn't care if I heard he died tommorow if he has no emotion towards anything in my life. I've seen his posts and he just appears to show off. Also in the message I joked \"so if I were to buy some glasses in the optician you work would you refuse to serve me lol\" luckily I don't get my glasses at that one anyway.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this and how did you manage to not let it get to you? Any tips for if I end up seeing him around? I know the best thing to do is just walk past like you would a stranger but I mean how to not let it mentally get to you? I know this can happen to anyone at any age.\n\nI like to make myself better about why I wouldn't want to be his friend these days anyway. I think about all the vile things he did in the past one of which was a rumor I'd killed myself when I wasn't at school for a bit that the whole year group laughed about.

If people around me are miserable, I feel miserable. If they're happy and excited about life, same thing.\n\nI was lucky to grow up with friends that always looked into life in a optimistic yet still realistic way. They made me want to do better for myself. They are patient and supportive. They also don't fall on the bullshit of saying what I want to hear. They tell me what I need to hear. This helped me not fall into lame and one-sided relationships and behaviour that wouldn't help me grow and evolve as a person.\n\nBut in the last year and a half I got close to another girl and we're now friends. And I swear, although she was a huge support for me after heartbreak, some of her specific behaviour and actions bother me a lot. At his point, it's the only thing in my life I'd like to fix if I could.\n\nShe's smart but I always see her falling into patterns of giving people more than they give her back. Based on past stories she shared with me and what I've seen, she believes in \"not giving up on people\" and that has put her in unfulfilling relationships and dating situations. People ghost her and she keeps trying to get them into her life. She was stuck in an on-and-off relationship for over a decade with the same guy, who clearly didn't respect her.\n\nI see all of this as a waste of energy. The ones who care don't need to be \"reminded\" to stick around. Because I never saw such behaviour being executed and accepted by my closest friends, this all seems weird and unnecessary to me.\n\nAm I exaggerating? Can someone please help me be more understanding towards her? I've told her that if she falls into the same patterns, she'll get the same results but she says that she's strong and confident enough.

Let me know your honest thoughts", "author": "GoddessSandra", "self_text": "I recently had a friend tell me over text that she felt uncomfortable around me  and wanted to end the friendship. It was a weird move as we hadn't been friends for long (three months at most) and usually when I end friendships that were short-lived, I  distance myself until they drift outside my life. So I asked if I had said or done something and she assured me that it wasn't specific but was not comfortable sharing the reason, adding that she thought we were different people and that nothing she said would have changed anything (which is fair, except she never raised concerns or even tried to solve the problem).  \n\n\nJust some background, this girl was someone I met at work. We both connected due to being interested in academics and various intellectual discussions. In retrospect, there were two red flags that came up. One red flag was that she immediately opened up to me about EVERYTHING - some very personal (like her health, past family troubles, mental illness). The second was that she complained a lot about people being racist, immature or narcissists ( I didn't know the people in her life but I thought she just happened to bump into shitty people). Nonetheless, she was always very nice and sweet to everyone, seemed sensitive to how people were feeling- almost to the point of absorbing their emotions. While I am also highly empathetic, I can shut it off pretty easily. This is where we differ because I am more capable of saying harsh but helpful truths even if someone doesn't like it. However, I always held back on her because I knew that she wouldn't be able to handle it. And TRUST ME when I say there was a LOT I held back on. For instance, she often humblebragged about being victimised for her beauty or intelligence or race. This girl wasn't ugly, but she wasn't a great beauty by conventional standards. In most of the stories, it sounded like something else less palatable caused her to be persecuted (like accidentally pissing someone off, or being bullied for being a nerd rather than a great beauty).  These stories were often told in response to my own stories with mildly annoying people that were told in a humorous way. Most people I know would just laugh, knowing I wasn't actually emotionally affected by it and didn't really hate them. But she would take it VERY SERIOUSLY and talk about how HORRIBLE the people were.   \n\n\nAnother weird thing was that she talked a LOT about her health problems in scientific terms. She did have some serious issues but the way she talked implied that she obsessively researched about them. Despite claiming she didn't want sympathy, she brought it up even when i wasn't asking. I tried to offer my support but she always refused. Before she cut things off, we were both busy and taking our time to respond. Nonetheless, the week before, she was still sharing her health problems, looking very uncomfortable while doing so. I thought she was just feeling sick and ignored it but maybe she didn't want to tell me. It was strange because I never asked and wasn't forcing her.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019m not 100% but I think I may have reason to believe my friend is cheating on her bf, or at the minimum actively using dating sites.\n\n Some basic back story my friend and I are both graduate students. We met in grad school and became pretty solid friends. That said because we\u2019ve become decently close friends we do talk about personal stuff. Including stuff like our dating life and related topics. This is where things get a tad tricky.\n\nEssentially her and I had a bit of a fight about a week ago, and we ended up making up. In total honesty, I ended up just taking a knee and letting her off the hook on stuff because she was having a rough week (this comes into play). Kind of to note is that while mention of her boyfriend came up, I can\u2019t say we ever really went into the topic (nothing like, oh hey how are you and x doing). \n\nI had been speaking to one of my friends from outside the school about the argument, so he was vaguely familiar with some basic stuff about her. Then yesterday night he randomly texted me saying that he though he matched with her on Hinge. I kind if laughed it off, until he sent me a screenshot showing that he indeed did match with her and it was indeed yesterday. \n\nI feel really mixed up on the situation because on one hand I clearly don\u2019t know the full story but on the other hand, at least from my side everything comes off poorly. I don\u2019t know if maybe that the issues earlier in the week were with her bf, but at the same time we\u2019re close friends and when vague mention of the bf came up in our talk it seemed positive and gave no hint of issues. I don\u2019t know if maybe he\u2019s okay with her being on dating apps, which if it\u2019s an understood thing I guess is understandable, but just the way she has spoken of their relationship I feel it\u2019s unlikely. (plus to my understanding she hadn\u2019t touched her dating profiles in weeks)\n\nSo I guess what I\u2019m getting at is, on one hand maybe there\u2019s more to the story than what I\u2019m seeing and maybe I should ask, but on the other hand it\u2019s really easy for her to simply write me off or say its not my business. But seeing as she\u2019s my good friend I would honestly be really uncomfortable if some sketchy stuff is going down, I would maybe want to tell her bf, and truth be told based on some past incidents I would feel she\u2019s being incredibly hypocritical. \n\nI don\u2019t necessarily want to dive too deep into the hypocritical thing, but based on past events she kind of seems like she\u2019s really good at justifying doing whatever she wants and acts as if she\u2019s always in the right and it can be downright juvenile. I\u2019ve vaguely approached her in the past, but as I\u2019ve said she\u2019s good at dodging things. So I guess I don\u2019t know what I should do here. Should I directly ask her about her bf, should I tell her my friend matched her, should I ask my friend if she\u2019s straightforward about having a bf, or what?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019m married, working multiple jobs, and going to grad school. I figure we are all adults (late 20s) so it\u2019s understandable. \n\nI have had a friend who always hated on another one of my friends. Then I had some serious drama go down and my friend was there for me that week and asserted herself as my best and closest friend. I don\u2019t really consider people best friends vs not anymore. I just consider my friends and my husbands (no tiered labels). \n\nAnyway, she got engaged and asked me to be her MOH and only bridesmaid. A year later I got engaged. She and I planned our weddings close to each other. I felt obligated to have her be my MOH so she was. Honestly it was terrible. Her demands and expectations were crazy and it was just awful. \n\nI invited her to our home for a friend game night after not hearing from her for a month and then she came, complained about the food and the games and made everyone uncomfortable. And then she never texted after that day. It\u2019s been 5 months. She randomly sent my husband some wedding photos in a text. Nothing else. And no message with the photos. \n\nI texted recently and nothing...\n\nI don\u2019t want to be friends at this point but I\u2019m also angry.

When we were in college, we saw each other everyday, if not, every other day, our friendship was pretty good and she was the type of friend that I thought I could grow old with. As we grew older, I have gained a lot of personal growth and have become better version of myself, wiser, more interesting, have hobbies, always try to step out of my comfort zone, (doesnt matter if its an event, a hobby, a job),  enjoy various local events and activities, living my best life, and many more. I have become more experienced and mature in job, friendships, relationships...etc. \n\nShe has always said that she admires me being adventurous and is really an active participant of life, because she is the exact opposite and we are becoming a lot different each year, especially after we graduated. She has become more boring and boring each year, and dull, it could also be that I have become a lot more interesting and fun, while she still remains the same, she only enjoys going to the mall (not buying anything) and staying home (sleeping and being on the internet/phone). These are her two \"hobbies\". I drift apart from her emotionally gradually and now its get to a point where I dont want to meet up because it bores me to death.   \n\n\nAfter graduation, we probably hang out 6 times per year, and every time she wants to go shopping, not because she wants to buy anything, because she enjoys wander around different malls mindlessly. For the past year, I was blunt to her, I told her I disliked shopping because every time we hung out it was the same. And then she accepted it and she suggested going to somewhere downtown even another city, a few times, just to canceled last minute. I think she got cold feet because shopping was her comfort zone, and doing something different was not. \n\n  \nShe's been stuck in a boring job (quote by her) since her graduation, always says she wants to get a new one, but its been 4 years, she is financially stable since she is able to afford expensive trip, we are both in our late twenties and she still hasn't been in any relationship or done anything with any male, which is fine but and she doesnt have any other friend or activities that she enjoys, the only thing she enjoys is going to the mall. Just the other day she told me herself that she is a very boring person. I said why dont you change that by going to some events downtown and ill come with you if you want. She didn't respond to that.\n\nShe hasn't been in any relationship or done anything with any guy before so its hard to talk about guys with her, like we can't even share some romantic experiences or stories. She isn't bad looking btw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n\nI am happy with my current job, my life in general, because I have been willing to try different things, finding what I like and what I dont, and take the risks to try different options when things dont work out. While she has always been unhappy yet unwilling to change whatever situation she is in even though she always has choices. We were both in the same major in college and its quite clear to see how different our lives have become and she knows that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are just in very different stages in life and I am always unhappy when I hang out with her because she is too boring, yet I dont want to hurt her because she hasn't done anything terribly wrong.  She is alwaYs the one to ask me to hang for the past year, so im running out of excuses to say no. I have been cut out by a friend many years ago because she thought we weren't a good match, I remembered how hurt I was back then. So I dont want to do the same to her.

I've decided to join this subreddit to fix that 'lack of' friends that I have as I don't really have any real proper close friends unlike them neither do I have any real life friends, I had tried in the past, going to meetups, meeting people in pubs/bars but it never worked out because I either had too high expectations only to be let down or just had bad experiences with people due to meeting people in the wrong places.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nABOUT ME:\n\nI'm from UK, I'm 20 years old I'm a content creator that specialises in making Vaporwave animations, I also do voice-acting for most of the characters that I animate also.

If you like vaporwave, 80s music, animation, sci-fi horror movies, like to discuss life's biggest questions, anything music related particularly singing if that's your interest then you'll probably enjoy my company. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nI'm a little socially inept, very introverted though that does not mean I always enjoy being alone. I like to socialise when I am able to.  Sometimes I do have trouble reading and understanding certain social cues, and may be a little too straightforward, but I don't mean to be rude as it's not my intention. My intention is to have a great time, meet people and if a friendship happens then good, if not then no big deal. The more things we have in-common, the more we have things to talk about.

From now on she\u2019ll be called F, for friend.. F had a boyfriend who was a drug dealer, and he also hated me. He will be called AB for asshole boyfriend. \n\nSo some time ago, I talked to F daily. Good morning texts, goodnight texts and everything in between. We all went to the same school so we would always hangout in addition to our online conversations. One day during the school day I had been bored sitting in class, when I had realized I didn\u2019t get a text from F. Naturally, I texted her to find out.. I had been blocked. So I went to another platform to text her and found I had also been blocked there. F had blocked me on every. Single. Platform. And I\u2019m not sure why because the night before everything seemed normal. I went to talk to her in the halls to find her boyfriend borderline holding her from talking to me. A week after this she continued to have me blocked but had also started pretending I don\u2019t exist.\n\nPost:\n\nFast forward a year and she finally unblocks me because she broke up with AB for reasons I had told her about before she blocked me a year earlier. \n\nDuring the time she spent ignoring and blocking me, I tried to move on but almost never did. When I had major accomplishments in our football league and started new things and even new relationships she wasn\u2019t there for me to talk to which hurt. \n\nShe tried to act like nothing had happened which I don\u2019t know what to take from that but it wasn\u2019t a good feeling. She has apologized but I just doesn\u2019t feel like a apology can justify her actions\n\nPost:\n\nSo I guess what I\u2019m asking is how do I get over this?

I'm starting to think he also has period like women. For one week, he's insufferable little shit. He can literally argue about anything.

I'm crying, I'm lost what to do. I like him, I know he's a good guy, but whenever I try to talk with him about this, he dissmises it or ignores me.

We kept sending each other letters and presents during Christmas and meeting regularly and everything went well. Well, until she got to University and she became more self centred than ever. Last summer I used all my birthday money from my family and my own earned money from work to pay her a trip to my now country of residence,England, including tours, museums, hotels etc. I did everything I could to accommodate her, from going wherever she wanted to cancelling plans with friends to make time for her and getting time off work. this was not reciprocated. I spent some time in our country of origin with her and she acted as if I was not even there. We went to a festival where she spent more time with her other friends(who btw were not in our initial plan and I was told they were just\"hanging around with us for a bit\") and ignored me and only did something about this when I got upset, did her volunteering work on her laptop when we were supposed to spend time together, rejected my offer to pay for cabs rather than taking the bus because I wanted to fully enjoy my holiday and be comfortable rather than be restricted by the bus times. Regarding the work, I understood that she had work to do but on the other hand that was not a company she was working for and she should have been allowed to have a few days off. Anyway I thought things would change once she got to England. Oh boy I was wrong. She spoke on Skype with her volunteering friends on set times and we had to get home so she could talk to them. I once listened to what they were talking about and instead of discussing issues like events or important stuff they were just joking around. My blood was boiling at the time especially because I asked her nicely to request them to send her emails with everything she has to do while she is away so that we can go out and spend time together. She insisted that she has to take part in these Skype sessions so I did not say anything. The holiday left me with so many questions that I wanted to address but I chose not to because I did not want to ruin our friendship or make her think that I only wanted things done my way. However, this summer we met again and the same things happened. She was involved with her friends again, with work, completely careless about a concert that I was dreaming of since I was 13, and again the damn cab thing(I offered to pay for one because she was freezing while waiting for the bus- I wasn't because I am used to the weather in the UK now so I don't get cold that easily but I wanted to do that for her. )She expected ME to go to her place at Uni and wait for her to finish work in order to meet and did not even consider than I have other friends or family I may want to see in my country of origin. There are so many other things that I don't have the length to discuss about but they left me heartbroken. She is so self involed and absorbed and I would love to talk to her about these things but I am afraid she would not take them well and our friendship will be over. On a level we have a deep connection and always have fun, but other than that I don't think our personalities match anymore.. I am a comfortable person who wants to please others and she is a person who only sees her own interests and does not care about comfort. What should I do? How should I approach the situation? Is it worth it?\n\nTL;DR: friend only does things her own way, two experiences are described", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I also don't know how to start a relationship as I found myself intruding or bordering when I'm talking to someone, I don't know if they want to be with me so I asumw they don't.\n\nFor this and other reasons I had a lot of free time ( apart from work and studies) so I have a lot of hobbies, I have knowledge on the following matters, from more to less (approximately): Photography and videography, DIY, making, 3D desing, 3D printing, quadcopters (drones), electronics, computers, reading, videogames, art (not that I paint but I study it in all it's forms), podcasting and narration. This list was not to brag as I find myself not competent enough in any of this matters but to find common themes to talk about, I also spend a lot of time learning and watching youtube.\n\nHonestly I don't know what to expect with this. I recently learned that I have a hard time asning for help so this may be a cry for help. Here is 3:44 AM so I probably need to sleep, that may be the cause for me not responding.\n\nAnd If you have read until here, I have to give you the deepest thank you I can. You may notice I like to talk, maybe other explanation on why I don't have friends. Who knows.\n\nAnd thanks to reddit for having wholesome and awesome comunities like this, I've been lurking here for a long time and saw a lot of beatufill histories, is just admirable.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We got into an argument because he was upset over me being too short-tempered, so I confessed that I've been dealing with anger issues for a year now and depression for 3.  I've struggled with suicide, and until recently nothing had made me feel genuinely happy or proud of myself.  I felt for so long that I was a terrible person and my anger issues towards others stemmed from that.

He was the first and only person I've ever told, because I was afraid to talk about it.  He understood and said he was open to talk at any time.  He then told me that he hasn't been honest with me either, and then came out as bi.  Now, I have no problem with that I want that to be very clear.

Of course, I should have said NO, but I tried numerous times and overwhelmed my inexperienced teenage self with his pushiness. \n\nI ignored him for two years after he had been pushy AGAIN about some matter. It wasn't even the angry kind of ignoring that people do. I genuinely did not have the energy to deal with him, even though I did genuinely want to reach out to him again some time. He just keeps trying to decide what others should do. He contacted me on another phone number-based instant messaging platform. He had found himself another impossible and unhealthy relationship, which he necessarily had to talk to me about while I had a busy day ahead of me. I had to prepare a speech and had an important appointment right when he started talking to me. \n\nAnyway, I don't want it to seem like he's all bad. It's not like I'm a perfect person. He's actually the most kind-hearted, caring individual you'll ever meet. He can tell you about the most interesting things. Just too extraverted, I guess. And unaware of people's obvious dislike of his reaching out to them constantly. I know he doesn't mean to annoy anyone, but that's exactly what he does. He's in his thirties and I'm nearing 30. I feel like we're both too old for this shit. \n\nHave you guys ever dealt with such a friend, and if so, what did you do?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Once high school was over we drifted between friends and best friends as our lives changed and things happened. I went to uni, she got a bf. I met my partner and moved away, she got married and is now separated because she cheated.\n\nWe used to get along because of music tastes, and just generally had a laugh- high school sort of friendship. Now that I'm older I just see all the things I disagree and dislike about who she is and I don't want to continue the friendship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- She over talks me and doesn't offer any input on my conversations, unless it's to turn it into something about her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- She outed me as bisexual, and kinky in front of a bunch of old friends from high school that we had met up to catch up after 3 years. Told them how disgustingly kinky I was and all the stuff I was into, and showed them my profile on it. When I asked her she said, \"well your profile is out there I didn't think you were hiding it\". I have no face photos, no name. She only knows about it because when I first started on there making friends she wanted to know why I was on my phone. As a naive 18 year old best friend I told her. She didn't talk to me about my profile, I didn't know she was still searching my name and was keeping track of the groups I was in so she could find me when I changed my name.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Drives with me in the car- texts, drives irrationally. This I've asked her to stop and has told her i'm uncomfortable- then as we are driving she pulls out her phone (illegal in the UK). I feel unsafe and my partner does not want me in the car with her anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Recently (she was just separated) came to visit and basically wanted a rebound. She got wasted and then expected me to be her wingman. She is overweight (I am too but carry it well and with confidence) and was dressed slutty and was throwing herself at people, trying to show off her cleavage and shouting really loud to draw attention. I was just trying to enjoy my buzz and made friends with guys in the bar (rock bar- my kinda thing) we got to talking and she just threw herself at them. Then started an argument with me that I was flirting with them when they should be flirting with her (we were discussing xbox games rather than being rude and sitting there on my phone, not flirting in any way) One guy she was leering over was taken, so she focussed on the other guy. They weren't really hitting it off conversation wise but were both dtf so that was that. Both I and the other guy both advised our friends we weren't really comfortable with it and wanted to head back. My friend went nuts and ran and dragged us off, shouting and laughing how awful it was that I couldn't pull ( I have a partner of 6 years, I wasn't looking to pull!) and we ended up walking 2 miles at 3 am to their hotel. The taken guy was a gentleman and we spoke about films and rubbish all the way to the hotel, but he could have been dangerous. We didn't know these people and I didn't know the area well. The more I think about this the more I realise my friend didn't care for my safety, she was just interested in getting laid. She then demanded I get an uber for us both and to stop making things awkward by being a third wheel (I had steered clear and only checked in when I felt necessary- I wanted out of the situation, not in) She doesn't remember starting arguments, and spent the following morning obsessing over the guy, adding them on fb ( I messaged the guy to say thanks for not leaving me alone and hope they have a safe journey home. Safe to say when I got home and explained this all to my partner, he was livid. The more I think about it the more it makes me angry. Angry at her and angry at myself for not putting my foot down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Cheated on her partner 3 times, then cried it was because she was unloved and that she only did it due to the lack of attention from her partner. I've cheated once and it is the biggest regret I have. I spent so long acknowledging the mistake and trying to move on from it. It's a horrible feeling but it wasn't a one off mistake for her. The fact she cheated so much and \"cries poor little me\"makes me so angry. She did not care about her husbands feelings, only her own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce she was found out and they separated, she ran to a social networking site I use, and have many close and good friends in real life on there. There is no mistaking there can be potentially dangerous people and people using it to hook up, but she jumped on and made a profile, obsessed with the amount of guys (sorry- not both genders in this example it's just been guys) saying how hot she is and how they want to f\\*\\*k her. This is not uncommon, people will comment on your page calling you hot without having a profile photo. She's met 4 guys for casual sex so far, ignoring my warnings and all the while crying that the failure of her marriage was her husbands fault. Just to make it clear- i'm not mad about the casual sex- it's the \"I want a meaningful relationship with someone who only wants me\", whilst shacking up with several guys, desperate for attention to fulfil her (which never will because she dislikes herself).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Present day she is now living with a guy she met 2 months ago, and has said she doesn't care about anyones opinions on it. She said it's love and that she's besotted with him and thinks it is true love. I also found her profile back up on the networking site 2 days ago searching for guys and \"new friends\" on the casual encounters groups. So many lies, and when it blows up in her face she will run to me and expect me to side with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just can't do it anymore, she is a toxic person and I am trying to slowly detach from the friendship, but she is coming down in August with her new bf and wants me and my partner to meet him. My partner hates her but is polite for my sake. I am dreading it. It's the last bank holiday of the year, we wanted to enjoy it but instead she booked a hotel before I confirmed we could meet ( i said should be fine but will need to check with SO), then sent me a hotel booking screenshot with several messages being like \"You can't let me down, I've spent all this money for us to see you\". I know I could straight up refuse this but I think it might be a good way to discuss these issues and then part ways as she has to go back home for work the day after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not a brash or confrontational person. She is someone that knows my insecurities and has played with them for years. She will know how to cut me down but I need to get out. The idea of her being a big presence in my life is awful to me. She's jealous of my friends, the fact I moved away, that I like my job to an extent and that I still have a partner. I can't have that negativity in my life, I've battled with anxiety and depression for too long to finally feel better and have her ruin it.\n\nFor those who have cut toxic people out of your lives, how did you do it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I need to cut a toxic friend out of my life, but i hate confrontation.

We are both female. At the time we had been with our male partners for 3 years, she was also engaged and never was the type to hook up with guys or girls like that even when she was single.\n\nA month before, however, she did yell at me the whole night for talking to a single male coworker of hers at a party. I just thought she was too drunk and hormonal and brushed it off. She did apologise the next day.\n\nEverything goes on as normal for about 6 months until we start planning our vacation around the US with our partners and 4 other friends for June 2017. My partner's birthday was occurring during the trip and she refused to pick a house that would cause the four of us to share a room. This annoyed me because it didn't mean we were going to have sex. However we ended up sharing a room before his birthday in LA and everything was fine.\n\nHalfway into the trip my partner and I got engaged and she wasn't too excited and even had attitude with the waitress at dinner. A few days later at a club in Miami she looked around to see if our other girlfriends were in ear shot before grabbing me from behind (also not normal clubbing behaviour for her) and then moved to my front. My anxiety was running high so I turned away.\n\nA week later in an RnB bar in Memphis, my now fianc\u00e9e and I are dancing. She comes up to me and says \"Stop doing that\". I say \"Why? I like it\". She says \"But I don't like watching it\". She kicks me a few times in the back of the leg.\n\nIn the months after the trip things got surprisingly better. She was talking to me more than ever before over all social media (she lives about 17 hours away for work). Lots of compliments, support for my fitness lifestyle and general terms of endearment.\n\nThen around Xmas time 2017 it all stopped all of a sudden and has never been the same since. She only talks to me in our group chat. She comes home every 2-3 months and only likes to spend time with me with others. No compliments, no support, no lasting conversations. We're still close friends on the surface but if you dig a little deeper things are ugly between us. She is getting married in 3 months. I am not a bridesmaid as expected.\n\nI might be dramatic, but this has caused me a lot of frustration and guilt about what I have done or didn't do and how I really want to know what's going on without tearing us more apart.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I have been friends with them since primary school but I have always felt like apart of them don't really care about me you know? Like I feel like the \"least important in the friend group and it wouldn't matter whether you're there or not\".\nI actually walk with one of them to school everyday but it's awkward because I always have to start the conversation and if I don't (which I decided to try out a few times) then the whole walk to school would be dead silence. Not a single word my friend would say. And here's the other thing, I live literally two minutes away from her and we never hang out outside of school. I used to ask but now I stopped because I know she doesn't care. Whenever I asked she would say she's \"busy\" or she'd sigh. She hangs out with her other friends who live like five to ten minutes away but with me I live literally around the corner and not once has she asked if she wanted to hang or not. Look I get she can be busy but how come she's not busy when it comes to her other friends? And whenever my other friend does not come to school it's so awkward hanging out with her because I always have to start a conversation or she just goes on her phone and says nothing. She is more talkative to other people. Now I started to think am I \"rude?\" too \"pushy?\" so I talked less and tried to be more nice which I am already. Did it work? Nope. I know she doesn't want me around... Few days ago a girl who I am friends with but not that close asked if me and my best friend were available and I said yes. She never got back to me about the plans. Later found out they were hanging out with out me. Funny how she can make plans literally with everyone but not me. Makes me quite miserable because I feel lonely being couped up in my house all day and seeing people post pictures of them hanging out together.\nNow about my other friend. She's the same. Always busy when I ask if she wants to hang but never busy for her other friends. Few months ago a girl I used to be friends with were throwing my friend a party but apparently she was busy because her mum wanted to go to the movies. Turns out that movie wasn't even on that day. Either she's a terrible liar or just can't say no to her mum. Even though her mum was fine with the party so? Maybe she didn't want a party? But since the start of high school she'd be going on about how she wanted one so I don't understand. She always texts me so why doesn't she want to hang?\nAnyway I know this alot of writing and if I sound obbessive well trust me I am not... I just don't understand why my two friends who I hang with every day never and I mean never have asked to hang out with me outside of school. What happens when I graduate? If we can't make plans now then do they even want to keep in contact after high school?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

{"post_id": "cfzvgy", "created_utc": 1563721138, "title": "Am I right to think that I deserve an apology?", "author": "GamerTigrr", "self_text": "I (16/F) got into an argument with my friend not long ago. It was in a group chat, so four other people took part in/witnessed the argument (we\u2019re all the same age). One didn\u2019t participate and only read after, one was neutral, and the two others were on my side. It\u2019s all very complicated but I\u2019ll try to be brief and too the point. The main issue was that he was invited to a party which took place in park for the first part and later they went to a friends house. Only he had been invited out of our group, which is normal because we weren\u2019t really familiar with the people organizing the party. However, we had all expressed that we wanted to get to know these people because they look very nice and we had texted them in an another group chat before. He had a head start on us because he has a close friend that is part of said group. What really ticked off and hurt my friends and I is that before and after the party he was rly showing off about being invited and he also said that the party wasn\u2019t our type, because we\u2019re into more \u00ab\u00a0relaxed\u00a0\u00bb stuff. It is true that we never had the opportunity to go to a more \u00ab\u00a0intense\u00a0\u00bb party (drugs, strangers, public place, etc) but we were all very willing to try. He said the party had been really intense (cops got involved at some point), and that we would have been uncomfortable because we never experienced it. To me this is a fallacious argument because he had never experienced it either, and he said afterwards that he would go back. \n\nAnyhow, my friends and I expressed that we had been hurt by the fact that he didn\u2019t want to invite us. He argued that he genuinely didn\u2019t mean to hurt us, and that he doesn\u2019t see how the statement that \u00ab\u00a0it\u2019s not our environment\u00a0\u00bb can be hurtful. Eventually, for various reasons, he apologized to both of my friends (one because she DID have other friends at the party so she would\u2019ve been comfortable and the other because she was tired of arguing and apologized for overreacting, so he apologized back) but not to me. I had been more insistant because this isn\u2019t the first time he makes me feel excluded and i always keep it to myself because i don\u2019t want to cause trouble. It\u2019s very hurtful to me that he thinks I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle a party, and that he doesn\u2019t want my company at one. \n\nThis is where it gets weird and emotionally immature to me. He refused to apologize to me because he says that his comments weren\u2019t hurtful, and that he gave me his arguments. I don\u2019t agree with this though, because even if he didn\u2019t mean it, the fact remains that I AM hurt, and that\u2019s not something you can debunk with arguments. If I hurt a friend, apologizing would be the first thing I do, even if it wasn\u2019t intentional, and then maybe I would explain myself but I would still apologize. My other friends who have witnessed the argument all agree that he should apologize, except the neutral girl, I haven\u2019t asked her the question. \n\nTL;DR a friend hurt me and he doesn\u2019t want to apologize because he doesn\u2019t believe he was hurtful to me. I want an apology because the fact is that he hurt me whether he meant it or not. Other friends who were involved in the argument agree with me. \n\nSo is it normal that he doesn\u2019t want to apologize? Do I deserve an apology?\n \n\nI guess there is one more point I\u2019d like to specify:\n\nApparently we couldn\u2019t have went to the party anyways because it\u2019s a closed event (even though it was in a public place?) and my friend could only have brought one friend (the neutral girl) and  I totally respect that, I know I can\u2019t force invite myself. What\u2019s really hurting me is  that he was assuming we wouldn\u2019t be comfortable and that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t want to invite us.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

She has never had friends before outside of her family/husband/work friends. We met through work a few years ago and hit it off. She's an incredibly sweet and generous friend who would love nothing more than to just hang out at any point. My sister and I are her only friends and her best friends. \n\nSo the issue is, sister and I share another best friend (B) who we're considerably closer to than A. This is due to B living with us after her abusive family drove her out, and the fact that she's closer in age and shares more worldviews with us. We still treasure A, she's wonderful. But she's never been through normal young teenage friend drama that teaches boundaries/what are reasonable expectations for friends. When she had a really hard year with an cruel petty boss last year she became really insecure/obsessive. She found out that, despite Sis and I having seen the same movie with her the week before AND spending that afternoon with her, that we saw the same movie again with B and she got very teary/left out/felt like we should have invited her. B and A have interacted before okay but B admits she's worried that A will get jealous of her being around so they rarely cross paths. They are not friends but not like enemies either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told A last year that her getting upset at us spending time with B was upsetting us and making us feel like shitty friends for something that was normal. She kind of backed off and apologized. She has been much better this year and seems happier in general. Sometimes she's immature (gets snippy on Facebook to other people, etc) but some of that she says is due to her ADHD. (I'm sorry I don't know what it's like to have ADHD so I'm not sure, this is just what she's said to me). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSis, B, and I are going on a weekend trip next month to a rather small convention to enjoy ourselves/see some online buddies, etc. This isn't anything A is really a part of but I'm sure she'd say she wanted to go even though she has some personal huge trips of her own coming up this year.  I'm nervous to tell A that we're going. I considered not telling her at all but I'm thinking not telling her and her finding out afterwards would be even worse then just telling her up front. But I'm anxious about her having another crying meltdown. She has been better but I'll admit I'm sensitive to jealous friends due to some toxic friendships when I was younger. I would think she should be mature about it but like I said it's like she's learning friendship boundaries for the first time. I'm pretty desperate for help. I can answer any questions.

Time goes on and now of course still being babysat on every date because even after having sex I guess I'm still a guy with \"bad intentions\" by now it's been about 6ish months  of us dating, one day when I got off work at 6 p.m she wanted me to come over and visit because she missed me :) with it being 15 degrees outside with a -10 degree wind chill it was to cold for us to sit on the porch and I didnt want to get yelled at for her sitting in my vehicle plus my heater barely worked, after waiting outside for close to an hour I was freezing my ass off and I wasn't about to leave without even saying hi so of course I went inside and sat at the complete opposite side of there 3 piece sectional well come about an hour inside still at complete opposite sides of the couch her mom and \"step dad\" walk in and after getting yelled at for about 30 minutes they told me I either leave her or I marry her well me being me and trying to be an alpha I practically said fuck you watch this and married her after 6 fucking months, is it just me or does this count as a forced marriage. I cant get over what happened that day even after 2 years I don't think it's even a possibility for me to forgive them, I absolutely love my wife but I feel like I'm broken because I haven't let go of it I honestly dont know what to do and talking hasn't gotten me anywhere besides wanting to cry for days on end", "subreddit": "friendship"}

From then until we were in about 7th grade, we were best friends. We lived in different cities because I moved shortly after we met, so we went to different schools but still kept in touch. \n\nAround our 8th grade year, she kinda ghosted me. She would no longer invite me over for anything - and if I tried to reach out she would say she was busy. I would maybe see her on my/her birthday, and our moms became friends through us, so we would see each other on holidays sometimes. \n\nWhen she stopped talking with me, at first I was really sad and hurt. It was really hard for me to see her posting pictures with her new friends and that sort of thing. But my life went on, and so did hers, and we hardly saw each other through highschool. I would go to her birthday parties and be surrounded with people I didn't know, and because she had only texted me to invite me - I wouldn't have caught up with her in  many months. So after her last party, I decided I wouldn't go to any more if she invited me. \n\nFast forward to now - her and I have finished our first years of college. Her mom and my mom are best friends and see eachother every week or so, and sometimes I would pick my mom up from her house if she drank too much. The last couple times I've picked my mom up, her mom will say \"friend really wants to see you!!! you should hang out with her! she said she really wants to hang out with you a lot over the summer!\". \n\nThe thing is, I've kinda moved on from that friendship, and grew tired of trying to reach out all the time, just to be rejected or ignored. She hasn't reached out to me at all trying to make plans, and I feel like if she really did want to see me as much as her mom says, she would've said something by now. \n\ntl:dr - friend ghosted me years ago, now her mom is saying she wants to spend time with me, but she hasn't reached out to me.

Today, I am completely unhappy with life and not sure what to do.", "author": "HelpImLostHere", "self_text": "Bit of a backstory:\n\nFor the last few years I have felt like I have completely wasted my youth. Like, you see on TV how kids are constantly going out together, doing fun stuff like going camping, climbing, travelling together and adapting on their hobbies together. But not me. I live in the UK, so stuff like this isn't available everywhere and our culture isn't as... \"fun\", I guess you could say? The youth life in the US seems so much more eventful, and it's something I wish I had.\n\nRandom extra info: I finished season 3 of stranger things yesterday and the ending made me tear up so much, I cried for an hour. Not even just tears here and there, I was full on sobbing and I was shaking so much. I know getting stuff off your chest helps a lot so I googled, \"I need someone to talk to\" (this helps, please do this if you are suffering mentally!) but realized it's 1am...what am I doing...? I messaged a friend to see if she was awake and she was. I got everything off my chest, we spoke for 2 hours, and I was all fine by the end of it. But i'm at work so upset today, I feel like crying.\n\nI am 20, and I honestly don't know how to explain this, but I really want to live the american high school life. As an adult, I legit want to go to high school in the US and experience it all. I wish I had friend's that were all up for doing fun stuff like this but my friends just want to drink (I don't drink!) or play video games. I won't lie i'm addicted to video games, which correlates to why I feel like I wasted my youth. I sit inside for hours on end after finishing work and spend my weekends playing Xbox. I have done things recently to get me away from that addiction and spend less time at home but it's not making me as happy as I want it to be. I have a lot of goals in my life, and living in the UK is making me really unhappy. I want to live somewhere I can find a group of friends like in the movies...think of the cast of Stranger Things. They're friends in real life, they're chasing their dreams, they're successful, constantly in touch, and in the show they do so much together like going to the mall and having fun with each other etc. Honestly having both a guy and girl best friend would be amazing. The last girl \"best friend\" I had, I ended up falling in love with her, and asking her out etc. It was going well, waited a while and after saying yes it ended in less than 2 weeks and our friendship died out which broke me.\n\nTo summarize; i'm not happy with the way my life is going. I haven't gone to university because I get distracted SO easily and find it hard to just...pick stuff up and learn. For example, i'm at work right now...and i'm typing this out instead of working. I'm addicted to redditing and everything but doing work. I want to have a group of friend's that are adventurous but I really cannot do that here in the UK. I have been saving for a year or so, it's not too much but it's not little and I want to just... move away. I want to adventure out into the US as this is the ideal life I want to lead but there are also other countries I would like to move to but the language barriers would make it hard. I have no clue what to do honestly. Even finding work abroad would be hard. I don't want to be working in a super market, I want to have a high paying job and I am willing to get the education needed but...I don't want to spend 3 or 4 years studying here in the UK. I would love to study abroad, but scholarships and tuition fees are a barrier completely.\n\nPlease, what do I do? What should my next steps be? I hate feeling like this. It's painful.

And i don't know how to deal with this.\n\nThis all started a while ago, where my friend David(not his real name) noticed self harm scars on my arm, I'm not sure when he noticed, but I know for sure that he did. He never told me, he just pulled three of my other friends aside at lunch time, one of them, who I call Will(fake name) insisted that I'd been doing it for attention and that I \"never knew true sadness\"(apparently). Another, Owen(fake name) just went along with what Will had said, not having an opinion of hi sx own. My friend Ben(fake name) pulled me aside later, expressing genuine concern and told me what they'd been saying about me, after that, Will refused to speak to me and when other people asked why he apparently said \"we don't like her anymore, she did something\". Owen still spoke to me since we shared a few mutual friends, but honestly treated me like shit. He was just really passive aggressive towards me. David, the one who'd noticed in the first place, didn't address what was going on, and kept hanging out with me, treating me normally. I stopped hanging out with all of them after \"Ben\" told me that they'd been trashing me behind my back. David, Will and I were forced into a group together for a project, noticing that they'd been whispering about me in class, I started crying. I really couldn't take it, they weren't saying much, just making fun of how I looked and such, at this point the teacher was asking me if I wanted to go home and I eventually ended up telling her what was going on, she spoke to them and they came back ten minutes later and began whispering to eachother, and I could hear them clearly. \"We're gonna lose, she's crying!\" I kept hearing from Will. David refused to speak and kept saying it was Wills fault and eventually Will apologizes and states a fake reason so he doesn't have to say the real reason he was pissed. Everything goes well for the rest of the day until I open a message I get from another friend,  who I'll call Daniel, he told me what they'd been saying behind my back, I confronted Will about this and he started talking about how I was making everyone's lives miserable by \"always looking for attention\".

Do we just stop being friends?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI  was raised in a single mother, put myself through college, poverty type background. My wife has a similar background. Long story short, we both work hard and well and ensure we are paid for that work. It has made us wealthy. In addition, we have decided to not have children. The result is excess income which resulted in investments that resulted in excess income. We are wealthy (we are in the 1% in terms of income &amp; net wealth) and for a long time we didn't really spend that money. We lived in a tiny house that had less than a $1k/mo mortgage. We carry no debt. We drive 10 year old cars. Other than a few over the top small items we just kept our expenses small. We did have a very nice wedding (lived together and purchased a house before marriage) as you only get to do that once (fingers crossed).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are now in our 30s and decided that we should start spending some of this money we have. So we sold our tiny house and got a decent sized house, but upgraded everything, customized everything. It is simply a fantastic house. However the price is public knowledge and our friends know how much it costs (3-5 times what their houses cost). In addition, we redid the entire outside landscaping, driveway, etc. as we like to host parties and have people over. That has easily cost over $30k and we aren't done with some things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur friends started asking questions as they were worried we were living beyond our means or taking on large debt. When we simply stated that we aren't in any debt they started to connect the dots. One of our more blunt female friends straight up asked us if we are rich and I didn't know how to answer so I said \"it depends on what you mean\". Her response was \"Only a rich person would say that\" and then asked if we inherited money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways.......it isn't just her. All of our friends now treat us differently. They try to impress us with things that I honestly don't care about. They buy nicer food/drinks when we come over even though we know that isn't really reasonable for them. They make snide comment from time to time about how we have so much. They say things like \"just hire x for that\" or other things that I would never have thought they would say. We have a solid set of couples we hang out with and all but one is acting differently. This has been going on for \\~1yr now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have also made new friends and when they come over and see our house they immediately understand we were are financially and they start doing the same things (usually less blunt).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be clear, we don't talk about money or how much things cost. We don't brag or muse on how we will spend our money around others.We are 100% careful to not be flippant in financial discussions. We just do our thing and try to be polite and generous when it is socially acceptable to do so. I just don't know if hanging out with them is worth it anymore. I don't want us to feel bad. It has occurred to us that we should just go make friends with people in a similar economic situation so this isn't an issue, but that saddens us.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm a 27 year old guy living on the East coast of the US. My fiance' and I just moved into a new place, and I've noticed that I've been spending more time by myself than I'd like. I used to have plenty of friends, but for one reason or another, we've just drifted apart. I'm sure most of you can relate. So I'm really interested in building some new friendships.\n\n\nSome info about myself: I enjoy good conversations, cooking, working out, and trying new things. I spend the majority of my free time, both alone and with my fiance', watching tv/movies, or gaming. So I'll expand on those couple areas a bit more.\n\n\n*Music - I listen to a huge range of different stuff, but my favorite genre is metal. I really enjoy power metal and folk metal, but I get into pretty much anything that isn't black metal. I'm a huge fan of alternative stuff too. Some of my favorite bands are Sabaton, Trivium, Kamelot, Tyr, Parkway Drive, Khemmis, and Evans Blue.\n\n\n*TV/Movies - My fiance' and I spend a good chunk of our free time together in front of the TV. If a movie looks decent, we're going to see it. If a show looks even remotely interesting, we're going to binge it. It's really hard to narrow down a list, but I will say my favorite movie is Inglorious Basterds, and my favorite show is Parks and Recreation.\n\n\n*Gaming - Gaming is probably my main hobby, if I had to pick one. If it isn't an obscure indie game, I've probably played it or at least heard of it. I have every current console and a solid gaming PC. Always happy to find new people to game with! The list of games I'm working on is always changing, but I'm always open to giving new games a try if someone is interested in playing together.\n\n\nThis post got a little longer than I wanted it to, but it's probably better to include too much rather than not enough. If any of this sounds like it might interest you, please feel free to send me a PM! I have discord/kik for communicating, and if we hit it off I'm happy to exchange numbers. I would appreciate if you could include some info about yourself in your message. Age, gender, location, and a few lines about your interests/personality would be fantastic.

Based on this overview, do you think that my \"best,\" friend backstabbed me and that I should terminate our friendship?\n\n  In 4 years my best friend, Shelby has done many wonderful things in our friendship such as:\n\nBeing my only friend in church when others bullied me.\n\nBeing the only friend that stayed by me for years when other left me. \n\nLetting me vent to her often.\n\nShowing up at my house when she feared for my safety because of my ex.\n\nMade me file a police report against my crazy ex.\n\nTalked me into moving out of state with her.\n\nAllowed me to come live with her rent free  and share a bed with her for a year while I got on my feet (which will be discuused later on).\n\nLoaned me money more than once without wanting me to repay it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where things get complicated. Shelby had talked me into moving out of state with her (mentioned above). She was living with a \"nice ministry couple,\" and had arranged that I could stay there too until I got on my feet.    She agreed that I could sleep in her room until I got on my feet.  So I packed up everything and moved out of state to join her in a new state.\n\nOnce I moved here, the minister's  wife hated me,  Straight up hated me. I had only been there only a few days when the wife would just glare at me/ignore me when I made small talk,  and overall treat me like shit for no reason. The first week I was there, during a dinner party in front of her friends, the wife complained about her \"food being eaten and there not being any leftovers \" while looking at me. Mind you I don't eat a lot and had already bought food for the house my first day there. I asked to have a sit down with the wife to see if If done anything to offend her, she said \"no but try not to talk to me as much\" and brushed me off.\nOne time out of the blue the wife told me that I'm not godly or loving.  I calmly asked her what made her come to that conclusion and asked for examples and said \"I can just tell that you aren't Godly.\"\nMind you, I am respectful, clean and bought food for the house  multiple times and watched their daughter many times for free while living there. The wife continued to treat me like shit and due to my hours at work being cut, I could not yet to afford to move out.\n\nShelby saw that the wife and husband treated me like shit.  This is where her behavior changed. While living there, Shelby did the following which I feel are grounds for terminating our friendship:\n\nWhen I complained about how the wife had treated me, Shelby said \"Please don't talk that way about my \"family.\"\n\nWhen the wife accused me of stealing their glasses (I did not of course) Shelby casually said \"well, she doesn't know you, so of course she will assume that it's you who took them.\"\n\nLiterally minutes after I had cried/complained to her how the husband and wife treated me like shit, Shelby would leave the room and be laughing and cuddling with the wife (which happened on more than once).\n\nWhen Shelby told me that the wife was talking shit about me, I asked her what the wife said and Shelby said, \"I don't need to tell you her secrets. If I do, then I get to tell her yours. That's only fair,\"\n\nWhen I had my hours cut completely at work and was asked to buy food for the house, I asked Shelby who had a job  at the time to help buy food for the house (which she always ate because she refuses to eat out) and she casually said \"no, I was told by them that I don't ever need to buy food,\" \n\nWhen the wife randomly yelled at me (over nothing) and made me cry, I ran to Shelby's room and broke down crying about it, Shelby was quiet. The next day she came to me and said \"I don't want to be in the middle of this anymore. So I'm done being in the middle of it.\"\nI've also told shelby numerous times how I felt and she simply said \"I've defended you multiple times and I'm done being in the middle\" and she saw the emotional abuse I faced.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

The new class I got was Automation and Robotics. In that class I met this girl (She was in 8th grade, I was in 7th). I took an immediate liking to her because we had A LOT in common. like we watched the same YouTubers, both liked memes and both had the same sense of humor. I really wanted to be her friend but I'm a really shy person and never had the nerve to start a conversation with her. Every day that semester I would go to that class challenging myself to talk to her but I always chickened out of it. Fast forward to the last days of school and we actually started to talk a little bit  and I was happy, until I realized since she was 8th grade and I was in 7th that she was going to the high school next year and I wouldn't be able to talk to her for a long time. on the very last day of school when we were walking to the buses to go home, I swallowed my fear and stopped her on her way to her bus and told her that I thought the was pretty cool and wanted to know her more. We exchanged Reddit usernames and we have chatted on Reddit PM's a couple times since then. The problem is that I'm not sure if she really wants to be friends with me. It's always me starting the message conversation's and sometimes in the middle of the conversation she just stops messaging and doesn't respond to what I messaged her until like the next day and she acts like nothing happened.

We have lived together for just over a year, and I\u2019ve noticed separate weird things with both of them in that time. \n\nFirst, my roommate \u201cT\u201d hasn\u2019t really done anything too bad, except she constantly has her friends from out of town come and stay with us for anywhere from one night to a week at a time, and never asks me about it or even tells me in advance. Now, we have similar groups of friends obviously so I never mind them coming to stay with us, but it seems theres at least one person crashing on our couch every few weeks which gets exhausting. I also wish she would at least ask, as I feel that its just the considerate thing to do. Its not that I would say no necessarily, but I think I deserve to know who will be staying in my apartment with me and when. \n\nIn addition to this I\u2019ve noticed within the past couple of months she is becoming quite cold to me. We used to text almost every day just about stuff that happened to us, making jokes, whatever but now she hardly even talks to me when we are both home. I ask her about her life and herself and she is vague and seems bored or annoyed with me for doing so, and never asks me about myself ever. I even went on a week long trip and when I came back she didnt ask how it went. I cant think of anything I might have done that would have caused this change, especially because it was so gradual, I just miss her. \n\nThe problem is, I can\u2019t ask her why shes being distant because whenever one of her friends has told her in the past that she has been a bad friend to them in anyway she got mad and would talk to me about it saying that they expect too much of her.  It hurts me that she seems to not care about me anymore. \n\nMy other roommate, \u201cS\u201d is a different story. From the very first week we moved in together she has been extremely mean and aggressive about nearly everything. I mean 90% of the time, even if we aren\u2019t talking about anything important her tone is so rude, it\u2019s like she always has to disagree about everything even if it doesnt matter at all. She is like this with everyone, but mostly me. \n\nOther times shes yelled at me for putting things in the garbage when they are recyclable (i didnt) and not washing dishes (they weren\u2019t my dishes) and even for changing my mind and deciding i didnt want to go to a party when i said earlier i did. She is just such an angry person, and on top of that, never cleans never does her OWN dishes (even when she goes away for a week!) and leaves her stuff everywhere, and has cleaned the kitchen and bathroom only two times in a year so it doesnt make sense that she is so anal about other people doing it. She does all of this, and i\u2019ve never brought it up because if i ever try to confront her about anything she gets very aggressive.

The new class I got was Automation and Robotics. In that class I met this girl (She was in 8th grade, I was in 7th). I took an immediate liking to her because we had A LOT in common. like we watched the same YouTubers, both liked memes and both had the same sense of humor. I really wanted to be her friend but I'm a really shy person and never had the nerve to start a conversation with her. Every day that semester I would go to that class challenging myself to talk to her but I always chickened out of it. Fast forward to the last days of school and we actually started to talk a little bit  and I was happy, until I realized since she was 8th grade and I was in 7th that she was going to the high school next year and I wouldn't be able to talk to her for a long time. on the very last day of school when we were walking to the buses to go home, I swallowed my fear and stopped her on her way to her bus and told her that I thought the was pretty cool and wanted to know her more. We exchanged Reddit usernames and we have chatted on Reddit PM's a couple times since then. The problem is that I'm not sure if she really wants to be friends with me. It's always me starting the message conversation's and sometimes in the middle of the conversation she just stops messaging and doesn't respond to what I messaged her until like the next day and she acts like nothing happened. I actually messaged her like a week ago and she still hasn't responded to it. I'm  just confused and want to know if she really wants to be friends.

We met in middle school, and have been inseparable ever since. Anyway, buckle in cos this is gonna be long.\n\nSo, the first time I've had problems with her was when I went to college after high school. I moved a few states north, and she took a break from school so she stayed home. Well, I ended up hating the school I went to and I got really depressed and lonely, but whenever I tried to talk to her about it, she'd ignore me. Her excuse was always that she was \"bad at texting\". I ended up being completely miserable for the whole semester I was there, and decided to go back home.\n\nAfter that, things were mostly fine. We hung out and talked just like normal. Then I decided my life wasn't going anywhere and I joined the military. Once again, I got stationed really far away from home and the only time I get to see anyone from home is when I take leave during the holidays.\n\nShe and I texted pretty regularly, and we called each other a lot. Cos after college, I'd talked to her about how much it sucked to not have anyone to talk to while I was up there, and she finally understood. But then she started getting into this online game that I wasn't that interested in and just kinda...started ignoring me again. She ended up getting close to this group of online people, and eventually ended up dating one of the guys. She pretty much started cutting everyone out at that point. All of her time was invested in this guy, and she even stopped talking to her family for a while. She and I kinda got into a bad argument about this dude, because I was worried about her moving too fast with someone she barely knows, and she got mad at me about it. \n\nWe stopped talking for a long time. There was another incident while I was home that year, and I wanted to spend time with her but she told me that she'd rather spend the day online playing with her boyfriend. Even tho she had just gotten back from seeing him for 2 weeks and I was only home for 3 more days. I even picked her up from the airport when she got home.\n\nNow, she's moved in with this dude, and we only text if she texts me first. I don't even remember the last time I called her and she picked up. She sent me a snap the other day asking me something, and I happened to be busy that day so I didn't answer her immediately, and a few hours later she sent another saying \"No answer?\" Like...she almost never responds when I text her anymore. And that just really pissed me off. Before we got into those huge arguments, I would answer her immediately and I would try to talk and catch up with her all the time.\n\nShe never really did the same for me, and I know that our schedules are completely different so we can't talk 24/7, but am I wrong for thinking I'm the only one putting in effort in this friendship? And would it be petty of me to just slowly start blocking her on everything? I've tried talking to her so many times about how much she's changed, but she always tries to flip things back on me and make me feel like it's my fault. I'll admit I have my own hangups and flaws, but I was still the one who was there for her for almost everything. And now she barely does the same for me.\n\nTL;DR: I feel like my friend of 10+ years is ghosting me; would it be wrong of me to block her and ghost her back?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We come back to visit every 2-3 years, and I don't know if it's the fact that I haven't been in touch other than through social media and when I visit in person or if its the fact that we're now in our early 20s, but it feels like a lifetime since our childhood/early teen years because so much has changed. \n\nWhen my parents visit friends its like nothing has changed and they are included in events and conversations as if they had never left. For me, it's like looking at what my life could have been like if I had never moved away. When I see my friends its always pleasant and we have great catching-up conversations but because we are all in college and work its hard to meet up. On my earlier visits, we would make sure to hang out at least a few times per visit and were SO excited to see each other. Now, it feels like there is so much emotional distance between us. Two of my friends have gotten engaged and I found out through social media. I could not be happier for them but I just feel guilty that I only knew because of instagram. Another friends father passed away, and I didn't even know about his condition until a couple days before he passed, and I wish I could have been there for her in person. They all know each others friends and hang out whenever they're in town, essentially they're a trio. When I see them I always feel like a fourth wheel because they know all about whats happening in each others lives and it feels so awkward because I need to be updated every 2 minutes. I also feel out of the group because so much has happened in their personal lives (relationships, fiances, illnesses, college, etc.) that I completely was not present for. I only heard about these things through my mom or sister who are in touch with their friends. Recently, one of the girls had a bridesmaids party and my two other friends were invited. Of course, I don't expect to be in the wedding because there's a high chance I won't be able to attend due to the distance (I live on opposite side of the world) but mostly because we aren't close anymore. She also regularly posts pictures of the three of them when they hang out and calls them \"forever friends\" I am happy for them but it makes me feel weird especially because we were always a group of 4 back in the day.\n\nI was able to attend another's engagement party but felt like a fourth wheel because people kept taking pictures of \"the three of them\". Also, my two other friends got there early to help her get ready and I wasnt told about going early to help out.  They tried to include me in the pictures but it felt so awkward. Im just confused as to where our friendship stands. At this point I feel so unwanted as a friend from the past that shows up every couple years. I sent them a snapchat showing I was in town, and one of my friends made a group chat and asked how long I was in town for. I said a month, and she said \"good, plenty of time to hang out\" and the other 2 agreed. Im leaving in a week and we still have not met up other than during a party where we didn't really get to have a proper conversation. No one has said anything on the group chat since then.\n\nI do not expect them to be in touch all the time or go out of their way to reach out to me because we all have a lot going on. I just wish we would be in touch enough so that we knew what was happening in each others' lives not through social media or in person necessarily but even just through occasional texts would be nicer. I admit that I am not good at keeping in touch at all and I'm working on it, and of course this distance is my fault too. I just feel like maybe it's too late to go back to being friends the way we were when we were teenagers. Other times I feel like it'll change when I move back, and we would see each other more. I just feel sad at the thought that when I move back in a couple years I'll come back to a group of childhood friends that is as close, if not closer, without me in it. \n\nI apologize for the long post, but this was something I couldnt really share with my family or my other friends because they wouldn't get it. Our parents assume we are still close friends because they are still close. I dont know if I should move on and stop considering them as friends or make an effort to hang out/talk? I dont want to stop being friends with them at all because we grew up together and will always run into each other, but also because theyre great people. I didn't feel this distant till this year. Just a couple of years ago things were great and I never felt so left out. I just can't tell whether or not our friendship is over. I think it would have been easier if I had moved away and lost touch completely but because I visit and our families are friends its even more confusing. I wonder if they have they outgrown me or if it'll be different when I move back. I would really appreciate any advice on how to deal with this feeling or what I should do.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Her boyfriend is staying with us until the end of the week, so I am not able to speak with her privately until then.\n\n1. How do I cope with being worried about how far my secrets have spread in our mutual friend group?\n2. How can I convince her that what she is doing is wrong? I sincerely feel that we are both too old for this behavior, and am honestly in shock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Context**: My roommate and I have known each other for about a year. We were fairly close friends prior to living together, and have lived together since February. Since knowing her, I have confided a lot about my family problems, sex life, personal relationships, my past, etc. to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The situation**: I've found out that my roommate is using my personal life as gossip. It seems as though she is mostly doing this when trying to make fun of me (and possibly to make herself look better). This always happens specifically around men.\n\nThis problem began when I found out that she had told her coworkers a couple of personal stories about my sex/dating life that were embarrassing and/or upsetting to me. While it bothered me a little that she was sharing things I had confided to her, I rarely interact with these people\u2014although I wish I recognized this as a red flag earlier.\n\nFor example, she was on the phone with a man who lives in another state. I was in the room when they were talking on speakerphone. He was asking her about a man she was recently seeing (who it didn't work out with), he then asked her to take him off speakerphone. I could still hear him, and he said something along the lines of: \"well at least you didn't do something as bad as (me)\" and proceded to make fun of me. She laughed. I wanted to stick up for myself I said \"wtf\"!?. She didn't respond to me, went to her room, and proceeded to talk for a few hours. I didn't bring it up again\u2014typing this all out has made me realize I should have stuck up for myself a lot sooner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Getting worse**: She met the man (23M) she is currently dating 6 weeks ago\u2014we all met the same night, and he and his brother have become quite close with my/my roommate's mutual friends. I had suspected that she was sharing embarrassing things about me to her boyfriend because of random comments they would make around me.\n\nWhat really made me reach my breaking point was when we were all hanging out with a group of mutual friends and her boyfriend mentioned something very personal about me involving a man that I was recently seeing. This was something personal and embarrassing to me (although she found it funny that I was horribly rejected and upset about it) that I confided in her. Her boyfriend brought it up (in the group) as a joke. I was shocked that she had told him, so I said something along the lines of \"I can't believe you told him that\" and she responded by laughing and saying, \"of course I'm going to tell everyone, it's hilarious.\" So, not only is she gossiping about my (very) personal problems, she does not think she is doing anything wrong.\n\nThe following day, we were out with the same friends and the man that I am currently interested in (for context: been on a few dates but choosing to take it slow). My roommate decided to engage in a conversation with him about my recent/failed dating attempts. She started to say incredibly inappropriate things about how \"desperate\" I was for even \"unattractive\" men (I honestly don't even know where that came from). I stood up for myself and told her to stop. She responded by laughing and telling me to \"stop being a bitch,\" but did change the subject. We were in public and it was SO difficult to stay calm after that, especially because she says these horrible things with such a light-hearted tone, so when I raise my voice, I'm self-conscious that I look like I'm over-reacting. Thankfully, I spoke with the man involved and he seemed to see through her behavior.\n\nThe connecting factor is that she is constantly doing this in front of men, and I really think she is trying to make herself feel or look better around them. Could I be right? She is really unsatisfied that I am happy being single at the moment (when we moved in together she was adamantly trying to find a boyfriend) and tries to convince me otherwise (this part I really don't understand).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now**: I'm uncomfortable because I don't know how much she has shared and who knows what. I regret not sticking up for myself sooner, although the last few events have happened within the last couple days. I don't know how to cope with hanging out with these people because I'm terrified she's going to reveal something personal about me and/or use my insecurities against me. She does not seem to think she's doing anything wrong, and I worry that this will continue. Obviously, I am going to be super careful about what I share with her. But is there any chance of saving this friendship? Is there any way of convincing her/showing her that this behavior is wrong when she seems to have a completely different philosophy about what it means to be a friend?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : My roommate (26F) is sharing personal things about my life to make herself look better in front of men. I am uncomfortable and don't know how to cope because even if she stops, so much of my personal life is \"out there\" now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Also posted in /relationships.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

That being said, I tend to be a bit more aloof than most. I have a few hobbies, and I am very future oriented, and I can be extremely competitive in intellectual regards. I also tend to be a perfectionists and take great pride in my work, if I'm not proud of a project, no one will get to see it.\n\nI tend to take a while to open up, generally the more you try to lull me into opening up, the more I close off. This is a big downfall of mine, and has lead the remorse filled excisions of friends. I have ghosted before, and I am certain I'll eventually do it again. I am not sure why I do it, but I know it doesn't happen because I like the person I am friends with. I think it has something to do with repression, but I'm rambling at this point.

I was horribly shy as a kid and didn't find my voice until after highschool, so she was my main friend from kindergarten on. She was overwhelmingly negative but I never noticed or cared. She constantly left me out, gave me backhanded compliments, ditched me, and never let go of any mistake I made, especially if the mistake related to her in any way. I never questioned any of that, never saw any of those traits as red flags, and always just wanted hey friendship.\n\nB has very poor mental and emotional health. I suspect she has a personality disorder. Her father is a text book narcissist and sociopath and she was always in the shadow of her older brother who has severe health issues. So I understand why she is the way she is and I have done everything I can to have grace and empathy. But she has taken advantage of my friendship. She threatens suicide constantly, I've been on the phone with her for hours at a time taking her down (I've only once been honestly worried she would actually hurt herself, all other threats felt like attention seeking but I still responded to them as of they were serious). O eventually had to call the police on her to have her take to an inpatient psych ward. She talked herself out of there and was discharged after just three days despite a doctor saying she needed a 7 day stay. After she got out, she stayed at my house for three days. She demands my attention 24/7 and when I try to give her advice she belittles me and dismisses what I'm saying. She has yelled at me while I'm on the phone with her at 1 on the morning trying to encourage her and get her through a melt down.\n\nEventually her negativity and manipulative behaviors drug me so far down I turned to self-harm, something I hadn't done since 2014. At that point my boyfriend begged me to walk away from her, but I can't give up on people. I distanced myself from her and cut contact for 4 days. When I reached out to see how she was doing, she was horrible. She told me that she was disappointed in me and that it only takes a second to check in on a suicidal friend. She refuses to move on from her past hurts and Dixie's only on the negative. If you try to vent to her, get advice, or get support, she compares your life to hers and reminds you that she has had it worse and you should just be grateful. I'm very deeply wounded by her words and actions, but I can't tell her because she just gets angry and points out your every flaw and blames you for everything when you try to talk to her about her behavior.\n\nI know I need to sever contact with B and I have always known her mental health would cause out friendship to deteriorate, I just didn't expect it to happen so suddenly. I've known her my whole life, she feels more like a sister than a friend. I am terrified that if I walk away, she'll hurt herself and, even though this wouldn't be true, I will feel like her blood will be on my hands. If she were mentally stable, I would not feel so obligated to be in her life and would have had a conversation with her by now and would have walked away. She's co-dependant, overwhelmingly negative, self-absorbef, shallow, and petty. But she also has some great qualities and I always hope that she'll get better and her good qualities will overwhelm the bad ones. I know I can't sustain this friendship but I have no idea how to navigate this. Does anyone out there have advice? How can I set healthy boundaries without risking her hurting herself? I know I can't save her and I am not liable for her actions, but I've always fought for things. I don't give up, this is new territory for me. TIA!! :) :)", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I just don\u2019t know what to do and need help\n\n\nOk so, I honestly don\u2019t know what to do rn,\n\nMe: me\nTF: toxic friend\nCC: my amazing friend\n\nIma start at the beginning, I met tf beginning of 6th grade. At first we would just hang out and ya know be friends, later on in the year I noticed she was starting to be REALLY clingy, calling me every day, getting mad if I didn\u2019t pick up, pretty much forced me to play Minecraft with her ( don\u2019t get me wrong MC is a great game! She just kinda ruined it for me) and got mad when I hung out with other people. Let\u2019s skip over like mid 6th grade, I invited her on a ski trip with my family and a close family friend family (idk either) this couple had 3 sons 1 was around my age 1 was around my brothers age (like 8 or 9) and the other other one was around 5, we get to the cabin we were staying at, and all the snow melted at the skiing place, we went fore wheeling instead. Fun right? Well not for TF she started to complain about not going skiing and all that crap, lemme get this straight this wasn\u2019t cheap, like $100 for a bike thingy and she was complaining about going there for free!? It\u2019s not that she was scared or anything she just wanted to go skiing instead, ok so after we finished fore wheeling she complained about getting off and wanting to stay longer...... yup story of my life right here folks. Okay so we got back to the cabin thing and we were upstairs talking about the fore wheeling when I go to the bathroom to change and here a thud... and then crying. I ran out to see what the living heck was happening when I see family friend family kid #2 (the 8-9 year old one) on the ground, holding his stomach, crying. Let me just say. I had only seen this kid cry once before, when he broke his arm. Not when he scraped his knee, not even when he ripped off his toenail (long story short don\u2019t ride a bike with flip flops) I ask him what happened and he told me that TF kicked him, at this point his parents had come upstairs I see what happened, let me just tell you that was the first time I had ever seen his dad mad, after that I go up to TF and ask \u201cWhy the heck would u kick an 8 year old!?\u201d She simply shrugged and answered \u201che was being annoying.\u201d I walked away before I could say anything to offend her little fantasy world... (did I forget to mention that out family friend family was our pastor and his family?) \nok fast forward a bit to 7th grade, I could tell like a 100 stories of what happened in between these events but, I\u2019m to lazy.. anyway. TF got her first boy friend, at this point I had already met CC. Let me just tell you I already knew this was gonna end badly. And I was right, (spoiler) they broke up, but let me tell you how it happened (HP = tf ex bf) hp and I were not really friends but we got along seeing how we were both liked reading. Hp had told tf he was gonna break up with her bc she was causing to much stress and stuff, tf quote on quote \u201cNO I\u2019m breaking up with YOU first!\u201d She came to me crying the next day... ugh I mean come on we were in 7th grade, wasn\u2019t expecting this to go far, but I didn\u2019t say that to her face, me and HP happened to be paired up to dissect frogs for science, tf told me to NEVEr talk to him and I couldn\u2019t be friends with him either... ugh time skip to summer before 8th grade, \ntf had been making me and CC feel bad for hanging out without her and making us feel guilty for stuff out of our control, CC and I had plans to go to New Jersey and visit NY, while helping out with CC\u2019s grandmother\u2019s VBS. Tf found out about this, tbh I haven\u2019t hung out with Tf at all that summer, and honestly wasn\u2019t planning to either, she started dragging CC into the drama telling her that I\u2019d been ignoring her and that we were her only friends and that she felt left out, I call bs, anyways she then started texting me saying how she was setting up a calendar for times we can hang out, so here I am 30 minutes after she texted me venting on reddit, idk what to do, now that all the main stuff is out the way ima vent on the smaller stuff she\u2019s done,\n\nTold me to chose between her and another close friend (I could write a whole other story on this topic tbh)\n\nTold me what encores I should chose and that I should quit band and join choir JUST so I could be with her ( I didn\u2019t band kid 4 life)\n\nOkay this ones pretty long, 5 months before the end of school she asked me to go on a beach trip with her, i said sure 1 month later I found out that my family had planned a trip to go see relatives I haven\u2019t seen in over a year, I told her that I couldn\u2019t go and explained why, she said it was too late to invite anyone else, she had 4 months..... the next year i got invited again.. I said yes seeing how we had no trips planned she said like 3 weeks before they went that I couldn\u2019t go, kinda happy I didn\u2019t have to go honestly (she planned it out Incase u didn\u2019t figure it out lol)\n\nTold CC and her parents that I was being\nMean to her, CC just ignored her, she knew the situation I was in (btw I really wasn\u2019t I\u2019m honestly a pushover)\n\nOkay I think that\u2019s enough for now, any suggestions on what I should respond to her? I\u2019ll keep u guys updated.. thanks for reading it really means a lot\n\n\nEDIT: K, so I ended up ignoring her, (I want a drama free summer ok) but after I got back from NJ me and three other ppl decided we should go to an popular amusement park (let\u2019s call it C)\nAnyways the people were going to be me, CC, and two others we will call P1 and P2 (person 1 and person 2 lol) so we had a group chat, we agreed not to invite TF, 1. She hates heights and won\u2019t ride any of the fosters and 2 (which only me and CC know about) the tension between me and tf,)\nP1 and tf are close \u201cfriends\u201d and P1 told tf about our meet up we were planning. (Gosh friggin dang it P1) TF almost instantly contacted CC, asking her why she didnt invite her.... ( no offense but who does that?) CC explained it was she told us she hated coasters and heights,( which was true) tf said \u201coh but that was 3 months ago, I\u2019m over it.\u201d Or something along the lines of that. TF then made a NEW group chat consisting of everyone in the original group, including her...\n( the original group of 4 ppl including me had made a group a while ago and had made a lot of inside jokes, apparently TF was at P1 house while this was all happening, she must\u2019ve read or original group chat because she started to name the new group chat the name after the old one, which was a part of the inside joke..) so CC changed it to a different name, anyways after talking for awhile \nWe invited another person so it would be even, I honestly liked this person as a friend and had no complaints. But before that all happened TF sent me a message\n\n\u201cHey OP I\u2019m scheduling a date we can go to (insert really cool restaurant) together, I\u2019ll keep you updated when I find a date that suites me\u201d\n\nNot less than 3 mins later ( it was 9pm and I was watching my hero academia ok?)\n\n\u201cOP?\u201d\n\nThen she responds in a creepy format\n\n\u201cSo yeah! Respond whenever you can! :)\u201d\n\nOkay I might be over reacting but that was creepy as heck, like her only purpose do download an app was to change the font for that one message, or maybe I\u2019m just over reacting,\n\nIdk thanks for reading, comment any suggestions?\n\n(Here was what the last text looked like \u201c\ud835\udd4a\ud835\udd60 \ud835\udd6a\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd59! \ud835\udd4b\ud835\udd63\ud835\udd6a \ud835\udd65\ud835\udd60 \ud835\udd63\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd61\ud835\udd5d\ud835\udd6a \ud835\udd68\ud835\udd59\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd5f\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd67\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd63 \ud835\udd6a\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd66 \ud835\udd54\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5f \u30b7\u201d  ).

I've thrown away a lot of my friends, and kept the ones who I thought would matter. But why is it that I still feel lonely. \n\nI've had depression and anxiety my whole life. As I'm writing this, I'm actually going through an episode of depression. I stopped taking anti-depressants because they made me so... numb to life. As if I'm in an out-of-body experience, and I'm just watching myself go through life in such a black and white manner. My decision to stop taking anti-depressants were to bring myself back as a person. After I stopped taking them though, I switched back to cigarettes (which I've quit for a year before going back into it) because I couldn't handle the anxiety and depression. Mostly the anxiety. My friends urged me to quit after 6 months to which I did last week and, man. It's really rough. Maybe its the chemical imbalance in my head, or this is how I really felt prior to when I started taking all these substances like nicotine and anti-depressants. The result of this all is loneliness, and this feeling of yearning for a friend. \n\nI've told my two of my close friend about all of this, to which they are supportive to an extent. I just feel like such a burden to them. I don't want them to feel like that every time I'm around, its this negative Nancy who has a mental health disorder. So, I stopped sharing with them how I really feel, because at the end of the day, I feel as if I shouldn't be adding my own problems to their lives. Especially when they're not even remotely familiar with how it feels to have clinical depression and an anxiety disorder, so in essence, I'm just putting them in an uncomfortable spot.\n\nSo now, here we are. 2:39 in the morning with anxiety and depression running rampant in my head. What do I really want? A friend. What kind? Someone that I can talk to and relate with. Someone who wouldn't really ghost. Someone who would care for me and my mental health, just like I would with theirs. I take pride in being loyal and caring to my friends. Ride or die, amirite? A little more about me? I'm also gay. Not like it really matters, but to some straight men, finding out they're talking to some gay man might put them off, so I'm just saving those guys the time.\n\nIf you've reach this part of the post, congratulations and thank you for listening to my story.

I initially liked her ex, but after the breakup, it was obvious to me how selfish, and controlling he was.\nIn 2017, I was in a horrible accident and she came to visit me in rehab and contacted me regularly to see how things were. About a month  after I got out of hospital she met a guy through her work. He was in a relationship at the time that they met, but they started messaging and not long after he had left his then partner, and my friend and him became a couple. They had been together for almost 4 months when she got pregnant. I was excited for her, shocked, but she had always wanted to be a mother. I was concerned that she had been with him for barely 4 months and they were not using protection, a choice they had both made. In my opinion, you don't really know someone in that amount of time, so the fact that she could easily get pregnant and was ok about it, was mind-blowing to me! \nWe messaged regularly about her pregnancy and my recovery progress. We also shared our annoyances about our partners. Mine was blaming and criticising me for his inability to cope with my accident, and refused to get any help. Her pregnancy and delivery was complicated and the babies, she had twins, were difficult too. Instead of being supportive, her partner was verbally abusive. He called her names, and threatened to get a job travelling interstate so she would practically have to raise the babies alone for days at a time. He applied and got that job behind her back. That was a huge red flag to me. \nDuring this time, my partner ended our 7 year relationship. My partners abuse had intensified towards the end, but I was still an emotional wreck just thinking about life without the man I believed was my future. During the breakup I asked her advice of what best to do as I had never experienced a break up before and she was always so open about her relationship problems. She said that she was coping much better with the twins, and getting the hang of it. She however did mention that me asking if my ex's behaviour during the breakup was 'normal', made her feel that she was reliving her upsetting first marriage breakdown. I apologised profusely and backed off from speaking to her about it. I messaged her instead about what she was up to, how the babies and her were going and lighthearted things. Her responses were still quite short, cold and she didn't ask about my life. I was getting constant support from a wide range of people, mostly professionals, as my ex was being an a-hole. I also didn't want to pile my problems on friends, especially people like her who had their hands full with two babies under 1 year old. \nI have actually never met the babies, or her partner and every time I try and organise to see her she makes an excuse as to why I cannot. \nDuring the initial weeks of my breakup I could only see all the problems I was experiencing. I now realise that it was inconsiderate of me to not consider her stressful situation and her upsetting past. I have been told that my behaviour was pretty normal for someone going through the pain, confusion and loneliness of a long-term breakup with someone I deeply loved. I haven't contacted her for almost 2 weeks now, and have not heard from her either. We used to message every few days.  \n  Long before my breakup she told me how I was the only friend who bothered to contact her. How long should I leave it before reaching out? I think I am scared that she will not respond or that if she does she will be cold toward me.\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated as I feel very lost.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

From the beginning I've had this hunch that he's been interested in me. He's made comments like \"I wish I could make you mine\" to \"I could love you more than anyone else\" followed by \"I'm just kidding hahaha\". When we first started talking, I was going through a break up. I was mentally weak and couldn't help but vent to him. He started to really dislike my ex and when my ex came back into my life (we were on again off again) he took matters into his own hands. B told my ex I had slept with one of his friends. We were on the phone while this happened and I specifically told him \"No, don't say that. Seriously don't.\" He laughed and said \"Oops too late.\" For the next several weeks I had him out of my life until he had his friend tell me to join a ps4 party. He said he felt no remorse but he was sorry. He even admitted he was only saying sorry so I'd get over it. He claimed I needed religion and that he was doing \"God's job\", that it was meant for him to say that. I really liked his group of friends, and I was willing to give him another chance, even though his logic was stupid and I already started to really dislike him. I blocked him repeatedly for weeks at a time if he did something to push me over the edge. It's harsh I know, but he would spam me and if I got stern or pissy he'd pick a fight with me. He would constantly say things to hurt people and I think he got off on it. He made fun of the things I'm self conscious about. If someone tries to stand up for themselves he just laughs at them and acts like it isn't serious, but expects full attention if things aren't his way. He would expect me to take his side no matter what and would argue with me if I didn't. Things escalated then he took lsd and sent me a message at 1 am about how much he wanted to \"make love\" to me and even told me his size. The following week he asked if I'd judge a pic and see if it was okay enough to send to a girl. I expected a selfie but instead I got a picture of the other head. I started ignoring him after that and cut him off for awhile when my ex came back into my life. During that time he repeatedly messaged my sister asking if I'd unblock him, saying he just wanted to talk. If I ever blocked him I could never get away from him even if I removed all his friends too. At this point because I'm so sick of him. He's in my life again and I hate it. He'll bug me and get upset if I don't want to play video games. He'll constantly try to make me uncomfortable by saying things to other guy friends like \"I know if caffnip was older you'd be all over her\". He's tried to force religion onto me to the point of me snapping and yelling at him because he talks about it for 3 hours straight. He makes me so angry and I don't think I've ever wanted to beat someone up this much before. He says I'm his friend and that will never change. That he'll always be there for me and that he knows I like him. How do I get this toxic \"friend\" out of my life for GOOD.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Whenever I have asked him to speak in our mutual language trying to get involved in the conversation, he didn't respond and kept saying that you know everything we are talking about. The topic he was talking about is his problems with his new girlfriend and he said too many details. Like really too many details. After an hour of struggling, I was pretty mad about the inappropriate topic and the fact that I was unaware of what they were talking about. So I told him privately that his topic is really awkward and he is kind of socially dumb to speak a language that I can't understand.

I would just love some advice or support. I want to start with a disclaimer that I know that this is an irreparable mistake, and it is something that will haunt me for the rest of my life.\n\nThis story dates back about a year to when my best friend\u2019s father died. Back in October, my best friend from high school\u2019s father died fairly young (he was 55 and in great shape up until his passing) from liver cancer. I won\u2019t sugarcoat it: his death was slow and difficult, and by the time he left the earth he was quite skeletal and I can\u2019t even imagine my best friend\u2019s pain. Throughout his passing, my good friend had come home from college and taken the semester off. She lives in LA, thus coming home to our small town in New England is understandably sad and boring for her. We spent a lot of time together, and I was so grateful I could be there to help her through the days of waiting for his last breath.\n\nWe are both 22 years old, and although I just graduated from college, she has one semester left. Our background story is that we met in high school and really hit it off, and we have very similar values and have helped each other through depressive states. Although we had grown distant since her moving away from college, we were still very close whenever we got the chance to see each other.\n\nEssentially what happened is I overslept and missed her dad\u2019s funeral. I was in distress the night before due to the situation and spent quite a bit of time talking with my mom, and went to bed too late. I missed the funeral and was so upset with myself that I was too scared to even send her a text explaining what happened.\n\nWhat haunts me, is her telling me that while burying her father, she looked for me in the crowd, and I wasn\u2019t there. We are both very spiritual people, and I would say we both believe the universe has plans for us. Although neither of us are religious, I think symbolism in the real world is something we both use to derive meaning from life. I not being there at the funeral symbolizes a major, irreparable lack of support and love for my friend, and I don\u2019t know how I can attempt to gain her trust and make her understand that I care and value her journey through life as much as she does for mine.\n\nMissing the funeral was a simple mistake; I overslept because my 20 phone alarms weren\u2019t loud or obnoxious enough to stir me. But it doesn\u2019t matter and I know that. What matters is that I was not there.\n\nHow do I proceed? I am currently visiting her, and we can still enjoy each other\u2019s company, but I feel like I am unable to express just how sorry and how much I despise myself for my mistake. \n\nI think I\u2019m looking for support or any similar stories people can share. Either from a perspective of being let down by a friend in a major way, or having let someone down. I think time and support is something that can help or relationship, but I feel a great distance between us because of this. I want her to know that I care about her. \n\nHelp \u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

And yesterday, and today, it became clear that neither of us are seeing eye to eye because of our differing values.\n\nMy best friend and I have known each other since we were in 3rd grade. This was well over 20 years ago now, and he was a witness to all the crazy amount of psychological and emotional abuse my parents inflicted on me over the years through ups and downs, divorce, and not talking to my father for over 7 years. He lived in one part of the state where I'm originally from, and stayed there, but by the time we hit puberty, I had moved to a major city. He and I didn't see each other as often but the time we spent together was really important to me, and we kept constant contact through all that time. Last year, I moved back to where I'm originally from in order to fix things, and be closer to my family. Over the last year, he and I have hung out more than we ever have, and through ups and downs he was still there for me. \n\nCut back to my birthday last Tuesday, and certain behavioral issues and resentments had been building for the last number of months between not just the two of us, but with our mutual friend as well. By the end of the night, things exploded, and my friends told me what I needed to hear, for better and worse. And then, for a week, I didn't hear anything from either of them, and I had to sit with what they said. It hurt a lot.\n\nThen, Monday, my friend texted me acting like nothing had happened, and I was so angry, I didn't text him. Yesterday morning, I woke up, and I told him how I felt, again, for better and worse. What followed were multiple separate, huge texts between the two of us, in which it became abundantly clear to both of us that we are definitely not on the same page, so we have chosen to take a long term break.\n\nI still hold a lot of love and respect for the guy, as I know he does for me. He's a talented dude, but I felt like his behavior and values were not the same as mine and what I valued, and they were bringing me down, rather than raising me up.\n\nI'm not writing this with the hope of advice. I have had to cut off friends before, and other friends have cut me off too. Every time it's hurt, as it always tends to do. But this is different. A mutual parting of ways but not without some serious words spoken on both sides. Not going to lie, it still hurts though, simply because we were friends for so long, and we shared so much of our lives together.\n\nWhat I'm here to do is to let you to know it's okay to let go of friendships that aren't working anymore if you feel like issues can't be resolved, or your values have shifted, or even if you feel like you never knew them at all. That goes with any relationship. Don't ever regret letting go of people when you need to, especially when you need to figure things out. If you're meant to meet again, or even become friends, it will happen. One of you will build that bridge, but you have to be willing to let it sit, and give it time. And if it doesn't, then it wasn't meant to last, and that's fine too.\n\nDon't ever feel bad for expressing yourself. Just don't do what I did and hold back those issues for so long it ends things. That's what will get you in the end.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I\u2019m sorry for the late replies, I went insane on self care, I really needed to get myself together. That small heartbreak was ruining my life, I let everything go downhill because of that pain. Sometimes friendship breakups feel worse than relationship breakups. At least my ex didn\u2019t make me feel useless like that. It\u2019s just upsetting, the one person I\u2019d talk to about my ex, is now treating me worse than he did. Things change though, I understand, just feeling down because of this big ass gap in my heart. I\u2019m trying my best, I will make good use of all of this advice. I really appreciate you all, I never expected complete strangers to be there for me, rather than my own \u201cfriend\u201d. Thank you, I don\u2019t know where I would be rn if I hadn\u2019t gotten all this support. I feel a lot better knowing that people care. In return for your this kindness, I\u2019ll spread kindness in my own way. I hope you all enjoy your lives, I also hope something good comes to you.\n\n\nI\u2019ve had a best friend for almost 5 years, we hit it off immediately, we shared our secrets we wouldn\u2019t tell anyone else, we got into crazy trouble with each other, she would even tell me about her relationship because she trusted me. That one friendship was the highlight of my life, I didn\u2019t even care about her being my only friend because I had her, and I thought I would have her forever. We promised we\u2019d be friends until we\u2019re dead, because at the time we both believed we\u2019d be friends for as long as possible. She randomly became distant, I was the only one reaching out her. she always gave me response like \u201cok\u201d, \u201ccool\u201d, and \u201cttyl\u201d, I put up with that shit for months, I didn\u2019t want to complain and bother her until I got upset, I told her her how I felt, I explain that I felt unwanted, like she didn\u2019t need me anymore, and she literally told me we could cut it off, she didn\u2019t reply since.\n\nSo, I tried contacting her again, we weren\u2019t talking for about 6 months, and I truly missed her and still wanted the friendship so texted her. I asked her how she was doing, and i apologised if I did something wrong, etc. She accepted my apology but didn\u2019t want to get involved with me anymore, this broke my heart, literally. I was in the most vulnerable state when texting her because I was crying about ending our friendship about a week before. I prepared everything before hand, even the whole paragraphs, I wanted to make it sincere, I really wanted her back. But, that just didn\u2019t happen, I admit, my expectations were too high, i thought she\u2019d want to be friends again, and ended up hurting myself even more. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for any mistakes, or errors I\u2019m crying while writing this, I have no one else, she kept me happy for years, we both depended on each other until she started taking her relationship with her boyfriend seriously. I can\u2019t help but feel like it\u2019s my fault, I don\u2019t know maybe I wasn\u2019t supportive enough, I just feel so useful and unworthy of anything. I live alone so I end up staying up late due to work, because of that even when I don\u2019t have work I stay up late, that leads to me overthinking, i always think about the mistakes I made during that time. I miss my best friend, I miss all the friend fun we had, I miss the unique bond and trust we had, I miss being myself around her, now I don\u2019t know what to do without her.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

People I can talk to daily online and over the phone.", "author": "android161718", "self_text": "Hi everyone.\n\nI'm in a weird limbo in my life where I recently graduated college at the late age of 28. I had a really hard time when I was in school because I was struggling to try and pay my bills at the same time so I didn't really build a portfolio to show to any employers afterward. I have to take a few months after graduation to create one before I can start applying to places in my field.\n\nUntil then I am stuck working a solitary job sampling and serving alcoholic products in grocery markets at a booth by myself. Right now the company is only offering me like 2 shifts a week. I use to work retail for many years as a front-end supervisor but the whole constantly not having a backbone for the sake of customer service while being paid 10 cents above minimum wage for it became too much to handle. That is also in addition to working under miserable assholes and cokehead bosses. The economy in Ontario, Canada is really bad and no one will hire you for an unskilled job if you're some educated guy close to 30 who is not a newcomer or a high school student. So I am sort of stuck with this friendless job and working UberEats until I can hopefully find a job in my field in a few months.\n\nAt my age all your 'friends' are busy with their own careers and family and don't use their days off to hang out with me. A lot of them have also moved out of the city I live in. I have friends, but I see them once in a blue moon and usually effort and planning is involved. I'd join something like a martial arts gym to make friends but I simply don't have the means, I'm in a ton of debt that I need to pay off first.\n\nI have no sense of community whatsoever. It feels like I don't exist a lot of the time. When you're alone constantly the mind starts to play tricks on you. You can't focus on your priorities or hobbies because you're just not exercising that social muscle. So I need to build a community myself.\n\nI'm looking for a best friend or a group of friends of cool people around my age who won't just talk to me on discord for 1 day and then disappear or join it and not say anything. I'm not looking to befriend weird people either, I'm not a shy person and I would say I have developed social skills, it's just more of a life predicament I'm in that's not making me able to interact with a lot of people. We'll need to talk daily and be comfortable with hearing each other's voices. If I interact with you and you're being weird and awkward and giving 1 word answers to everything, then I'll most likely stop interacting with you. I also like people who listen and give constructive advice, because that is something I'd do for you.\n\nSome things about me and my interests:\n\n\\- Graduated in Web Design\n\n\\- I'm teaching myself the Ukulele\n\n\\- I have a PS4 and can play online. Final Fantasy is my favourite gaming franchise.\n\n\\- I am a Japanese culture enthusiast and am currently teaching myself Japanese with the hope I can go back to university and get a degree so I can try to be an Japanese interpreter or English teacher in Japan in the next stage of my life.\n\n\\- I like to read fiction and enjoy English literature in general.\n\n\\- I use to be a biology major and astrophysics minor in a past life (never graduated), so I can have talks about science.\n\n\\- I use to be a politics major in another past life (I dropped out of university twice) so I can hold up political discussions, although I don't really like to do that as much anymore.\n\n\\- I like intellectually stimulating talks in general.\n\nIf you've read everything I wrote and you think we'll click then message me. I have my own discord I made awhile ago, but no one is in there currently except 2 real life friends who I barely ever get to see and no one talks in there.\n\nI look forward to making some new friend!\n\nThanks to everyone who read this.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I've been bestfriends with this guy for over 12 years. We use to do everything together but I feel like now that I'm growing and changing I'm evolving differently than he is. Im 19 and hes 20. I just came back from living alone in California for 2 years. I got a scholarship to play soccer and study and I finished with an associate degree in business. I just came back to my home town in Australia and he has litterally not done anything since high school. As kids I would be the one to push him to do stuff. I took him with me to France, Vanuatu, road trips in Australia. I alone have traveled Europe and also seen pretty much every major city in California and I've visited around 20+ other countries with my family. I feel very motivated and cannot wait to start my life up. Him on the other hand is very unmotivated, depressed and \"stuck\". He doesnt have a car or even a driver's liscense, he doesnt have a job. He had 1 when I worked with a company and talked to the boss for him to come in and work (I got him in). It was fine for a while but after I left for college he started not getting any more shifts and got fired. He isnt studying and just overall does nothing with his life but stay at home with his working parents. Because he doesnt have any friends apart from me. \nI feel very bad for him but I need people in my life that push themselves and strive to be better. He keeps asking to hang out with me but he isnt friends with any of my friends so if I do hang out with him I have to take the day off to drive to pick him up and do things, when I could see lots of other people and do lots of other stuff. Since he doesnt have money (he spends it on cigarettes or at the casino) we dont do much stuff. He gets money from doing chores for his parents.\nI just dont really know what to do because I feel like if I cut him off theres also 12 years of my life that go with it. I still love him but I feel almost obligated to reply to him and it feels almost forced on my side.\nI've changed and grown so much but he still is that high school kid that hasnt done anything. \n\nAny advice?

(17M)", "author": "ElijahTheShark33102", "self_text": "Ok, so I'm going to start this by admitting that everything that has just happened is my fault. I know that I am the one to blame, and I feel absolutely horrible.\n\nI (17M) had a friend (16M) for 3 years (it has been a long time relative to my age), and he has legitimately been one of my two favorite people. He was my best friend. I loved him. Recently I found out he was a Trump supporter (If you are getting mad at me for being against Trump, leave. Get off my post. Don't bother.). He said that Trump has done some good things\u2014listing off things like Trump's plan to keep asylum seekers out of the US. Usually I can ignore this shit, but he kept going. He started talking about reverse racism before I cut him off. \n\nWe were the type of friends that would talk for a minimum of 2 hours a day, every day. We haven't talked since last Thursday. On Monday, at like 5 am after not going to bed, I sent him this text (it's long because it explains why I reacted the way I did):\n\n&gt;So, this is one of those things that I've been trying to put words to for the past few days. Between not knowing what I want and not having the words to say what I want, I've kinda been at a loss. So I'm gonna let my 4 am brain loose and see if I can slap my feelings down.\n\n&gt;I feel like I'm waiting. I don't know what I'm waiting for. It isn't an apology. I know I won't get one, I don't deserve one, and you don't owe one. So it isn't that. I thought that maybe I wanted you to \"fight harder\" or something for my friendship, but that isn't true either. You could text me 600 times or only 6, and I'd still probably ignore you. So what am I waiting for? Why do I feel like I'm holding my breath? I think I've figured it out: I've been waiting for this conversation. For one of us to start it. The \"why haven't I been talking to you and when will I start back up? Will I start back up?\" conversation. So, let me start it and probably finish it. All in one go.\n\n&gt;You probably know why I haven't been responding. The whole political dilemma. You said it yourself, after we talk politics I get weird and we don't talk for a bit. Thing is, I don't, and I can't, remember it happening before. This is me with my tired brain. When I'm half asleep, I have the most access to my memories. So when I say I don't have certain ones now, it's because they are gone. So one of two things has happened: (1) you lied or exaggerated or whatever and we never actually talk about politics, or (2) I pushed whatever views you had so deep down, so far back in my brain, that I will never have access to them again unless you retell me about them. I'm thinking 2 is more likely. And the only reason that 2 would even exist would be so I could stay friends with you. Whatever you believe in, that you told me, isn't bad enough in my brain to make us not be friends, but it is bad enough that me knowing would fuck up our friendship.\n\n&gt;So, why can I remember this? Why is this the only thing sticking? What has made this piece of information more important than the pieces before it? It's because this is the info that hits me closest to home. Whatever you've said before, maybe you've said it through ignorance, or just a different thought process. But this... This is something I can't forgive. I just can't. And please know, I'm not trying to change your mind. I know I won't. So don't go into this defensive. I'm not attacking you. I'm telling you what is happening in the most objective way I can manage. If you want to respond, and get all mad because I'm silencing you, or because I'm not following your train of thought, go for it. This is one of those things where we aren't going to change each other's minds.\n\n&gt;After I figured out what I wanted, I had to figure out how to explain it to you. This has been the biggest problem for me. 98% of my explanations involve relating my experience to one that you have. And I can't do that with this. Anything that makes you a minority, you can hide. \n\n&gt;You are going to grow up, not with a constant sense of wrongness in your skin because people insist on calling you a girl when you know you aren't.\n\n&gt;You are going to grow up, and you can fall in love with and marry a girl.\nYou are going to grow up, and not have to fear being shot because of your skin.\n\n&gt;You are going to grow up... \n\n&gt;I can't relate what I'm feeling to you because you can't relate. And I'm sure that is one reason you think the way you do. You are very lucky. You have a lot of privilege. And right now, if you are bristling at that suggestion, take a seat. Stand up and take another seat. Take several seats until you aren't feeling attacked by my statement. No, privilege isn't a bad thing. Yes, you do have it.\n\n&gt;You are white. No one is ever going to opress you because you are white.\n\n&gt;You are cis. You aren't going to face the gatekeeping that so many trans people do.\n\n&gt;You are able bodied. The only major medical issue you have is your [it's enough to be disqualified from the US military, but not enough to effect everyday life], but that isn't going to stop you from working.\n\n&gt;You are straight passing. Whatever you are, you are in a relationship with [his girlfriend], and you get into relationships with girls.\n\n&gt;You are a man. You aren't going to worry the way a woman has to regarding most social settings.\n\n&gt;There is so much more. It doesn't mean you are a bad person, it isn't me complaining to you. These are just facts. You are a cis, white, able-bodied, straight-passing, man from a well off family in America. You will never understand what it feels like to be on a street, in a sketchy neighborhood, scared for your life, because there are adult men cat calling you, while you are 14. You will never understand how hopeless it feels to be told that your body doesn't belong to you, that old people in power get to decide that it isn't yours. And you can't understand how crippling it is to learn that your best friend agrees with someone that thinks that you are less than human.\n\n&gt;And that's where my brain is now. That's what I need you to understand. It's the same with how I went on my 2 year rant [his girlfriend who is extremely pro-life, to an extent where she was calling people that get abortions murderers] about abortion. I have a personal stake in it. Through his policies, Trump has shown over and over that he doesn't think that AFAB (assigned female at birth) people deserve control over their bodies, he doesn't think that queer people deserve the same basic rights as other people (military ban, difficulty adopting for gay couples, healthcare with trans people, etc.), he doesn't think that racial minorities should be treated the same as white people (\"go back to your country\" with even non-immigrants), and on and on. There is just so much shit. And you can't even fucking relate. Which is why I can't properly explain it. If you have no way to walk in my shoes, then it's really hard for you to *actually* get where I'm coming from. And most of me is glad that you aren't going to go through this shit, but part of me almost wishes you would, just so you could get it. I'm not a woman, but I've lived as one, and I've been treated as one. I'm going to struggle to find a job or housing until I've managed to have surgery so I can change the rest of my info to not out myself. I've been told that I don't deserve to be in control of what happens to my body. I've been harassed at my doctor's office. I've dealt with shit at school, at government buildings, at medical appointments, in public, and in private. As much as it sucks for me, it means I can better empathize with people from other minority backgrounds. I can't ever understand the fear of being deported, because I'm not at risk, but I can understand the fear of being evicted, fired, and killed because of who I am, so I can understand where someone is coming from. It isn't the same thing by any means, but dealing withy own shit gives me a small look into other people dealing with heir own shit.\n\n&gt;And that's what is so frustrating about this. I can't ever make you understand why I feel how I do outside of a vague description. And I know this logically. But emotionally? This feels like one of the biggest betrayals. You're my best friend. For actual years now, you have been there for me. You have been the best you can be. You managed to gain my trust. I was to a poi t where I loved you. But this feels like the floor has dropped down to hell and I'm free falling down. Even if you've been vocal about it, I can't remember. So this is new in my scrawny brain. \n\n&gt;And even if you don't mean it like this, in my mind, if you are siding with this man, what does that mean about how you see me? Because I feel like it can't be good. \n\n&gt;I know you don't like trans people that make everything about their transness, but here you go. Most of this boils down to the fact that Trump would sooner see me dead and homeless than any other way. And now that I look back, I have to question all of your motives regarding everything you've said or sent to me. \n\n&gt;Right now, my transition is my life. I have to put so much effort into every fucking gesture. I don't leave my house because of it. I am scared to talk to people because of it. I have stopped making friends because of it. I have more nights than not where I have to cry because of how I feel about myself. But I'm not crying now.\n\n&gt;And that's what scares me. I don't know if I've gotten better at kicking people out of my life, or if there is just something really wrong with me, but Thursday night, I shut down. My feelings shut down. And I cut you out. I no longer have any attachments to you. You said you wouldn't end a friendship over something like this because you don't get how life or death something like this is. \n\n&gt;Like I've said, it isn't a difference of opinion, it is a difference in morals. I'm not going to change your mind. I'm not trying to. I just want you to maybe understand why I might not come back to our friendship. Although, I have doubts that you would even have me as a friend after this, because clearly I'm just trying to brainwash you as I make everything about the fact that I'm trans.\n\n&gt;Respond if you want, don't if you don't. Feel whatever emotion you want to feel at me. I'm sorry for not explaining myself sooner, and I'm sorry for ignoring you. If you don't answer me, I wish you the best in life. I hope you go far.\n\nBasically, I am now questioning a lot of the ignorant things that he has said (and I've ignored) in the past because they didn't seem relevant to me then. But this was all pretty final sounding on my part, I guess, because he hasn't responded. I don't know if he ever will. And I spent a while trying to understand why I wanted a message back. I don't regret the things I said. I meant them all. They are true in my eyes.\n\nI think I just want closure. I know he will never change his mind and think like me, and I know that more than likely, this will just make him mad, and will make him think that I'm silencing his \"opinions\". And I know I don't deserve closure. I was very final on my end, so he probably doesn't feel the need to reply. But I feel like I'm dying. Knowing that this is the last thing I said to him, that this is the last I will ever see of him (I moved about a year ago and he is one of 2 people I've kept in contact with), I hate myself. I don't doubt my my own views. I am still firmly rooted in them. And I don't think I could make a friendship work knowing that he would side with someone that would rather I was dead or in danger over me. But I hate myself. I loved this kid. He put so much effort into our friendship. He was one of the best things to ever happen to me. \n\nAnd I threw him away. \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with me?\n\nIt's been 2 days since I sent that message. I wish he would just give me anything to show that he has acknowledged what I said. Block me, unfriend me, message me, for God's sake, something! I know he didn't read it Monday (during the day) because he was busy. I have to assume he has read it since then since he stopped messaging outright on Tuesday. \n\nI hate myself.\n\nEverytime I have any type of happiness I go and destroy it. What's wrong with me. \n\nI don't know what I'm looking for here. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this. If you made it this far... Thanks? \n\nI'm going to wait until Monday, it will have been a week by then, and I could probably safely assume he won't be messaging back after, and I might unfriend him or leave all the group chats I'm in with him (idk, I think that I'm hoping he's just mad rn, and he'll message me back at some point). \n\nIf you have anything you want to say to me, go for it. If you want to be mean or rude, go for it. I deserve it at this point. \n\nThe thing that's weighing me down the most is I'm going to go back home (Michigan is 10 hours from where we moved to) in about 2 weeks, and I was going to see him. And if he doesn't message, if we don't resolve this, I really will never see him again.\n\nThis was all over the place, I'm sorry. \n\nTl;Dr\nMy (ex?)best friend and I had a political disagreement, the person he supports has put more than a few things against people like me in place, and I can't just be friends with someone that likes a person that would intentionally put me in harm's way. I blew up at him and said he didn't have to message back if he didn't want to, and it's been 2-3 days, and he hasn't messaged. I know it's my fault, but I stand by everything I said to him. How do I deal with the heartbreak of losing the person I loved most?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Yes, they had, but proceeded to tell me they didn't get around to telling me because they have anxiety, depression, are suicidal etc. A lot to take in, but as someone who has suffered from anxiety and depression in the past, I could relate and gave some reassuring advice.\n\nI felt bad for the kid. So I checked in a few times to see how they were handling things. Went well, but they started to become clingy. I gave my address out of kindness and, being a gen Z, they immediately Google Map'd me, showing me my own house. I got creeped out but chose to stay quiet. A few more conversations later, their clinginess persisted. If I stopped conversation mid way to prep stuff for Etsy: \"you stopped talking - did I do something wrong?\". I reassured them no, I was not mad, just packing.\n\nThis person would frequently bring up points negative about their life, they were bullied. They have no friends. They broke up with their partner. Talk got considerably worse, letting me know that they can't get a job. Any positive talk would turn negative and they would dump their problems on me. I'm not a therapist and since talk was getting darker, I suggested therapy only to be replied with: \"I haven't been to one, they don't want to help me at all\".\n\nAll I get is negativity from this person, and I don't see how this is an equal friendship. As I said earlier, I know what depression and anxiety are like, but I've sought help, and am no longer on meds.

At times I'm afraid to even say good morning to her. I have a cat that she's always telling me how much she hates my cat, she's mean to the cat, I hate it. But the thing is I like her, I honestly do, I just have felt so lonely and trapped and thought I would hate being social but then i realized I actually really like having people around,...but at home, I'm around the wrong people.

Growing up, she was a jealous friend and would drop out of any sport/lesson she was signed up for growing up and then complain that she was bored and had nothing to do while I was involved in sports/activities. She got mad any time I would talk to my other friends and her mom would call my mom and accuse me of \"leaving her out\" and I would get in trouble because my mom was way too nice and would make me apologize for being a kid existing in a group full of other kids, when really my mom should've learned to say \"piss off\" that's what I would've done at least, but I'm not as nice as my mom I guess. \n\n20 years later and we are still having these same issues. She has children and I do not, however I do get weird hours for work sometimes. We live about 40 minutes away from each other so our schedules are very different/hard to coordinate. \n\nI'll also add in probably the past two years after we'd hang out I would feel so drained that I would wait for weeks to hang out with her again cause it's just hours and hours of sitting at her house talking about the past and I'm just not really pumped to talk about our past for 6 hours each time we hang out. (And yes I would suggest going out to eat/bars/something outside of our homes but she didn't like spending money at restaurants and it was hard to get someone to watch her kids...so she claimed)\n\nThe last time we hung out was in February just after I got back from a trip visiting my college friend. It was so awkward cause you could see she was physically upset that I.....took a trip to see a friend I haven't seen in 5 years. She mentioned \"ugh, why haven't we taken a trip together?\"........idk maybe it's cause we live close to each other???? I tried avoiding talking about the trip but she kept asking about it and when I would answer she'd roll her eyes and say things like \"wow, I guess we have different ideas of fun....\"\n\nAfter that we would text other times to hang out and we'd set up something and two hours before she would cancel and then whine about the fact that we haven't hung out when she cancelled every time. This goes on for months. So she texts me asking if I want to see a movie that day when I already sent her my schedule that said I was working at that time. I just reply \"can't....working\" this is where shit hits the fan:\n\nShe asks me if I'm mad at her, I say I'm fine but I'm frustrated she keeps cancelling and then acting mad at me that we haven't hung out. She then goes into this whole thing where my responses haven't been good enough for her when she texts me that she's depressed (when I went through major depression myself at the same time). I apologize for my responses and explain to her I was also going through a really rough time and I shut myself off from everyone when I get that way and I also offer to hang out the next day cause I had that day off.  She decides to not text me back for 3 weeks so in my head I'm like.....okay??? I guess this is done? Cause she always texts back really fast. \n\nSo 3 weeks later I'm at work, walking outside, she's driving by, sees me, dramatically runs towards me and is crying and is saying \"I'm sorry, I was just mad at you\" I'm so shocked to see her that I'm just like \"it's okay!\" But in my head I'm like \"excuse me, fuck you....first of all\" we agree on a time to hang out but this time I cancel cause I literally almost puked thinking of hanging out with her I was so angry even thinking about her, I just couldn't let go of her saying \"I was just mad at you\" bitch wtf??? So seeing her face to face was not ideal for me at that time. \n\nA few more weeks go by and again she texts me if I want to go to a concert with her, I say im not interested so she texts again \"are you mad at me?\" I say \"these last few situations haven't sat well with me and it's been weird\" She asks me what's been weird...like nothing has happened at all. I explain to her everything she said to me and why it made me mad, this bitch literally brings up a fight we had in high school (12 years ago) and says this is the same thing I did to her in high school. \n\nWanna know what happened in high school? She got mad cause we were at a dance and I danced with people. Her mom called my mom and said I was a terrible friend. But she likes to angle it from her side where I started leaving her out because she had this like emo year or whatever. I still hung out with her when she was being emo....I feel so silly as a 27 year old typing out that sentence but here we are. \n\nI get so angry she thinks this is appropriate at all to bring up something from a decade ago and say \"oh were bringing up high school now???? Okay, no, I am not doing this\". She insists we meet in person and is like \"no we're going to talk about this, this is too important\" I'm like \"no, nope I am done, I am not going to sit here and argue with you about something from high school which is obviously something I completely misunderstood with the whole situation, but it's useless.... we will never agree on this\" again she's like \"I know it'll be uncomfortable but we have to meet up\" I say \"no we do not! I do not want to meet up with you, please leave me alone\"\n\nShe's left me alone but it's only been a week. I won't be surprised if she pops up out of nowhere again or texts me novels about how this is all my fault.I also realize this stuff probably shouldn't have been over text but honestly, it's been a very stressful friendship and I no longer feel like I need to stick around just because we've been friends for a long time. She has always controlled me and nothing can ever be her fault, and I am so done with it. I'm sticking to my guns of not reaching out to her, but I do think every once in a while \"oofffff that was probably not the best way to end a friendship\" but honestly it really feels like a weight has been lifted nonetheless.\n\nPS one of my closest friends just told me this. So this friend I'm not friends with anymore didn't show up to my wedding and messaged my other friend that she was the reason she didn't come to my wedding cause I was closer to her in college and she was jealous that she wasn't close with me in college.......  She also told me she got bullied by her and would say \"stay away from her, she's my friend\". \n\nSo I think it's safe to say I made the right choice. I wish I would've known this information earlier in my life though otherwise I would've chosen to not reconnect with her. In college we barely even spoke to each other but once I moved closer to her, we reconnected. Yikes yikes yikes all around. \n\nSorry for the novel and kudos to you for reading all of this.

As you can see from the title, I have a fair amount going on which makes socialising face to face pretty difficult for me. The friends irl I do have haven't been supportive as of late and I'm looking to connect with some like minded internet friends to be friends with long term. \n\nA bit about me then. I have high functioning autism (only found this out in march) which means that unless you know me very well, you wouldn't know I have autism but this makes socialising and life generally difficult which causes bouts of depression and anxiety so I'm not always a barrel of laughs sadly! But I hide it well and seem very 'normal' to anyone who doesn't live with me!\n\nI absolutely love true crime ( I know I'm such a basic white girl!), horror films, Alice in Wonderland and cats (the animals not the horrific new film that's coming out) and especially love my black cat Zepp (yes named after rock legends Led Zeppelin)! I also really love music and am mainly into indie and rock. I play guitar very badly too. I love to read, especially anything to do with horror, again true crime or criminology and sociology. \n\nI would like to find someone to chat to of a similar age if possible but other than that I dont mind where in the world you're from, what you do, what you like, gender, ethnicity, sexual preference etc anyone who is a kind and caring soul who wants a genuine friendship is welcome to DM me :)\n\nUpdate: Thanks so much to everyone who has messaged me!

I am originally from Socal so majority of my childhood and highschool friends are currently in South California. In highschool, we had a group of friends and in that group of friends, me and my friend (that I need advice on) would hang together the most. In high school, she had trouble communicating her feelings and it was difficult for her to have deep talks. I understood that I should respect that and if she didn't want to talk about it with anyone, I might as well be there for her as support. However, with the end of highschool, I moved to North California for study. Anytime something exciting happened to me or interesting happened, I would text her and my other friend in that group with my news. They would always be the first to hear of anything that happened in my life. The other girl in our group would do similarly. However, the friend (that I need advice on) would not do as much. Until, she met a boiii, and would constantly text us about him. This was the first time I saw her be able to express her feelings and actually have deep talks. I supported their relationship and cheered from the sidelines. At that same time, she was having family troubles and told everyone in the group about it except me. I hanged out with her at the time that it occurred but she never brought it up. Again I respected her decision and did't ask her about it (I heard about her troubles from my friends in our friend group). After, I went back to Northcal for school. I continued to update them with news and videochat with them. When my friend had broken up with the boiii she met, she first told us about it and I really wanted to comfort her despite being on the other side of California from her. I tried to tell her that she was amazing as a person and that there was nothing wrong with her, but she took it as \"nagging\". later on that month, she got back with him and told everyone in the group about it except me. We even videochatted but her bf problems never came up :( I am beginning to think that our friendship is more of a one-sided friendship where I thought we were best friends. We've been friends for a long time and I thought that she just had a problem with expressing her feelings and wanting to keep things personal, so thats why she never talked about things like her feelings or personal problems with me. But, I've learned that she just might not be comfortable with talking to me about her problems. What should I do? Should I distance myself from her? Should I keep being there for her?  I'm not sure how to approach her and what our relationship is. We are still in the friend group and we've been friends the longest in that group but I feel like she does not consider me the same way that I consider her.

We were both about a 2 hour walk away from our houses and we live around a 45 minute walk from each other\u2019s house. Me and one of the friends ( B ) live within 15 mins of each other and my best friend and our other friend ( J ) live within 10 mins of each other. F and J were going to get a taxi back to Fs house and me and B were going to have to make the two hour walk down to our houses. I asked F if me and B could get into his taxi and be dropped off midway between the party and Fs house. I didn\u2019t see how this could be a problem as it wouldn\u2019t cost any extra as the taxi would simply stop en route to Fs house but it would just make the walk shorter for me and B. When I asked this F starts to argue it and shout saying no and that it will cost more. When I try to explain that it won\u2019t he just keeps raising his voice and asking why I\u2019m trying to start and argument. I never wanted an argument so I just kept saying \u2018okay then fine it will cost more me and B will just walk\u2019, just to try and make him happy. He then decided for 5 minutes to shout personal insults at in front of many people at the party. I then retaliate by telling him to stop crying so he then asks me for a fight. I accept his \u2018offer\u2019 for the fight and say what are you going to do then. He then pushes me and starts shouting calling me a bitch because I won\u2019t fight back. I end it by just walking away with B and making the 2 hour walk home at 3am. The next day he apologises for what he said the night before and asks to end any beef. I agreed to end the beef and didn\u2019t tell him I was still angry at him and I just pretended it was all fine. Over the next few days after that I was pretty cold to him and wouldn\u2019t talk much to him at all. Earlier today he messaged me asking if there was a problem between me and him and I admitted that yeah there was a problem as I was still annoyed at what he had done. He then replied by saying it was provoked and that I was the one who started the fight and that J even knows I was the one who offered to fight him. I then messaged B and J who both told me that F was the one who offered the fight and not me so it is clear he is lying about that to try and justify his actions. Am I in the wrong for being cold to him after the argument, am I in the wrong for saying things such as stop crying during the argument, and what should I do about the whole situation?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We were practically inseparable. She was a pushover, I was assertive and would protect her from people. Over the years we would get so close she was considered family. Around fifth grade, we also became close with another person (18F)(Friend #2). While not as close sometimes, she was still my best friend just like friend #1\n\nThings have kind of changed... \n\n I first started noticing problems around three years ago and we had a bit of a falling out, but things returned to normal after a month break or so. I think the main cause of this was her developing anxiety, and me not understanding it. She would never talk to me about it, which hurt me in a way. We would tell each other everything, and suddenly she's hiding things. On top of this, she started getting closer to a childhood friend (we'll call her Lisa) who I always felt a little threatened by. I knew Friend #1 and I were best friends for life, so I wasn't tooooo worried.\n\nSenior year of high school, she dropped a bombshell on me. She told me she had feelings for Lisa. Not ONLY that, but that they had been talking. I asked when she knew, she said freshman year. Friend #2 already knew. For years. Original reaction: happy she told me. I was supportive of that at first, but after thinking about it for a while, some things hit me. She waited three fucking years to tell her closest friend that she was talking with another girl. What did she think I'd do? kick her to the curb? Friend #2 was already bi and I didn't care!!! That really fucking hurt that she didn't tell me for so long. Friend #2 consoled me and said it was torture keeping it from me, but she knew it wasn't her story to tell. She agreed with me and said it was cruel to keep it from me for so long. I expressed my hurt feelings to Friend #, and we resolved it. But keeping that kind of secret from me, who she called her closest friend, is the kind of wound that leaves a scar on the friendship.\n\nFast forward to now, summer after graduating high school. Friend #2 and I had a bunch of classes together and had a crazzzy great time. We ended up getting a lot closer on a different level than Friend #1 and I. I felt more alive, more fun, and just more fresh in general. We fed off each others energy in a different way. I felt like I could talk to Friend #2 about some things more than Friend #1.\n\nI don't know when it first started, but early in the summer I started getting increasingly annoyed with Friend #1. I don't know how to say this in a nice way, but she's just sort of.... dumb. She doesn't think with common sense and just says very idiotic things sometimes. Her sense of humor (which we used to share) seemed to stay stagnant and old, and even kind of cringy. She would do things that are my big-time pet peeves, but I didn't know how to tell her to stop without being unnecessarily critical of how she acted. I am more of a bold person who loves to do stupid shit, but she was always so timid and just really..... weak. I suppose all my least favorite things became more apparent as I couldn't recall the last time I had a good laugh with Friend #1. In comparison to Friend #2, our friendship was just dull now.\n\nI couldn't tell if I was just getting bitchier, or if Friend #1 was becoming more irritating/dumb. I ended up expressing my frustration to Friend #2 and she confirmed that Friend #1 seemed a little slower than she used to come across as.\n\nThe thing that annoys me the most is that after seeing all the flaws in Friend #1, she was absolutely adored by everyone she met. Excuse me for being super bitchy real quick, but I just couldn't see it anymore. I admit, I was jealous. I've always been one to say controversial things, I'm headstrong, and I don't apologize if I don't think I'm wrong. I was jealous that she was rich and had everything given to her, when my single mother works three damn jobs and I can't even see her. I was jealous that she had guys confess their love to her. I was jealous that she was talented. But most of all, I was jealous that she was likable, and I didn't even know why. Anyway, this is getting too long and I'm just ranting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFriend #1 went on a 12-day summer camp where she couldn't talk to me and I couldn't see her. It felt good, and that's the scariest thing I've ever thought. Even though I've bashed her quite a lot in this post, I'm scared of what life will feel like if I drift from her. We're going to the same college, but she's doing online. Will I seriously be okay if I just.... stop talking to the closest/first friend I've ever had? I've grown to dislike her personality, humor, and mannerisms. Is that something I can really overlook?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading.

We still keep in contact and she is a nice girl who I know means well, but the problem is she is INCREDIBLY self centered and really only talks about herself. It is exhausting to say the least. \n\nWhen we lived together I would come home after a ten hour day, and without even asking me how I was or waiting for me to put my shit down she would just start rambling to me about her day and all her random thoughts. Not even a \"how are you\" or \"are you in the mood to talk right now\".\nI also helped her through a few relationship breakdowns while we lived together and was always there to offer advice or listen. But when it's my turn to come to her with a problem it IMMEDIATELY gets turned into something about her and it makes me feel so incredibly invalidated and like the entire \"give and take\" aspect of the relationship is super fucking inbalanced. \nI have tried to talk to her about this too and she seems to listen but always slips back into the same response mode. \n\nFlash forward to yesterday. This is a small snippet that I feel sums up our relationship pretty well. I had to go to a gynaecologist specialist at the hospital yesterday because I have some abnormal cell growth that could potentially be cervical cancer. That's a pretty big deal to me and so is having a group of randoms poking around in your vagina. I expressed this to her and she responded with ONE sentence dedicated to me and what I am going through (\"that sucks, I hope it's nothing serious\"), no questions about how I was feeling or anything, and then a whole paragraph of things that are wrong with her and how she should probably go to the doctor too.... \n\nLike am I in the wrong for feeling like that is rude as fuck and super inconsiderate? This is our whole relationship and it does my head in. I still want to be her friend but I also don't know how to move forward with the relationship being like this. \nI feel like I am just being used for being \"an emotional rock\" and am not allowed to have any problems of my own or time to talk about them. \n\nAny advice in regards to this will be appreciated because I am unsure how to handle it, and she insists that she has high levels of empathy despite being ignorant to my feelings all the time. Ultimately we are still friends though and I do care about her and I know she cares about me too, she just has a weird way of showing it. Ugh.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I was the odd duck of the group. I\u2019m artsy and they are sporty. I grew up poor, they grew up rich. We always joked how I was the odd duck in the group and I loved them all dearly. \n\nIn our 20\u2019s, we were pretty close. They were all on a soccer team and drank beer after the game. I\u2019d go to the games and hang out but after a while it just wasn\u2019t my scene.\n\nThey all have houses, dogs, and married their first ever serious relationship. \n\nI\u2019ve rented, moved a lot and have had 4 serious bfs. I like cats. \n\nI\u2019m shy but I love people so I go out and meet people often. They are also shy but stick to the friend group. \n\nWhen I was 26, I went through an extremely hard break up. He wasn\u2019t a good partner. We lived together for 4 months after we broke up and it was awful. I was so depressed.\n\nMy friends never reached out to see how I was doing. I lost my cat in the break up and no one ever checked in. That always hurt. My ex always said they never cared about me and I think I started to see it. \n\nShortly after that I moved away and started to feel the drift. When I came to visit no one seemed to care. Id make plans to see everyone but it was more like a \u2018hi\u2019 than \u2018HEY!!!\u2019.  \n\nWe have a group chat. Whenever I posted in it no one really said much. Probably because they couldn\u2019t relate but they didn\u2019t make an effort To try, whereas I\u2019d check up on them about their home renovations and trips to Mexico etc. I ended up leaving the group chat on good terms but it was because I felt ignored by my friends constantly. \n\nBecause I was living in a new city, I felt so lonely. I\u2019ve never felt loneliness before. I had a lot of time to think. I felt like I was looking at the last 27 years of my life from the outside in. I realized my friends don\u2019t care about me because I was different. It was heartbreaking.\n\nThis process of drifting hurts a lot. They were my security blanket my whole life and now I\u2019m a stranger. I grew up in a distant family so they felt like my family. This has been going on for 2 years and some days it bugs me so much. \n\nI feel rejected. I\u2019m mad because I\u2019ve been there for them and had their backs always. And the events the last 2 years I just really needed a friend. I\u2019m scared to not have them as friends because I\u2019m afraid of being alone. I feel they haven\u2019t tried to stay in touch. I wrote them each a letter recently just saying I valued growing up with them and will always love them. I didn\u2019t hear anything back... ouch.\n\nA month ago I moved back. I moved in with my boyfriend. We have a great relationship and he\u2019s quite social. We are artsy and eccentric. I haven\u2019t spent a lot of time with them because I feel if they don\u2019t accept me then they definitely won\u2019t accept my boyfriend.\n\nIt\u2019s weird going through this process. I know it\u2019s natural and just part of growing up but it hurts when you\u2019re the one person in the group drifting. \n\nTBH I have nothing in common with them and I find their views quite conservative. They are very content with their simple lives and I think I\u2019m just not someone who fits in that simple life. They spend money on big houses just to use 1 room to watch Netflix all night. When they saw my new space they were confused why I didn\u2019t have a TV. \n\nI just miss the old days when I was the odd duck but we all still loved each other. I guess some relationships are circumstantial and this 25 year friendship has become that.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

So she came out, denied it, and the conversation turned into me spilling out everything she had \"done on me\" over the years. I offered her the same open forum to confront me, but she had nothing to say. On of the things she admitted to was stealing  money from me (when I had money!)  when I'd ask her to pick things up for me she lived in the centre of the city, and I'm way out in the Suburbs. Somewhere between 500-1000 worth over  year.  As it was 10-20e a week, I didn't notice for a while.She also has some worrying behaviours, like stealing from another friend  of hers and telling me about it, or manipulating (literally \"begging\" for something she likes and feels entitled to, and shoplifting. This is not a 2 way relationship, i'm her therapist, receptionist, barista, court attendee etc.When I was bringing my dead cat to be cremated, she begged to come to give me support, and was nearly an hour late and caused me so much stress on a day I was already heartbroken. I didn't ask her to my Mums funeral a few yrs ago as I felt I would have to \"mind\" her, and as an only child I just wanted to say bye to Mum without any unnecessary drama.\n\nThis happened 2017-2018. We had some really hard conversations yesterday as I said, but she was hit with so much behaviour  confrontation that I excused it, thinking, she'll offer to pay it back next time I see her.  I urged her to get treatment for her untreated issues/ mental health. \n\n2 weeks ago she was in my house and I mentioned I was going to sell my vape pen, she begged me for it saying she'd  give me the money...in 2 weeks. What flipped my switch is that she's neither offered to pay the large or small sum back, and is giving out about being \"broke\" (she doesn't work) but is on buying sites today trying to buy a camera!\n\nDo you guys have any advice for me? Should I just call it quits? If I stole cash from a friend, and the were decent enough to give me a year to pay it back, i'd wash their feet with my tears.However, I feel she has a big attitude because I asked for it back. I think she was shocked that I stood up for myself also!\n\nDo you think she should pay back the say, 500e? Help!!!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We bonded over a fantasy book series, got inspired, encouraged each other, talked all the time, made mini trips together, and I lost 20 lbs and she lost 40 lbs in one awesome year.  It all culminated in a trip to Ireland.  After we got back, she separated from her husband and started hooking up with a guy that everyone in her group said was bad news.  I got pregnant with my second child after the trip.  The year after our trip, she was in emotional turmoil with this guy, they both cheated on each other, he asked her not to tell me he borrowed money (before I even met him), and when she introduced me to him, she told me not to be offended if he commented on my (pregnant) boobs.  She missed my second baby \u201csprinkle\u201d because he did not trust her traveling.  They broke up and she told me all this bad stuff about him, I agreed that she could do much better, then, they got back together and she had him move in with her because his roommate kicked him out.  They seem to be doing OK now, but she said they still fight a lot and she drinks a lot more now compared to the past ten years I have known her.\n\nSigh.  So, here we are this year, and I am really just in mourning over the fun, enthusiastic person she was.  She doesn\u2019t read any more, she is not fired up about any fitness goals, and we have both talked about how depressed she sounds (for about the past 6 months).  She said she doesnt want to be a parent any more (she has two girls, I have two girls), so we don\u2019t talk about that.  Yesterday, I point blank asked her what she is doing for fun without this guy...because we had nothing to talk about on the phone yesterday.  She had no answer.  She said \u201cwork\u201d.  \n\nI don\u2019t have many close friends (INTJ) and this one really \u201cgot me\u201d and we HAD similar interests.

Martha knows my boyfriend and they get along well.

My friends and I went out to a bar and fairly early on in the night, another friend of mine (Meg) starts getting hit on by this tall dude. Martha goes quiet for a few minutes while the rest of us chat, then eventually storms off tearfully. I walked over to her as she was trying to leave and asked her what was going on. She cried and almost started yelling about how Meg was getting hit on. \u201cAm I too ugly is that the problem? Literally like no one ever wants me it\u2019s always you guys\u201d \nThis shit was F R U S T R A T I N G\nI told her that being hit on by overly drunk horny boys at a bar is nothing to write home about. But this energy and tears continued throughout the night and I about lost it.\n\nI know this is long, but she\u2019s obviously so insecure with herself to the point where it\u2019s effecting our friendship. \nI\u2019ve listened to her, talked things through about 15 different guys with her, boosted her up, I don\u2019t know what else there is to do.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I'm sorry if this posts ends up being too long but I really hope someone out there can give me insight/advice. \n\nBackground:\nKristy and I have been friends for 8 years and best friends for 3. Kristy and Judy have been friends for like 12 years. A little over a year ago I met Judy through Kristy, and we became friends. Judy and I aren't super close but we talk regularly (usually in a groupchat with 2 other friends) and I see her more often than Kristy because we live in the same area (Kristy is in a diff part of the state - this is also the only reason Kristy isn't in the groupchat).\n\nKristy has another friend, Hannah, who I don't like because I've only ever heard complaints and bad things about her from Kristy. \n\nThe drama:\nKristy and Judy were hanging out, when Judy texted our groupchat \"Kristy is facetiming your BFF Hannah lmaooo.\" She was obviously joking around and trolling me since she knew I didn't like her. I started complaining to Judy that I don't understand why Kristy remains friends with Hannah. It was supposed to come from a place of concern that she's friends with someone she doesn't really seem to like. But I was drunk at the time, and I dramatically and jokingly called Kristy fake (when I'm drunk I use vocabulary like \"you dumb ass bitch\" but don't actually mean it. Maybe that's a bad thing but it's something to focus on another day lol). So Hannah and I continued talking bc we both feel like Kristy doesn't truly like Hannah and we don't understand it. Btw- this is the first time Judy and I have ever talked about Kristy, and we weren't even talking shit. \n\nKristy found out about our discussion and is extremely upset with us. She told me she no longer wants to be friends with either me or Judy. She said we'd broken her trust by \"talking shit\", disrespected her and her boundaries, and said there's no point of discussing her friendship with Hannah with a third party.\n\nI repeatedly and genuinely apologized for hurting her because of course I never meant to. I also told her I'd vented that I don't understand her friendship with Hannah (which I have told her personally many times). I said I don't view this as the same thing as talking shit, because we never said anything bad about her character and we didn't have any malicious intent. I also explained that it started as a dumb joke, and apologized that it went in a direction it probably shouldn't have. I don't think she really believes any of it, but I guess I can't blame her since she's so upset and hurt. \n\nBut, also, some of what she said is hypocritical to me. She has shared information about Hannah with me, a third party. She's also talked actual shit to me about Judy (like, ragging on her character and her as a person). So, why does she share these things with me if she's so against people talking about someone's problems with a third party?! Does it only apply when it's about her? Is it different because she and I are closer than she is to the other two?\n\nDuring our argument, Kristy even admitted that venting about friends is super normal, and she said \"as friends we rarely focus on the discussing the good unfortunately, and we vent and complain about people.\" But she firmly believes this situation was different. I don't really agree, but I'm trying to reflect on it and figure out if she's right and I'm wrong. Idk. \n\nA couple days later, Kristy implied she could work things out with me, but explicitly said she wouldn't be able to be my friend if I stay friends with Judy. It felt like an ultimatum. I told her I'd think about it and we haven't talked since then, which was two nights ago.\n\nI've told her I understand why she is hurt, and I've apologized profusely for hurting her and for not handling the situation the way she would've wanted/expected me to. I feel I have expressed genuine regret and admitted where I was wrong. \n\nThe situation now &amp; my current thoughts:\nI've been thinking about it for a couple days and now I understand that to her it's not an ultimatum, but actually a boundary. However, her boundary makes me uncomfortable because 1) it's an ultimatum from my point of view, 2) I don't want to be told who I can talk to, and 3) I don't want it to be a conditional friendship. So I feel like her boundary kind of violates my boundary. Plus I'm capable of maintaining two separate friendships.\n\nAm I totally in the wrong and am I being a shitty friend?

I'm a 25 year old gay dude from the west coast, just looking to get to know some new people.\n\nI enjoy cooking, programming, 3D modeling/rendering, tinkering, cannabis, fitness, and all things nerdy. C# is my language of choice lately, and I spend a lot of time messing around in Unity. I have a lot of random niche interests like procedural generation and earth science. Also, I'm studying for a networking certification.\n\nI don't play games as much as I used to - these days I'm more interested in studying and building them - but I'd be down to play pretty much anything multiplayer. Once in a while I still play Minecraft or the Dark Souls games. I'm also trying to decide between Guild Wars 2 and Elder Scrolls Online for an MMO.\n\nI'm very fond of all things fantasy, scifi, and horror, although I'm not much of a TV/film/anime person these days (JoJo is a guilty pleasure, haha). I listen to mostly rap and metal, but I'm open minded and have really broad tastes, it just depends on my mood and the weather and everything. I only recently started using Spotify, but I'd love to compare playlists if you're on it too.\n\nSide note, I'm going through a bit of a rough time lately, basically starting from scratch but remaining positive. Focusing on improving myself....Spending a lot of time on fitness and hobbies. I'm always down to discuss either heavy life stuff, or casual lightheaded subjects. I enjoy being supportive and giving advice as well as just chatting; ideally you're also someone who is conversationally flexible like that.\n\nBonus points if you're technical/scientific minded and/or LGBTQ+ friendly, although neither of those are a big deal! We'll likely get along as long as you're generally chill, so get in touch.\n\nI prefer to chat on Discord, but I'm open to other apps as well, I suppose.\n\nPS, if you think you recognize me, hit me up! I'm sure I'd love to catch up.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

my summer has gotten very dull when it comes to talking to people, i have no real life friendships and no one who will genuinely really want to do anything with me at all. i also have a friend who i really care about (and still do) who has texted me a lot less (it's a whole ass situation that you can read on my profile after this).\n* i need someone who doesn't care and doesn't mind how much i ramble an how much i may vent because i can go on really long tangents a lot of the time (as you can tell by this post). side note about this: i often can't think straight so i can send multiple messages at a time, which gets really spammy.\n* just a real, genuine friendship, with no filters or judgment. i won't judge you, you don't judge me because we are all on this planet for an undetermined reason, and we are where we are now for different reasons. every time you pass a car on the street or pass someone walking down the street on a Saturday morning, there is someone there who has a story to tell, there's a story there that's been in development for how long they've been alive. i've got a story and you've got a story, and there's no room for judging what's in the past.\n* i want to help you with your problems, too. i've been around a lot and i've met a lot of people who have had different experiences in their lives. i support all kinds of situations people are in be it anxiety, depression, eating disorders, past gang violence issues, teen moms, lgbtq+ people, and more. literally we're all people, and that's what it all comes down to. you're human, and i'm human and we all deserve to be treated like humans.\n* if you message me after reading this post, please be somewhere around **16-20 years old**, i don't really feel comfortable talking to that many people who are much older than me, i usually cut it there at 20 for right now, might make some exceptions depending on if you actually need me.\n\nthat should do it for deep shit, what am i like and what are my interests?\n\n* what am i like  \n\n   * i'm a redhead, soon-to-be senior in high school, so i talk about some problems at school sometimes\n   * i'm anti-social in real life and i mentally recharge when i'm by myself and taking to online friends, so i will guaranteed start conversations with you, but i ask that you please start some with me as well.\n   * i really like to voice call and facetime so if you're okay with that i may ask to do that a lot\n   * one thing to note is that i'm clingy but only because i make a friend and i like to hold onto that friend tightly. it's super rare that i actually find someone like this so this one is obviously not a must and in fact some people are really just super annoyed with clingy people so i'm adding this in for them so i don't waste their time.\n   * i am kinda paranoid now simply because people in real life have given me super bad trust issues by playing with me and hurting me and thinking it's fun/funny.\n   * don't do drugs or alcohol and never will, i don't encourage it either, in fact discourage it so just don't even bring it up with me cause tbh i don't think it's cool. HOWEVER, i get why people do it. i just strongly disagree with the use of drugs and alcohol at a younger age.\n* what are my interests?  \n\n   * first off, i am a musician (guitar player), and i've had many achievements playing guitar, like an official recognition in downbeat magazine (international), a small 7-city 5-state tour around the US with a band I'm in (not as cool as it sounds) and my personal favorite, I played guitar on stage with Foo Fighters when they came through my home town last year.\n   * I am a lover of music as mentioned with the musician comment, so I will mention some of my favorite bands and artists here: Pearl Jam, Green Day, Foo Fighters, Guns N' Roses, the Beatles, Elton John, AC/DC, SWMRS, the Struts, the Interrupters, Ed Sheeran, The Killers, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, and any other rock acts like that. My first concert was Big Time Rush (threw that in there to make you laugh and the best part is is that it's true and i've got the t-shirt to prove)\n   * I LOVE roller coasters, I'm a roller coaster enthusiast. I watch roller coaster videos for fun, and I travel the country riding them. I've ridden 155 different roller coasters all around the country, chances are I've been near you if you live in the US.\n   * I play minecraft on mac (so the java version) and that's about the only popular video game i play. however as of the time of this post going up i've been locked out of my account and i dont know what's going on so i might not have minecraft anymore. i will not spend anymore money on video games, so if you want me to play something with you that costs money, then i'm sorry. i dont have any consoles, those all now belong to my brother and are with him in his apartment.\n   * i am a traveler and i love traveling and exploring, there's a chance i've been where you live if you live in the us. i often do some things with the outdoors like hike, kayak, canoe, camp, sometimes backpack.\n   * i dont play many sports, i'll go play disc golf recreationally every once in a while so there's that.\n   * i think that's it!\n\nif any of this interests you, please do not hesitate to shoot me a chat, message, anything that works for you! i've got snap, insta, and discord for those of you who want to begin messaging me! i'm sorry for wasting your time with this obnoxiously long post. i'll see you in the messages! if you dont want to message me, leave a comment and probably tell me why not, i won't be offended. but if this is the first/last time you hear from me, i hope you live a long and fantastic life filled with success and love. thanks again for reading!\n\n\\- David", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

So the lead up to all this was basically me deciding to leave the country where I currently live and moving to another country to do my military service. I'll name the country I live in 'Country A' and and the country I am moving to 'Country B', for simplicity reasons. I didn't decide over night, this was rather a series of events which made me consider the move even more. One of which was my, now former best friend after close to 6 years of being very close. I'd do anything for her, in fact I even used to have a very strong emotional attachment to her (love was in the air back then). She was one of the first people outside of my family whom I told that I was moving and I'd like to spend the most of my remaining time in the country. First she was fine, we hung out a couple times, then, all out the sudden, dead fucking silence. Fast forward two months, she starts making accusations about how I didn't care about her and I completely excluded her from my life. Which was not the case, I still asked her out on an almost daily basis, but she'd rather go out with her clique and get wasted. I continued to ask her out. Until a few days ago weeks ago (roughly the first days of July) when she told me how nothing came from me about asking her out and bla bla. So she texted me a couple days ago about how she will not be friends with me when I move and how I don't even need to try to contact her. Couple days later, she wants to see me. I went there. I mean, what can possibly go wrong amirite? She starts rambling about how she can't just cut me off, next thing she says is how I have to find a solution how to spend our last days 'together'. That moment I knew right away, I have to let her go. Cause in my book, I'd you're best friends with someone, you never ever fucking make demands, it's a give and take. She told me how she would regret it if she didn't meet up with me. Damn straight. And how I would run away from my past and my problems, whatever they may be, I'm perfectly fine with myself. And I told her years before I even considered moving, that I will never put anything or anyone between me and my dreams and goals. And being a soldier was my childhood dream. And I'm literally steps away from it. And if I had to decide again, I'd still stick with my decision. I'm not doing this for anyone else. Not my parents, not my friends, nobody. I'm doing this for myself. This is my gig. This is my fight. I'm basically doing a fresh start. And I don't care if she's 'cool' with it or not or how she's happy about me doing it. I know her. And I definitely know when she's lying. I know it hurts her. But I'm in the same situation. I mean, I'm leaving behind pretty much everything I have here just to start over. To achieve my goals. To fulfill my dreams.\n\n\n\nThank you to everyone who actually read this. Stay strong, shoot straight and pick your friends carefully. Separate the wheat from the chaff.\n\nI'm moving today, in about 19 hours I'm boarding the bus to the airport and am hour from then I'm boarding the plane. 5 hours later, it's hour zero.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

This community was suggested to me by a random whim and I got really excited at the prospect of having a second chance at human connection. I don't have friends- only (very) distant aquaintances.  I have a wonderful girlfriend who I love and get a lot of my social interaction from. (She and I have acknowledged and are making the effort to expand our social circles to reach a healthier balance in our lives... being in college is tough.....)\n\nAfter lurking for a few days here I decided to take a chance because Im going through a hard emotional period right now. My partner recently lost a close family member who was of similar age to us.  I have never experienced death before and although I am not in mourning or grief from this tragedy I am experiencing it through my partner. On the second day of having heard the news, I could just see it in her eyes that she might not ever fully be the same person anymore. Im sad and scared to say the least. I will be there for her for as long as she needs. With that said, Im, needing to build some emotional support for myself, find some people who I can just have fun with through conversation because of I can not and do not expect my partner to be able to accommodate those needs for me right now.\n\nSo if you feel like chatting at all feel free to message me.

I\u2019m interested in learning new things, but I have a  hard time motivating myself sometimes. I miss having interesting  conversations to be honest. An interesting conversation need not be  serious either! I have a soft spot for the humanities and the social  sciences. I do love science in general though. I\u2019d say biology is my  strong point in the \u2018hard\u2019 science category. I also love robotics!! I\u2019d  love to talk about AI ethics all day long, or just ethics in science in  general! I think that\u2019d be my dream job!\n\nI\u2019m  also kind of a fangirl. I know that has such a negative connotation  though. I just mean I enjoy fandom things and media. I used to roleplay  fandom things a lot, so if you\u2019re a former rper I\u2019d love to talk! Or  even a current one! I also did genres outside of fandoms! I miss having  fandom pals. I recently got big into Firefly (sooo late!) so I\u2019d love to  talk about that! Is Serenity generally considered a good ending to the  series?

I turned to my friends and they all were supportive of whatever decision I made about my relationship with a few encouraging me to leave what they saw as a toxic relationship. Fast forward to the end of June, I got bedbugs \u2014 which are being passed around within the extended friend group and I\u2019m almost positive they came from one of my close friends (let\u2019s call her friend B) that are now abandoning me. Friend B invited me over with the promise that I would make sure I was big free so she wouldn\u2019t get bed bugs again but she ended up finding a bug that night and got upset with me. I apologized and we came to an understanding. Well my other close friend (friend A) found out I took a big to Friend B\u2019s place and rejected any offer to hangout \u2014 which I completely understand \u2014 but now everyone has stopped contacting me fully really. I am now bedbug free and want to get out of my apartment to see real people for the first time in a month, but everyone is still leaving me in the wind. With my SO back from study abroad, I am feeling very lonely and the lack of emotional support from my friends is making it difficult to leave my toxic relationship. I guess I just don\u2019t know what to do to make them see that their actions are hurting me and making me feel broken in a lot of ways. Do I just dump them and move on or try and rekindle the friendships?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019m a great listener and I often find people opening up to me. From friends, classmates, coworkers, family members and people I encounter at my job. Age does not seem to be a factor, I\u2019ve spoke to people who are my junior and my senior. I\u2019m not sure why this happens, but I enjoy being a listening ear and talking to others. \n\n\nI\u2019m not one to judge others as it\u2019s not my right to do so. I can sometimes give my 2 cents about whatever we might be talking about. I can also sometimes be very straightforward with you and I won\u2019t sugar coat things. \n\nI believe that everything happens for a reason. There is a time for everything. We never know what someone else is going through, and a simple \u201chi\u201d \u201chave a good day\u201d \u201chow\u2019s you\u2019re day\u201d Can really make a big difference is someone\u2019s day. A small act of kindness doesn\u2019t cost a thing.  \n\nSometimes we must go through a process by ourselves or with others. Regardless of our situation in life we must remember that everything begins with US first. YOU have what it takes to make a change, and start that growing process in THAT area of your life. \n\nI want to be here for those who might have something they want to get off their chest. Those who just want someone to speak to and that won\u2019t judge them. I can do that. If you want me to say something and put my 2cents in.... I will, if you just want me to listen to you.. I will. \n\nI believe communication is important, for any sort of relationship. Having good communication sets a solid foundation. If you want to build something you always need a good solid foundation or else that which you build will fall. Things can sometimes be misinterpreted through text and I\u2019ve seen it happen many times. That being said I\u2019m okay with messaging on here, kik, or Snapchat maybe even WhatsApp. But I usually prefer some sort of voice call but only if we\u2019re both comfortable with that. \n\nPlease feel free to message me. We can talk about anything and also feel free to ask me questions. I apologize for any grammar errors but it\u2019s really late and I just wanted to post this.

To be up-front as well, I haven't been in the best place and I'm looking to distract myself. \n\nSo what am I into? Music is my thing. I love everything about music and don't discriminate with genres. If I like it, I like it. I also make music and that's my biggest time-sink; But you know the whole thing of \"hating what you make because you spend so much time making it so you know every flaw\"? Yeah, that's me. Honestly, I just love all forms of art, I dig deep into that stuff. Video games also, that's where I used to waste most of my time in before music. I can rarely make time for it, but I still love keeping up-to-date and discussing it. I'm also big into horror, from the real creepy stuff to the goofy campfire readings about haunted pokemon cartridges. Love, love, love it. \n\nOH OH! This is the part where people will hate me (even more). I'm hardcore K-Pop trash. So if you need someone to be trash with, hit me up. Mainly a girl group stan though, but I mess with some of the boys. \n\nI also speak two languages, Spanish is my native, but I feel much more comfortable with English, but we can speak whichever just fine. I'm currently studying Korean and I know *some* Japanese. And by some, I mean, its as much as someone who studied it in high-school for two months tryna remember it when they're 40. My Korean is much better (not that much), but I'm still not super confident about speaking it. \n\nBut if for some reason this caught your interest, I'm here so send me a private DM and I'll reply to that as soon as I peep it.

This past year we\u2019ve barely seen each other (we had lunch together, but she usually skipped lunch to study or finish her sculptures in pottery and we didn\u2019t have any classes together). Now that it\u2019s summer, I thought we\u2019d have more time to hang out, but she\u2019s always hanging out with her boyfriend (they\u2019ve been dating for the past year). She\u2019s blown me off a lot this past year to hang out with him, and even on the few occasions us two hang out, he calls and she ends up talking to him for 25 minutes while I sit there. On one occasion, she had been shadowing at a vet clinic for the day, and I texted her if she wanted to hang out. She replied with I get out at 5:30, maybe we can hang out then. Around 4 that day, I took my dog for a walk (I usually take a specific route that I know is a mile). My route takes me near the boyfriend\u2019s house (I used this route even before they started dating). As I was walking by, I saw her car parked outside of his house. So my friend lied about what time she got out of the vet clinic to go hang out with her boyfriend. At 5:30, she didn\u2019t text me but said hey a few hours later. I was kinda upset and didn\u2019t reply. The next week, we spent the day together on Thursday (the first time in a while), and I texted her on Saturday to see if she wanted to get lunch or something. She said she already had plans with her friend Claire.

I in no way want that to sound arrogant but that was just what people would say, probably because I'm not very serious and just goof around but knew my limits.\n \n Anyway thought school I've been close with a lot of different people but usually had 3 of us who were always super close, let's call them friend 1#  and friend #2. There is a huge story to all of this that I may go into if requested but for now I'll say that after a solid 4 year close friendship, friend 1# became really toxic and controlling of me so I cut him off. Ever since then I've been happy I cut him off as my life has seemed to have increased in quality. But that was about a year ago now, and friend 2#, who's supposed to be my best friend is now doing all these other activities with his \"cool mates\" and is even still doing shit with friend 1# who we had both agreed we hate. I always knew #2 was a bit of a pushover when I came to opinions but that's sort of what I liked about him because it meant he used to like everything I did so we'd have plenty to do together.\n\nAt school we were Also part of a bigger friendship group (me and friend 2#) and we would enjoy hanging out with them as they are more down to earth than the cooler kids and are just more like real people than the kids who are cool for playing football and going to parties or whatever. Anyway we were all close in this group but then we started to see a divide between us (me, friend 2# and about 2 others) and the more original members of the group if you will. Throughout the summer they have been organising and going to things with each other that us who were sort of pushed out of the group have been excluded from. \n\nThe issue I'm having is that I think the group think that I'm still super close with friend 2# and do loads of shit with him and his friends whereas he thinks I'm doing shit with the group so neither will invite me to things. Id hate to say anything because I feel like if they would then include me it would be more forced and awkward.\n\nWhat's more is my girlfriend now has been my closest friend outside of any of these group for years. Long story short but I helped her with eating disorders and possible suicides, for the last 2 year's she's been recovering and we've been dating for a few months now.\n\n she's the only person I now really talk to which is great for me and her but I'd hate to be somone who is just wrapped up in their relationship and has no time for friends. I'm no5 sure what I want but I know I should probably leave friend 2# and not bother anymore with him but Idk about the others.\n\nShould I try and slide back into that group or should I try and find other friends online (that's been a sort of dream of mine for a while But I've never know how to do it)\n\nThank you for reading, I know it's messy and confusing but I hope the message came across.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We have had a long history (the leaders) and have come away with several relationships that have lasted a long time. Most of us just chat when we have time and want to talk, and we talk about various things. Some subjects that come to mind: banter, our daily lives, politics, and real world stuff in general. We are all very diverse of interest, and all of us are active (we remove inactive people, who don't invest time.) I would say we have a good split of US and EU people, as well as a nice spot of Australians/SEA , and also Men/Woman ratio.\n\nWhat we're looking for is genuine people, who want to make long lasting friendships. The type of person who comes in to the chat and interacts with us, not just posts a meme and leave. If you're shy, socially awkward, we get it. We will allow you time to open up, and none of us are very judge-y. If you're coming in to this community, get ready to explore a world of genuine people with real thoughts and feelings, this is not a meme fest, although it can be. We have several channels and topics of discussions going on, and we're quite active as a rule - politics, not safe, selfies, introductions etc. Introducing yourself and showing yourself are highly encouraged, though not mandatory.\n\nIdeally you will be:\n\n\\- Honest (I do not want meme personalities or personas here. If you have crippling depression we get it, but be yourself.)\n\n\\- Interactive\n\n\\- Willing to voice chat sometimes or be very text-active\n\n\\- Authentic\n\n\\- Be looking for real friends from real people\n\nPS: If you only play games, it's likely not a great fit - this is a \\*social community\\* where you talk and make friends. This being said - we will have a dedicated minecraft server in the future, though this is not a focus. We also play Jackbox, CAH and Stardew Valley.\n\nPlease DM me with a blurb about you so I don't have to search your entire Reddit history to discover anything about you, thanks!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I'm on the autism spectrum and as such, that makes me pretty different from most people.

I don't care who you are or where you are from, just be a kind individual.   On my end, beyond being an oddball, I am very down to earth, somewhat witty and definitely genuine.

{"post_id": "cinxiv", "created_utc": 1564266672, "title": "How to get over a friend break-up", "author": "Laurenbugs", "self_text": "Tl;dr: (though the full story is, I think, important) I have a friend who I have had to cut out of my life because they were toxic for my mental health, but 'breaking up' with them is harder than I thought it would be. How do I get over it, and stop it from wreaking havoc on my mental health?\n\nSo I have this friend who I've been friends with for 10 years... since high school. Over the last year and a half now I've been running into issues where things she's been doing has made me feel like she doesn't care about me, just the idea of our friendship, and I've been concerned for her well-being as well. I knew that if I never reached out to her to talk about these things, that I would get resentful and start to ghost her-- to be honest I was basically already to that point.\n\nSo I sent her a message telling her that I had some things I wanted to talk to her about. I moved across the country from her 3 years ago and one of the things that really bugged me is that she was constantly nagging me to come visit her. Meanwhile I had visited her a dozen times in that 3 years-- including going back twice as her maid of honor and spending more than a thousand dollars between buying stuff for the wedding and the plane tickets themselves. And she hadn't visited me a single time, always because she \"doesn't have the money because she's going to school\" as if I have not also been going to school making minimum wage at a part time job.\n\nIn addition, she was always asking me to move back, never asking--maybe never caring-- that I'm  the happiest I ever have been. I have a partner who I'm incredibly happy with, I'm he most successful in school I ever have been, and I just overall enjoy both where I'm working and what my social life looks like.\n \nSo everytime she responded to my messages or reached out she was so drunk she couldn't remember the conversation while we were having it because during an hour long conversation we would rotate through the same 3 things every 10 to 15 minutes: her: \"come visit me\" me:-I can't, I have no money. Her: \"move back here\" me: I'm happy here, and my partner is happy here. Her: \"guess what new thing is happening in my life\" and repeat.\n\nI brought these things up to her-- in a less callous, yet lengthier way-- and told her I didn't want the friendship to end. But that I needed to tall about these things because I was beginning to grow resentful and I didn't want that. She responded with basically \"I don't have time t go through all of that right now but I will get back to you\" and then I didnt hear from her for a week and a half at which point I-- thinking, maybe she forgot about it-- sent her a message saying \"hey, hope you're doing okay, just reaching out because I was serious that I wanted to work this stuff out. I hope to hear from you soon\" and she just never responded. This was 4 months ago now, and I recently sent her a message telling her that she really hurt me. And asked her why she didnt ever respond to me. And, thank you facebook, I can see that she has seen it, she just isn't answering.\n\nSo my question is, how do I get over this friendship that is clearly so bad for me? She is someone I considered to be my best friend-- I was maid of honor at her wedding not even a year ago-- yet I don't seem to actually be that important to her. I am pissed at her, and I don't want to reform a friendship because it's clearly so toxic, yet I've been trying to get over it for months and cannot.\n\nHave you had friend break-ups like this? Where you dont want to end the friendship but you have to do it for your own mental health? How do you get past it? Since the person I would normally rage about it to is the person I'm 'breaking up' with I feel alone.

He was amazing and we used to hang out almost everyday growing up. I was the first person he came out to as queer and I considered that incredibly special and kept his secret. He was kind, caring, and compassionate to everyone he met. \n\nThings seemed to change when I moved to another city. I was the only one keeping up the phone calls and texts it seemed. I figured he was just busy with school. \n\nWhen I met my now husband things REALLY CHANGED. My boyfriend at the time was ready to meet my friends. We played games. My friend ended up poking my face with his foot as a joke and in turn I squeezed a bottle of water in his face (terrible I know). In a rage, my friend grabbed me by the hair and turned a knife at me. I was so embarrassed that the night had ended so badly. My best friend decided to ignore all of my texts and phone calls apologizing. He told my sister that \u201che was ignoring me because I needed to learn my lesson\u201d. In the end, it took my sister coaxing him to speak to me and we both apologized.\n\nFast forward to my husband and I agreeing to meet my best friend at the park for his favorite movie. He ditched us and did not pick up any of my texts or phone calls. I was incredibly worried about him all night. The park was only 5 minutes away for my friend while it was 40 minutes away in rush hour traffic for my husband and I. At about 11, I got a text from him angrily telling me that he didn\u2019t come because I had not texted him much before the event though we had agreed to meet there beforehand. He sent very nasty texts saying that I always played \u201cthe victim\u201d and that he blamed me for scratching his new car (as he was pulling out of his garage later to come to the movie but decided to stay home) and that if he wasn\u2019t so angry at me, it wouldn\u2019t have happened. I called him crying, saying I was sorry. I told my best friend that we\u2019d forget it forever though I never forgot and felt like I\u2019d been wronged.\n\nAnd just last night I had my best friend and sister over. He drank WAY TOO MUCH and kept calling my sister and I \u201cbitches\u201d all night for various reasons. One being that I wouldn\u2019t play a certain song. He pushed my sixth month old puppy off the couch violently, played his phone obnoxiously loud when music was already playing from mine, and called my husband \u201ca pussy\u201d. This is when I got PISSED. I told him NOT to call my husband (who puts up with him without complaint) a pussy. Then I told him to go to bed before he made me angrier and I would say something I would regret. He called me mean and laughed. My husband and I went to bed and locked our door.\n\nThis is where you\u2019d think it would end right? Nope. My friend has a handicap parking pass in his car because he had a condition when he was younger. He is perfectly, physically fine now. He STILL parks in wheelchair spots. Today I told him that we shouldn\u2019t park there. My husband agreed. My best friend waved us off with \u201cI\u2019m handicapped and the spot is mine now anyways\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve given this friend my old job when he was fresh out of college and he wanted to ask for a 5-8k raise immediately. He never said thank you to me.\n\nHe constantly interrupts me when I\u2019m talking and never notices. \n\nI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever shared this with anyone except for my husband. I\u2019ve never parted from a best friend (I\u2019m not very good at making long lasting friendships anyways) and I know that parting would break his heart. He still considers me his very best friend and always questions me why we don\u2019t hang out more often. Sometimes I have a good time with him but lately it seems like the rare occasions we hang out, all he wants to do is drink and get ass backwards drunk. I\u2019m a bit afraid to communicate this to him because I think he\u2019ll explode over it.\n My friend DOES have plans of moving to another state someday. Should I let it fizzle out then? I\u2019m not sure what to do.\n\nAlso if you read this, thanks SO MUCH. It really helped just to air this out.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nI just recently graduated from college with a degree in film mostly focusing on editing. I suffer from both anxiety and depression.

I have a hard time making conversation so I might be boring to talk to. I will try my best. I don't have much in my life but I just recently found an internship sort of. \n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Big Little Lies, The Handmaid's Tale, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Marvel.

It really hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Also I  don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again.

I considered asking her out a while back, but she dropped several hints that she isn\u2019t into me that way (she told me that I\u2019m not her type, she said \u201cI just wanna be friends with everyone\u201d, and she expressed interest in another guy while I was with her. I don\u2019t think she knows I have a crush on her but I know she only sees me as a friend). I started talking to one of my other close friends (16F) about it, and we\u2019re sure she doesn\u2019t like me that way. However, about two months ago, I moved to another state (one of my parents is in the military), but before that, 17F said that after 16F and I graduate we should all move in together (I know lots of teens say they\u2019re gonna move in with their friends, but this is different. It feels more realistic). Obviously, it isn\u2019t smart to move in with someone you have a crush on, especially if they don\u2019t feel the same way, so I decided that, before we moved in together, I\u2019d tell her. I thought that, by that point, I would\u2019ve gotten over her, but it\u2019s been two months and I still get sad and jealous when she\u2019s hanging out with other guys. I don\u2019t know how to make myself not like her, but I know that\u2019s what would be best for us. I was talking to 16F last night and she said she thought I should tell 17F now because it keeps stressing me out and making me feel sad. I always thought that I would tell her closer to when we moved in together, but now I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the smartest thing to do. Even if I did get over her, it\u2019d still be weird and maybe even creepy for her to here that I had a crush on her for upwards of a year. I\u2019m really scared of telling 17F because our relationship is one of the best relationships in my life and I don\u2019t want to do anything that could even ruin it a little bit, but I don\u2019t see how telling her would not make it worse. I wish that all I wanted was to be her friend but I don\u2019t know how to make myself want that and 16F wants me to tell her soon. I feel bad for being jealous of other guys and I feel bad for feeling this way about 17F and I feel bad because I know that\u2019s not what she wants and I know that it will ruin our relationship at least a little bit.\n\nShould I tell 17F now? Or wait and hope that I get over her, knowing that if I don\u2019t then I\u2019ll eventually have to tell her and the longer I wait, the creepier it\u2019ll get?

But what I did not do was seek out friends for the purpose of using them as crutches or targets for my venting. \n\nUnless I'm mistaken, this subreddit is really not intended for mentally ill people or people in crisis to seek a \"friend\" to support them through their crisis. Call me old fashioned, but I think friendship needs to be a two way street.\n\nMy opinion: some people are not healthy enough to be seeking out new friends or relationships. If you can't talk about anything except all of your suffering, then it's really not fair to your new friend that you meet - they end up serving as a de-facto therapist. Again, not fair. You have to make an effort to be a good friend. You have to try to contribute to conversations, be somewhat pleasant, ask questions, and make efforts to sustain your new friendships. Doing these things - in other words, thinking of other people and being a good friend - I actually think contributes to good mental health. Thinking about someone other than myself, being more selfless. Being less wrapped up in my own head and thoughts. But I digress.\n\nThere are ways to get human connection, support, and interaction during a tough time. But I really think you need to be able to give and reciprocate and function in a somewhat healthy way in order to start new relationships of any kind. \n\nSome people like helping others and listening to them. I do, at times. I have offered to listen to people having a hard time - but more often than not, they disappear immediately once their crisis is over. They didnt want friendship. I've heard a number of times \"Thank you so much for listening to me - but I dont think we would make good friends. I really just wanted to vent. Thanks so much byee!\" I didnt offer to help for the sake of getting something in return - but I didnt expect such rude treatment either - or to be used so blatantly. \n\nPart of mental health is learning how to have healthy relationships and learning well-adjusted social skills. You have to give as well as receive in relationships. \n\nThis sub has brought me some great friends. But I want it to be as great as I know it can be. It's tough to look for a friend and end up just being used. \n\nSubreddits that are more suited to people experiencing crisis:\nr/needhelp r/vent r/offmychest r/therapists r/depression r/anxiety r/kindvoice and many others. \n\nLet's please keep this subreddit for friendship. \n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk. :)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

It's hard to be close to someone you don't trust, y'know?\n\nAnyway, that's what has lead me to making this post. I've never really ever made friends on reddit before so I'm not entirely sure what to put. I guess I'll give you a small brief of myself and my interests!\n\nI'm a 22 year old gay trans guy and live in the UK. I'm hoping to move down south since I love the sea and it's always been a dream to live within walking distance of one.\n\nI'm not really sure how to write about my interests so I'll just do a quick list and then we can go from there:  \nPokemon, True crime, Conspiracy theories, Horror, Nintendo games (Splatoon, Fire Emblem), Films (Namely Quentin Tarantino), Yakuza Game Series (this is my main interest right now), RP and character creation, Stranger Things, Breaking Bad, Orange is the new black, Peaky Blinders and Musicals! \n\nI love watching movies and shows with people, my job is freelance so I spend a lot of time at home just working so it's nice to put something on while I work. I really enjoy reacting to things with someone, it's fun to have someone you can discuss with in the moment of whatever it is you're watching.\n\nI like to RP! Mainly my own OCs but I'm very self conscious of my writing due to my dyslexia but it's still something I really enjoy doing. I'm not huge into fantasy RP but I enjoy making characters and world building.\n\nI'm big into Pokemon, it's something I've always loved and my work revolves around the Pokemon community so it's a huge part of my life.\n\nI guess if I had to describe what I'm looking for is a sort of nurturing relationship. I'm in a rough place admittedly and it'd be nice to get to know someone who kinda enjoys taking on that role in a relationship. Doesn't have to be romantic but if things progressed that way, I'd be down with it.\n\nI can be a huge potty mouth and my sense of humor is also a little crude at times. I'm pretty open with NSFW topics and some of my jokes revolve around that so a word of warning if that's not your thing. I'm never outright disrespectful or anything like that and I'd like to think I know when the place and time is to make \"bad\" jokes.\n\nI love cats! I'm a huge animal lover over all but especially cats. I can't imagine getting along with someone who hates cats though, it'd honestly irk me but I don't care if you're just indifferent. Just.. pure hatred is a huge no-no for me.\n\nIt's 2am here and right now it'd be nice to have someone to chat on discord with about well, anything! I do detest small talk though so it'd be great to just have a topic in mind because I can't carry a conversation that's just \"Hey what's up\" because I suck.\n\nI do like to voice call but not right away since I'm a little shy! But it's something I would like to do eventually if we become friends.\n\nIf you've managed to read this wall of text then congrats! You get a cookie. If you do think we'd get on or want to chat then message me your name, age, location, interests and let's see where this goes!\n\nI'm very 420 friendly and would prefer that you are too but no hard drugs please.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I'm a twenty year old with no friends, do you know how hard that is? I have little energy, on antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication. It's not that I'm antisocial, if anything I've been trying to talk to as many people as I can but people are busy and don't have time for you or are just not wanting to hang out. I'm dying of loneliness I just want at least one friend I can call and talk about random shit, I want a friend I can call in the middle of the night and cry with. I want an actual friend but I'm incredibly picky. I want a friend that is like me, doesn't talk your ear off and listens while giving just the right amount of advice. I consider myself to be very low key and spontaneous and fun but I have no one to be that with. I'm actually dying of loneliness and would even appreciate one person messaging.\n\n I hate people who ghost as well. I want a long term friend, who I can talk on cam with and also on the phone and message. I'm not looking for an internet friend, I'm looking for an actual friend. Seems too much to ask for these days. Just fucking lonely. It's slowly killing me.\n\n\nA little about me - I'm trying to learn programming languages and I'm starting off with JavaScript and python. I'd like to be a software engineer one day and plan on going to uni for it. I'm a BIG animal lover, please send me pictures of your pets and we'll giggle and goggle over them. I am a big introvert. I like riding my bike although it gives me anxiety and I'm not quite used to it. I used to play games a lot but I haven't recently, games actually give me anxiety now haha. I love horror movies but I always close my eyes, I enjoy walks in the shade because I fucking hate the sun. (The sun and I don't mix). I'm really pessimistic. I can be funny and awkward. Really awkward sometimes but I'm not antisocial, I'm just awkward lol.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I get why, she is dealing with her own issues, but it feels less like that and more like she just doesn't want to.

Anyways, let's get straight to the point! Why should you be my friend? There has to be a reason, right. Otherwise, you'd be wasting your time, so give me a chance to try my level best to convince you why being my friend is a worthwhile experience (or it could not be a worthwhile experience depending on how things go, but I can assure you that I'll actually put in some effort to hold a conversation with you despite not being the best conversationalist (I'm the worst.))\n\nI'm going start by introducing myself. My name is Rasew and I'm a nobody. I've always been a nobody. The reason for that is I've always been an introvert who prefers his own comfort zone. I've never had any friends. It never bothered until 3 years ago, which was what motivated me to escape my comfort zone to meet new people online. Over the years, I've met various people; some became very good friends for a while, but we gradually parted ways due to fading interest. At the same time, I've met some evil people that made me want to go back to staying in my comfort zone, which is where I'm right now.\n\nIn the past few months, I came to the conclusion that I needed a break from social media to fix my depression, but since I've been getting better, I'd like to put myself out there once again. I'll be honest with you by saying that I'm not the most interesting person in the world. I've the social skills of a potato, so please bear with me (I also have autism. Just an interesting fact that I wanted to share.) I'm trying to adopt a few hobbies, which mostly involve reading (I love science and engineering, but on the fiction side of things, I like to read anything that I find interesting, which could range from harry potter to a bunch of movie novelizations like last week, I read the movie novelization for spiderman. I'm also into comics btw), writing, watching movies and TV Shows, singing, playing musical instruments, playing strategy games like chess. \n\nObviously, I dont do all of this, but I'm still in the process of healing, so once I'm functioning properly, I'll be adopting ALL the hobbies that I just mentioned. As of right now, I just focus on watching movies/TV shows and reading fiction books. \n\nIn case you're wondering what stuff like to read and watch, I'd like to reserve for when we have a conversation.\n\nNow, I'd like to move on by telling you what I expect in a friendship. I'm open to talking to anyone provided that you're really nice to me and that you're 18 or older.\n\nI only use WhatsApp and reddit chat.\n\nFeel free to hit me up if you're interested in talking to me. \nEither way, I wish you all best luck.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

It is one of my favorite subjects in school.\n\n\n- Programming. I really enjoy it.\n\n\n- Languages. I speak Czech, German and English and I am currently learning French.

(Lots to explain ).", "author": "borednoel2", "self_text": "So starting off I would like to say hi. I'm new to this reddit, but anywho me and my ex friend let's call her Sarah had been best friends from grade 7, and started to fall out in my junior year of highschool, now I graduated about year ago, but this still affects me a lot since it was a 7 year friendship.\n\n\nThe beginning to the end started when I moved away and we couldn't see each other as much but I was still in the same school district. As time went by she started dating this shitty guy that I knew from the beginning was wasting her time and many other people who were her friends felt the same. The thing is our issue began when I told her how I felt about ot since well she asked and of course that in turn made her isolate herself from me and our former friend group. This of course kinda pissed me off a bit, but I let it slide.\n\n\n \nAs time went on I saw her less and less then winter break finished and she told me that he broke up with for another girl (the same girl he constantly broke up with her for by the way), but anywho I comforted her, but it didnt matter as time continued it was constantly on and off to the point that the only thing you can say about her was oh she's that nice girl that can draw and constantly throws herself back to an asshole, so of  course me being the protective friend I tried numerous times to help over two years and didnt work out, I was burned out and ended the relationship and it was a bit public which I honestly dont regret. It is what it is just highschool petty shit.\n\n\n\nNow to start off her horrible relationship was not the reason why I broke things off it was her whole being. Overtime when she was constantly interacting with that boy she changed a lot in the bad way. She would neglect me a lot and hang with other people and leave me out of things but it didnt really bother me at all. we can all have different friends I dont care. It just pissed me off when she would say you never hang with me anymore, you never invite over your house, and would get jealous and contact me when she saw me hang with my other group (who by the way saw how bad I was being treated and wanted me to drop her already). \n\n\n\nWhile I never said shit if I saw her hanging with other people. That she never invited me to do things either. Also I always tried to include her with all my sleepovers or hangouts, but at times I couldn't do them because of family issues and financial reasons, sleepovers and hangouts can be expensive at times . \n\n\n\nShe also made me feel as if I was not a good friend at all on several occasions when I spoke my mind, since i can be a very opinionated person, that's just me. She never made me feel as if my feelings mattered at all and anytime that I told her that she would say that she cared but never tried any form of action to back up those words. While I always had her back and told the truth because I fucking hate lying. I was 100 percent and told her somethings that were bad at my end with no regret because I dont like hiding shit to someone I truly care about. We are all not perfect.\n\n\nThat leads to my problem, after about a while I discovered that she broke up with said guy after 3 years of  a bullshit on and off relationship and found that she possibly has a new guy and got really happy for her, and think she may have changed. Do I contact her ? ( the only reason I ask is because no matter what I was always the one to check up on her while she always never did and one summer while she was focusing her attention on a guy that clearly didn't care as much for her, and other people she barely talks to now, I was in a bad state. I wasnt eating, my mental state was bad and I had suicidal thoughts and really needed my bestfriend but she wasnt there, she never was. I remember when she forgot my birthday too, because I know all she could think about was him, it really hurt me you know). \n\n\nSo should I contact her or leave her alone?  I'm a bit conflicted.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I  ended  up seeing Yolanda at a family get together; turns out our parents  were  both born in the same country. Ever since then, I started hanging  out  with her and her friend Ingrid in Sunday school. Yolanda is more   outgoing than Ingrid. Yolanda is an extrovert; me and Ingrid are on the   introverted side.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_-\n\n5th  grade:  nothing changed. I enjoyed hanging out with Yolanda and Ingrid  in  Sunday school...but we never made plans to hang out outside of the   school environment. I never felt left out in their conversations;   overall, we were friends who saw each other on a regular basis, and I   felt content\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n6th  grade: right  before middle school started, Yolanda went to a summer  camp. She met a  girl named Rebecca over there. Once 6th grade started,  Rebecca became a  part of our group. A part of me thinks it's my fault  Rebecca treated  me invisibly (and Ingrid - but then again she didn't  ever show interest  in interacting with Ingrid) for the rest of 7th and  8th grade (read  below why); it's just sad to see a few mishaps caused a  snowball  effect:\n\n\\-  At the start of 6th  grade, I happened to see Rebecca at a restaurant  with her mom. Her mom  and my mom exchanged phone numbers - they arranged  a few playdates (one  was at an ice skating rink, another was at my  house).\u00a0 For some weird  reason, my mind froze up when I was with her  both times - I should have  tried to initiate conversations, even if they  were insignificant/ended  way too soon.\n\n\\- A couple of  times Rebecca wanted to chat with me online; being the  idiot I was, I  declined her Gmail chat requests since I had no idea what  Gmail  chatting was a thing. I should have got back to her in Sunday  school  and said, \"Hey! You tried to chat with me - I was confused so I   declined your request. What exactly is a Gmail chat? We can definitely   do that together one weekend!\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n7th   grade: My mom met Rebecca's mom a few times; she told me that  Rebecca's  mom asked her, \"Does your daughter \\[me\\] have any friends at  school?\" A  few time Rebecca asked me, \"How come you don't talk about  your friends?\"  (she never asked Ingrid, even though at times she spoke  less than me).  When I gave Rebecca names of the \\*very\\* few/former  friends I had, she  said, \"Tell me about them.\" It was during this time I  sensed that  Rebecca ignored me and Ingrid and completely focused all  her attentions  on Yolanda when conversing. You know how there are quiet  people who are  very talkative once they \\*selectively\\* find someone who  is good enough  for them? Well, Rebecca was like that - rarely making  eye contact with  me nor Ingrid in any face-to-face group conversations,  and only with  Yolanda.\n\n\\-  All 4  of us were sitting in a row of desks (Yolanda was on one end,  Rebecca  was on the other end, and me and Ingrid were in the middle).  Rebecca  leaned her head \\*all the way\\* towards Yolanda, only caring if  Yolanda  heard the exciting news that she \\[Rebecca\\] bought a new pair of  cool  Converse shoes!\n\n\\-  Turns out,  Yolanda and Rebecca had \\*a lot\\* in common: had the same  celebrity  crush, enjoyed the same music, and enjoyed reading the same  books.\n\n\\-   Yolanda invited me and Rebecca to a sleepover; during it, we all   watched a movie on a book series the other two adored (I wasn't into   it/ignorant of it) - I got a vibe that they were bonding (or Rebecca was   ignoring me? Was I overreacting - I forgot the details) better with   each other than me and was sulky for the rest of sleepover event.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n8th   grade: I felt shittier - Ingrid stopped coming to Sunday school. I was   with Yolanda and Rebecca. I felt Yolanda tried to give me and Rebecca   equal attention, but Rebecca still does not. Rebecca still made eye   contact with Yolanda (and no one else - i.e., me), but I feel she   excluded me as well intentionally; I felt worse since Ingrid wasn't   there.\n\n\\-  For instance, she went  on a field trip for middle school; when she came  back and talked to me,  she didn't tell me much about it. When she saw  Yolanda (who returned  back from her field trip, at a \\*different\\* middle  school), she acted  like a blabber mouth, telling Yolanda \\*every single\\*  possible detail on  some big schoolwide scandal that happened during her  field trip. I  felt unworthy\n\n\\-  When Yolanda came  back from her field trip, Rebecca's mom  enthusiastically greeted her  with \"Yolanda! You're back!\" and not even  acknowledging me. I think one  other time, all three of us were walking  together in Sunday school and  Rebecca's mom greeted Yolanda instead of  me; irony is she met me  before she met Yolanda; did Rebecca's mom  deliberately ignore me too?  Should I have confronted her too?\n\n\\-   One day, there was a mini-carnival at the Sunday school. Rebecca   deliberately ignored me twice: 1) she was holding cotton candy in her   hand and offered some to Yolanda and not to me, even though I was right   there 2) she told Yolanda a joke by making 100% eye contact with her   (i.e., faced Yolanda by turning her \\[Rebecca's back\\] towards me) and   didn't care if I listened.\n\n\\-  Me,  Rebecca, and Yolanda, all went to a youth night event; the first  night,  Rebecca was enthusiastically jumping around Yolanda, grabbing her  hand  and talking to her animatedly...I felt ignored. My dad saw that,  said  he didn't approve of Rebecca \"jumping around like a monkey,\" and  said  she was ignoring me on purpose - but I should let this go.\n\n\\-   At one point, Rebecca said she knows Yolanda better than she knows   Ingrid and me; I think this is bullshit - she just met Yolanda the exact   same summer before she met Ingrid and me.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nYes,   these all happened \\~10-12 years ago...but half of me wishes I had the   courage to confront Rebecca: list out every single time she made me  feel  excluded and tell her, say she \"doesn't know me well enough\" is a   shitty excuse for ignoring me since she befriended Yolanda the summer   vacation before I met her, slap her face if she didn't take me seriously   and call her a \"bitch,\" and potentially leave behind Yolanda and   Rebecca without worrying about being alone at Sunday school. Even if the   outcome was ugly, maybe then I wouldn't be thinking about these events   over and over again.\n\nAfter  I  moved from CA (end of 8th grade), Yolanda and I emailed each other   regularly until high school finished; half of me thinks she cut me off   since she changed into a completely different, wilder person (i.e., not   religiously conservative - in Sunday school she was the most talkative   and funny one in our group, but she was still religiously conservative)   according to her social media posts. When I got my Facebook account in   high school, Ingrid and Yolanda both accepted my friend requests -   though I never kept in touch with Ingrid. I think Rebecca forgot about   my existence - I don't care about that for obvious reasons; I don't know   if Yolanda and Rebecca still keep in touch because of proximity; a  good  part of me thinks they don't since Yolanda changed after entering   college. I refuse to get in touch with Yolanda ever again - I reached   out to her at the end of freshman year of college and she didn't contact   me ever again after one night of texting each other/catching up.\n\nI   cried many times when I came back from Sunday school because of   Rebecca; in 7th and 8th grade there were a few times where I acted   mood/gave silent treatments within the group without explaining why (I   wish I did that - if you list out every single detail/evidence people   will show sympathy towards you) - but it was \\*all\\* because of Rebecca -   not Ingrid nor Yolanda. Both of my parents said Rebecca was excluding  me  on purpose and she wasn't a good friend; they simply said to act  like  nothing happened just to be a part of the group to avoid being  lonely.\n\nI  just think hearing your  honest opinions will make me feel better and  help me find \"release.\"  Overall, summary is I feel Rebecca ignored me  and Ingrid (I'm pretty  sure she didn't give a damn) because of Yolanda,  and I don't know if I  feel justified to feel this way...a key thing to  note is that this  friendship group formed because of Yolanda - first  Ingrid became her  friend, then I met Yolanda, and then Rebecca  befriended Yolanda. By  \"ignore\" I mean that Rebecca didn't make eye  contact when saying  anything - one week I didn't feel ignored by her,  another week I did -  it was like a bunch of ups and downs. In addition,  in 7th and 8th grade  the group formed into a \"real friendship\" (i.e.,  having sleepovers and  hanging out, instead of being limited to the  school environment) -  I'll admit that Yolanda hung out with me more than  she hung out with  Rebecca in middle school...and a few times there was  the  me/Yolanda/Rebecca triad for hanging out. I'll also add that a  couple  of times I think Rebecca told me that I was a \"serious\" person.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I'm friendly with everyone. There is nobody I dislike, and I would happily and do happily see most of them outside classes and during research time. Just, some more than others.\n\nOne person in particular I made friends with through another friend as we haven't shared in classes together (we took different options and have different compulsories). We became friends end of last year, but I quickly realised he was very troubled and very depressed due to a really weird family and upbringing that stunted his social skills and left him with crippling anxiety amongst other things. Not inherently a problem, I have anxiety related to grades and work and tests and have had on/off depression since a teen so I empathise with him. The problem is, he has no filter and absolutely no social awareness. To date, every single time I have seen him one on one or in a group, he discusses his issues, feelings and problems. He makes everything about him, and always tells about how lonely he is his conflicted problems with family, what his therapist says. He brings the mood down for everything, and YOU leave feeling miserable. Miserable because you can't help him but frankly more miserable because he makes you feel bad that things aren't as bad for you. I have persevered and assumed that in time with some caring friends and a good therapist he would gain these much needed social skills but boy did I think wrong. On one particular social occasion I invited him to a friends thing which included people not at university he had not met previously and he unloaded his problems on to them and they were visibly disturbed and it ruined the whole evening. I was so embarrassed. On another occasion we had a games night and he didn't pay attention to the rules or the turns and instead got angry he didn't win.\n\nHe is a good person but he's just no fun to be around. It's my birthday soon, and he assumed I would do something and it would include him. I tactfully said I was doing a small thing with old friends and he was disappointed but not offended but I hated having to lie. I don't want to abandon the friendship because that would make him worse, but he's terrible for my mental health and I have been distancing myself from him as much as possible over the last 3 months because my mental health is bad at the moment and I can barely carry myself let alone anybody else so I am surrounding myself with positive and peaceful people which he is not. My partner has said that he doesn't disagree with my decision, but has warned me that this friend will likely here of my birthday festivities after the event from somebody else and this will all blow up, but what is the alternative? I can't go up to him and say \"hey so I am doing something for my birthday and some people from uni are going but not you because you've proven time and time again that you can't enjoy a group event and behave like a normal human being and I want everyone who attends to have fun and not be made to feel awkward by your monologuing\" now can I? Before I get down voted for not understanding what it's like to be him - believe me I really do. I was a lot like him at 14-17. Hardly any friends, separated parents, crippling depression. But there were 2-3 trusted people I went to for help including my therapist, I didn't drown the whole world and everyone in it with my sorrows. I had the self-awareness to know that everyone around me couldn't help me and being miserable would drain them. Following therapy, I then made more friends and entered into relationships. But I honestly feel like at the stage he's at now it's to the benefit of everyone at my party including me to put boundaries up and exclude him from this event. I still see him about once a week, but I don't feel comfortable with more.\n\nTl;dr am I cruel for putting a boundary between me and a friend with severe depression?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I lived in Texas for four years 6-9 grades. and then i moved from Texas to my current state of residence.\n\nIn Tennessee i met a lot of good friends. moving was hard because we never played online games together, however, we do now so i don't miss them at all. \n\nIn Texas I met the best people I have ever met. I hated 6th grade becasue i had no friends. This however does change in 7th grade as i meet my best friend (who will be called BB short for Best bro \\[M\\]) along with my other best friend ( who will be called BG short for best girl) along with some others. We all hung out for lunch and became super tight. we told each other everything and we all loved each other as family. We were all in band so we got to hang out all the time outside school as well. BB was a grade ahead of us so he went on to HS while we all stayed in MS, no problems because i still saw him a lot. In 8th grade a new girl came to town from Guam and she instantly became one with the group. 8th grade goes by and we're all hanging all the time getting ready for marching band, and enjoying each others company. So 9th grade comes so we all join marching band. Myself, being kinda fat, was never any good at marching. So add in a 4 week band camp of being with my closest friends and we were all friends for life. we didn't do anything without each other. the rest of the year our group expands to be about 10 people, not just people, super deep friends who would march to the ends of the Earth with each other. Then my mother tells us we must leave. So we packed our bags and left. 10th grade goes by and I miss them everyday, we message often but its nothing like being there. I met minimal friends being here and wish i could go back, even though I know i cannot. So here I am waking up at near 1PM just having a dream of being with my friends, to wake up and realize it was a dream.

For context, she and I have formed a friendship through our husbands whom have been friends since they were children. \n \n Due to the fact that I'm pretty introverted and deal with social anxiety even within interactions with my own family members, I have to reeeaaally make an effort when I decide someone is worth ignoring the ever-present voice telling me I'm just an annoyance or an inconvenience to everyone I encounter.\n\nMy friend, on the other hand is definitely a \"girls girl\". She still hangs out with friends she's had since elementary school and some from her early 20's freewheeling days. Within the last year or so I've probably been getting a lot more of her time than they have. 80% of the time she's the one who reaches out and she's verbally told me how happy she is that we've gotten as close as we are. But at times its definitely felt like the time we spend together is focused on helping her work through her depression, marriage problems, feelings of inadequacy...etc. This isn't intrinsically a problem for me. \n\nI'm very aware that what I bring to the table in terms of my connections with other people is empathy and acute understanding of the human psyche (having to reason yourself out of an emotional breakdown enough times will give you that insight) I'm very used to acting as a counselor for those with whom I'm close, so our dynamic hasn't made me feel unfulfilled in our friendship. \n\nHowever, there have definitely been times where I havent felt like a priority. Most recently, my birthday. I'm not big on parties or being the center of attention so I didn't really plan for anything aside from a few things I wanted to do over the weekend. Two days before my birthday, she texts me saying that I'm her #1 priority this weekend and asks if we (my husband and I) would want to come spend the weekend in a little beach community we typically spend holidays at (which is also where our husbands and a third friend of theirs met and basically grew up together)  I couldn't think of a better way to spend my birthday as it's become one of my very favorite places.\n\nHere's where the problem comes into play. The next day, literally less than 12 hours later,she texts me saying that her sister's family is coming into town so they don't think they'll be able to go. Her sister had said some things a few weeks prior that had really been having a negative impact on her emotional well being and her family was pressuring her to work through it, though she had been saying she wasn't ready to talk to her. I told her that I totally understood and that she just needed to do whatever brought her the most peace. I was bummed but I got it. She never showed even the slightest bit of remorse for cancelling, but I chalked it up to her not being in a great place and having to focus all her energy on confronting the situation with her sister. This was two fridays ago.\n\nLast night, my husband showed me a post from this past weekend of her with a group of friends on a trip to the place we were supposed to go. (To be clear, not the weekend we were supposed to go) I know she hasnt seen these friends as much lately but it just felt like a punch in the gut knowing that instead of making up the trip she cancelled with me, she planned one with them to the very same place the very next weekend. \n\nI'm honestly so hurt and logically I know the mature thing would be to just tell her how her actions have made me feel, but I dont know how she'll take it and this isnt the first time she's unapologetically blown me off. It's been a really long time since I've had to confront a problem in a friendship and I'm just not sure how to navigate this in a way that wont hurt our friendship going forward. \n\nTL:DR My friend went on a trip with a group the weekend after cancelling the same trip with me", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

So, long story short, my father passed away last year. He left me a quite large amount of money and properties. I'm in my twenties, I don't have kids, and I love to travel, so I thought about taking a break from work, and go on a big trip around Asia, Europe and Oceania. One of my best friends is going through a  rough time, so I decided to invite her. I have to say that she has a job with a steady income. So I invite her, I say, \"I'll pay for your flights and the stay\". I made it clear, I was gonna pay for that, she said yes. Yesterday we went out for dinner to discuss the details of the trip, and she says something along the lines of \"I'm not gonna take any money to the trip\", so I'm assuming she expects me to pay for everything. Like, for every meal she eats, everything she wants to buy. I don't know what to do. After I got home yesterday, she texted me saying that she was disappointed I didn't pay for her dinner. (Wich by the way I was going to, but she asked the waiter to split the tab while I was getting my jacket, so I couldn't do anything, but that's beyond the point.)\n\nI thought having money doesn't mean you have to pay for everything?\nAnd this isn't the first time, she has done similar things before.\n\nShe has some health issues and needs surgery, a surgery she cannot afford, so I offered to pay for it too. It's not like I'm not generous. I don't know what to think. Ever since I inherited the money, our relationship hasn't been the same. She is always expecting me to pay or implying something.\n\nI don't know what I'm looking for writing this here, I guess I'm venting and also looking for similar experiences or comfort, maybe? I don't really know. Maybe I'm the problem and I don't see it? \n\nI'm too embarrassed to tell my friends about it, mostly because most of them know her too. So I guess I'm looking for answers on here. Thanks if you made it this far.\n\nEdit: typos and adding things", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I just turned 22 this month (I keep forgetting that I'm no longer 21).

Anything with an interesting plot will entrance me to finish it. This goes for movies, shows and anime as well. I admit that I haven't really seen any shows besides Catfish, Running Man, Jersey Shore, Kitchen Nightmare, a whole bunch of cooking competitions, etc. There's so much anime I haven't seen yet either but currently, I'm a big fan of one punch man.\n\nI also spend time listening to a variety of music. It ranges from instrumental, OSTs, anime musics, pop, kpop, jpop, nightcore, trance, etc. \n\nI'm also a gamer. I don't really have any consoles besides the original wii... but I played on pc/mobile. I tend to limit myself to free games because I want to save but that might  change in the future. Maybe. A few has been trying to convince me to get a XBOX. I do play pubg on mobile though.\n\nTl;dr: I like to read books, watch youtube/anime, and game.

My new job offers me a lot of free time during the whole day &amp; I just miss having someone to talk to so I find myself here once again, giving it another go.

I'll tell you what's up &amp; I never lie (except to my parents &amp; teachers when I was younger, but who hasn't?)\n\n- I'm chill &amp; easy to talk to, so I've been told by a lot of people. \n\n- I can be blunt sometimes but I have manners &amp; as long as you're nice, I'll always respond with respect. \n\n- I like getting to know people, learning about their stories always fascinates me. \n\n- Not a gamer because I'm probably too old for that shite. \n\n- I will forever be a dog person. If you're a dog owner, you're my kind of person (50%)\n\n- I like people with good sense of humor because we all need to laugh more often. \n\n- I like voice call too if I know you enough to switch to another platform. \n\n- I like binge-watching stuff.

Currently residing in the UK. I will keep this fairly short and snappy just so we have a basis to extend and talk about if you're interested enough. Straight up, I'm lonely (not that I don't try not to be) and don't seem to form anything long term which makes me feel somewhat down and alone. \n\nThis summer has been fairly boring so far with minimal conversations so I'm hoping to change that. I have just finished my A levels and I'm waiting anxiously for results day to see what university has accepted me \ud83e\udd1e. I am an avid programmer and computer scientist that spends most of his time writing, patching, bug reporting and packaging for the Debian project. I am part of the med team that handles bio informatics and medical related softwares. Long story short, I've been interested in computer science since the age of 8 and I've spent a year writing cryptographic modules and even my own basic kernel in asm. I am hoping to work my way up to becoming a debian developer one day, that is once I accumulate enough time and key signatures. \n\nI'm into maths and physics too. Those have always been my strong subjects. More of a hobby thing; I do like talking long frequent walks as a means of venting and relaxing, as well as traveling to various countries. I've traveled to various countries in the middle East (Bahrain, Dubai, Qatar, Iran), Italy, a few Greek Islands and Canada, though I'd really love to extend this list. I do like listening to music, and my preferred genre is classic. It tends not to give me a headache haha. I'm very flexible when it comes to movies too and I tend to watch anything that's been newly released. I love horror! I also play a fair bit of games on PC like GTA 5 (fivem), Rust, Garry's mod, TF2, Minecraft and a few others. \n\nI feel like this is getting a bit too lengthy so the rest can be reserved for if you'd like to get to know each other \u263a. \n\nAs a genuine person that loves to listen and be there for friends, I am not the type to ghost at all so rest assured. It also doesn't matter if you suffer from anything such as depression or not, because we certainly still be good friends. I do hope that if we do talk and you don't want to have any contact with me for whatever reason, that you just tell me. Ghosting is plain hurtful and feels like a stab in the heart and is happening way too much to me. \n\nAdditionally, I can be reached either here (chat or PM), IRC (I'm very active in snoonet), Discord and even Snapchat. So feel free to write to me if you'd like to be good friends \ud83d\ude0a.\n\nHope to hear from someone soon,\n\nShayan", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

It\u2019s going to be all three of us alone together both days at the festival and I\u2019m not sure what to do. I\u2019d smack the shit out of her but I don\u2019t want to ruin my friendship with our mutual friend as she enables her bs behavior. I bought the tickets before I realized how awkward it\u2019s gonna be.They're non refundable  What should I do?\n\n\n\n\nBack Story (Long Story)This wasn\u2019t our first falling out. We had stopped being friends for the same reasons but I thought she had grown and thought I was being unreasonable but aout a few months ago I stopped being friends with this with her because she was in short an extremely shitty friend. Last summer was very rough for me. I lost my job and was having trouble finding work in the field. On top of that I had an IUD which was a bad idea and caused me extreme pain. I told her that I hadn\u2019t really left my house in weeks close to a month. I\u2019d do my driving lessons (I know I\u2019m a late in life driver I\u2019m 24 and was 23 at the time-I know irrelevant) which were an hour and lock myself in my room. Instead of reaching out she\u2019d tell me about her ventures downtown (where I live) at clubs and bars. Even after mentioning that I\u2019d like to go out with them some time seeing as I lived down town and she\u2019d like what I\u2019d say and never really mention anything about it. She\u2019d send me drunk snaps. On top that she was on a soft ball team and their games and practice times were located literally across the street from my apartment and she\u2019d not once say hey come by. She invited me once but not to hang out only to play softball because they were short of players. Some time passed and she started seeing this really shitty guy. He\u2019d sometimes ghost her or take days to respond to her texts. She found out that he had had a history of betting with his friends on the women he was seeing to see who could sleep with them. She eventually put two and two together and concluded that he was doing the same with her. Me being a blind friend who wanted to help I advised her to confront him. Alas she\u2019s a spindless bitch made little bitch and passively confronted him via text. Weeks passed and she continued to play soft ball with them (he and his friends were on the team) and she\u2019d go out with them (not inviting me). I ended up inviting her to this grad school fair to get out of my slump. After beating it out of her she told me that she apologized to him and was going to to the movies with him. She invited him. Annoyed I said whatever. She was supposed to come by but that didn\u2019t happen because I fell asleep. Months passed by and she continues to hang out with him. Might I add he was best friends with this guy that we all knew. He was a convicted rapist and had been kicked out of our school for attempted rape. So I confronted her about hanging out with him. I told her that it concerned me and that she was putting herself in danger by being around him and his friends. She got very upset and shut down (\ud83d\ude44).  Weeks later I told her that if being with him made her happy I would try to look past it. She replied that she felt a little attacked and triggered and that she was setting \u201cboundaries\u201d with me by not telling me about her love life. Upset I didn\u2019t reply. the next day I vented on twitter and replied to her telling her that I needed some time away from her to process her and our friendship. She sounded like she understood. 3 days later I texted her and she didn\u2019t reply. After pulling teeth for a week to get her to speak to me (our mutual friends bday was that weekend) she finally replied and reduced the entire situation to me being upset about us not \u201changing out\u201d (I had mentioned to her weeks before that it hurt me that she never invited me anywhere)... She said that she didn\u2019t read my texts about my concerns prior to this blow up because they were \u201ctoo much to read\u201d. Swallowing my irritation I decided to just get over it especially since it was our friends birthday. At the time, we RARELY got to see her because she, our mutual, lived an 1 and 10mins away from our city. She and our mutual are also supposedly supposed to be best friends since high school. However the entire time M (well call her) was on her phone most of the time. She also didn\u2019t really offer much either. She didn\u2019t pay for her meal (understandable as our Mutuals bf and family was there) she didn\u2019t even bring the gift she supposedly bought knowing for a week that we were all meeting up for dinner etc. I made sure our mutual had drinks I danced with her and even helped her while pissy drunk too use the restroom while M stood around texting and tweedling her thumbs SOBER. We eventually ended up at a club (one that she suggested). By then our Mut. had gone home so it was just us and this other girl. Low and behold the guy she had been fucking (the shitty one) was there at the club.\nAfter our mutuals bday, I said that I wanted to meet up and talk and we did. She gave me a gift, a mug and a candle from B&amp;B works. We talked and I told her that it wasn\u2019t JUST the hanging out that pissed me or lack there of but also how sneaky and secretive she was. We talked and it was cool. We decided to bury the hatchet and move on. However I still noticed that she was with holding. Things weren\u2019t the same between us. So I decided to end our friendship. I sent her this long text in the middle of the day telling her why. I told her that on top of it not being the same I still held some resentment towards her. I didn\u2019t mention how pissed at her I was about her being not present during her best friends birth day. But that played into my decision too. She said i\u2019m so many words that she understood and that she felt like we had grown out of the friendship. I told her good bye blocked her on every SM platform and moved on. I told our mut. and she was sad but understood. The next week I met up with our mutual for drinks and we discussed what happened. She then goes on to say that M had made it seem like it was all one sided and that I was the one who grew out of the friendship and that I was the one who basically abandoned her. She made it sound like I came out of left field and was being mean and bullying M. I told her that wasn\u2019t true and told her that I didn\u2019t have an issue with her but that I wanted to move on. I also told her (the mutual) that she could hang out with whomever and that I understood their friendship was more long-standing than ours. Me and the mutual are close friends but I wouldn\u2019t say were tight- tight so her hanging out with M the most doesn\u2019t bother me at all. We ended up taking a trip to DC together with out M in April. Oddly enough, M would text our mutual to keep tabs on her and \u201ccheck up\u201d on her. Something she would never do in any other circumstance... That really miffed me.\n\nFast forward to today and we are planning this trip. Our mutual keeps bringing her up and I\u2019m like I truly don\u2019t give a shit if she goes. This is a once in a life time opportunity where I get to go with a friend to see ALL of my favorite artists in one setting. About a month ago I reached out to M twice on twitter to talk it out and move forward for the sake of the trip and both times she chose NOT  to reply. So I blocked again and moved on. I left communication open for 2 days and got no response. Apparently she told the Mut. and I proceeded to get angry. The mut. began to make excuses for her saying that she\u2019s just really passive and a slow texted and that \u201cshe\u2019s like that with everyone\u201d I know that\u2019s not true. M has gone to the same city where our mutual is to meet up with guys and has not once said \u201chey I\u2019m in town\u201d lol in fact she\u2019s said \u201cI forgot that you lived there\u201d she\u2019s made time for the shitty guys she dates and even invites them out. but alas I sat there rolling my eyes. it\u2019s annoying hearing her defend her but it\u2019s whatever.\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t bring M up ever but for some reason it seems like our mut. does. I also don\u2019t like that she (M) stretches the truth about what ended our friendship so she can win victim points. I can\u2019t tell her or smack her because I love our mutual and I also don\u2019t want to bring up the issues we have on the trip. I made the mistake of telling our mutual that I was open to being friends but quickly regretted what I said because A) I feel like she might go tell her B) I truly hate her and more than anything would to stomp her teeth in for lying and being self centered and self obsessed. \n\nWhat should I do? Luckily we\u2019re not staying in the same quarters but there will be times where I have to be around her. She pretends like she\u2019s this poor quiet defenseless little mouse with all this anxiety but really she has problem with manipulating the story to it seem like she\u2019s been wronged. I told our mut that I didn\u2019t want M going through life thinking her behavior was ok and she said that \u201cthat\u2019s just her personality, passive\u201d. She proceeded to call me the assertive one and alluded to the fact that I should just \u201cunderstand\u201d. I know that eventually or mut is gonna pick a side and I\u2019m gonna inevitably lose.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019m in some really deep need here. I\u2019ve got no idea where to start on this story, but I\u2019ll try to communicate it the best I can.\n\nMe and my buddy, we\u2019ll call him \u201cD\u201d, met when I was a freshman in high school, and he was a junior. We were both in band and we both played the same instrument, so we had a lot in common and we ended up hanging out a lot. He\u2019s one of those guys that\u2019s fun to be around, and you don\u2019t have to worry about offending him when you\u2019re with him, and same goes for him to me. D and I have been great friends ever since, and try to make plans to hangout whenever we can. D and I both are employed at the same place currently, so I see him often enough.\n\nD\u2019s relationship (we\u2019ll call her S) started in middle school, and has been complicated ever since. There\u2019s been on again off again things happening ever since middle school with them.\n\nSo, a little about S. When I first met her, she seemed really nice and enthusiastic to me, and she actually helped me land my first real girlfriend (we are still together today), because she had connections, and told me she\u2019d like it if I asked her to prom (I was a freshman then and so was my girlfriend, but S listed me as her date and D listed my gf as his date so we could get in, not just so freshman could go to prom, but we were really good friends with these two, and prom is about having fun with your friends). Once prom rolls around, it was my gf and I, and D &amp; S in a limo. This was the first time my gf and I realized that something wasn\u2019t right. As soon as they got in the limo, they were fighting. Non stop yelling at each other. Eventually the limo driver had to threaten them with stopping the vehicle because they were acting like such children, bickering back and forth. They were Juniors in high school. This bickering wasn\u2019t about anything other than stupid little things that didn\u2019t even matter. By the end of the night, my gf and I just wanted out of the limo, and it ruined our entire prom night. The same thing happened when D was driving all 3 of us (the same group) to go get something to eat after finals week. It was the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had. Anytime the 4 of us would get together, this kept happening, and it got the point where we cut off all contact with S. We told D that if he wanted to hang with us he couldn\u2019t bring S around anymore because the two of them combined made every situation 1000% worse. During all of this, we advised D that this was obviously not the girl for him, but he wouldn\u2019t listen at all. There was one stint my sophomore year where they broke up for about 5 months, and we thought we had finally done it, but they got together, and during the time they were apart, S contracted an STD and quickly transferred it to D. \n\nOnce they were out of high school, D enlisted in the army. S broke up with him for that (further signification that she isn\u2019t the one for him), and did the dirty with at least 5 other men. During this time, S was sending D letters about how she wanted him back so badly, the army wasn\u2019t for him, let\u2019s start a career together, all that bullsh*t. I specifically remember when my family, my gf\u2019s family, and S\u2019s family were all eating at IHOP one night, and S said \u201cmy plan is to get D\u2019s baby, and live in his parent\u2019s basement and never work a day in my life.\u201d My father was friends with D\u2019s father\u2019s boss, and advised the boss, who advised D\u2019s father, who eventually advised D. Somehow, he listened to the letters, and got discharged from the army maybe 4 months in. As soon as he gets back, all 4 of us decide to hang out, and the same thing happens. Bickering all over again.\n\nDuring my junior year of HS, D got an apartment, and S moved in with him (her family situation isn\u2019t that good). He invited my gf and I to come see it, but we said only if S wasn\u2019t there, we would. When she wasn\u2019t, we came by to see it. It\u2019s a great first apartment, 1 bed 1 bath, connected kitchen and living, 1 spare room. Not a place for 2 people to be always fighting and throwing things at each other.\n\nI\u2019ve advised him, my gf has advised him, my parents and my gf\u2019s parents have, his parents have, but he won\u2019t listen at all, and S is tearing apart all of his friendships, and I have a really bad feeling about all of this. The other day, I heard that D and S went to buy an engagement ring, and the week before that, S said she hopes she is pregnant (she isn\u2019t). D is so blinded by everything and I really care about him, since he\u2019s been a good buddy of mine for some time, but I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve taken him to lunch to explain it, dinner like 4 times, at work, at his apartment. Nothing works. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nTl;Dr: best friend for 4 years just bought engagement ring with a disaster of a human. We\u2019ve tried so hard to let him see the light but he won\u2019t. Nothing is working.

Yellow, *Howl's Moving Castle*, *Super Mario Galaxy*, *The Binding of Isaac*, *It* by Stephen King, pasta, cheesecake. The works, y'know?\n\nLeast favorites?

Nothing beats conversation, huh? So be ready for a whole lot of that. Talking with the right people is a special kind of fulfillment, and when they are indeed the right people, topics seem to never run out. If you'll just relay those three *wacky* numbers on the back of your or your parents' credit card, you can make a one-time purchase of your very own dad friend, complete with reminders to hydrate (plus medication, if you take any) and an avalanche of questionably tasteful clinginess.\n\nFluent Spanish speaker. Being Mexican helps with that. Gay, if that wasn't clear already. Writer, of sorts. Bit of a strange sort overall, which might be part of the appeal?\n\nAnyway.

Ever since then, she has been so different than what I remember her being when I was younger. She is VERY quick to make assumptions and argue. She is EXTREMELY depressed all the time and is very self centered, though I dont believe this to be her fault. I say this because she is depressed and she never ever talks to me about my plans and future willingly (even though I am riddled with anxiety). Unless I bring it up, my well-being and college plans are never brought up and I am alone, not just in planning my future but emotionally too. I spend so much time talking to her even though she should be better by now. She stopped working anymore than 40 hours a week about a year ago and she is still being this way. Just to put into perspective, both my older sibs have broken down about hwo they cant handle her with all of her emotions. I dont know what to do most of the time. She always tells me that she wants to kill herself and that she failed me as a mother. I snapped tonight when she was badgering me on what I was gonna do when she got sick. Now she is pissed again and was saying stuff like that I will never get a girl unless she will submit to me.

We have had a long history (the leaders) and have come away with several relationships that have lasted a long time. Most of us just chat when we have time and want to talk, and we talk about various things. Some subjects that come to mind: banter, our daily lives, politics, and real world stuff in general. We are all very diverse of interest, and all of us are active (we remove inactive people, who don't invest time.) I would say we have a good split of US and EU people, as well as a nice spot of Australians/SEA , and also Men/Woman ratio.\n\nWhat we're looking for is genuine people, who want to make long lasting friendships. The type of person who comes in to the chat and interacts with us, not just posts a meme and leave. If you're shy, socially awkward, we get it. We will allow you time to open up, and none of us are very judge-y. If you're coming in to this community, get ready to explore a world of genuine people with real thoughts and feelings, this is not a meme fest, although it can be. We have several channels and topics of discussions going on, and we're quite active as a rule - politics, not safe, selfies, introductions etc. Introducing yourself and showing yourself are highly encouraged, though not mandatory.\n\nIdeally you will be:\n\n\\- Honest (I do not want meme personalities or personas here. If you have crippling depression we get it, but be yourself.)\n\n\\- Interactive\n\n\\- Willing to voice chat sometimes or be very text-active\n\n\\- Authentic\n\n\\- Be looking for real friends from real people\n\n\\- An adult\n\nThis community is based on that, community - it's not a chat room. We're cultivating friendship, working on talking to each other, getting to know each other etc. Personalities will clash, not everyone will like each other and that's fine. The admins are well versed in this kind of situation from experience, and will know what to do about it.\n\nIf you're interested, please drop a message for the link, and leave a bit about yourself (especially your age!)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Sorry about any mistakes, English isn't my first language etc.)\n\nI've known my best friend for about 6 years and I love her dearly. We're very close, share opinions, hang out together a lot, but there's something I just don't know how to address and I hate the way it's making me feel. When it comes to discussing any tougher-than-average subjects, my friend acts as if I'm made of glass, and is so obviously careful with every word it makes me irrationally mad.\n\nFor a bit of context, we used to live together, sharing a flat for a couple years. I've got anxiety and panic issues (doing a bit better now than before). What I think started it: about a year and a half ago a mutual friend of ours died in a car crash. It was devastating for me and I had a breakdown. I got depressed, couldn't talk to anyone or take care of myself and ended up moving back with family for a while, which turned out to be even worse but that's a different story - point is we were apart for a few months, and when I came back, something was off.\n\nI started noticing that every time she approaches a \"difficult\" subject she's very, very careful with her words. I should appreciate she's trying to be nice or thoughtful but instead I feel weak and patronised, as if she still doesn't trust that I'm able to handle tough conversation, which makes me wildly insecure. She's always prefacing sentences with \"don't get anxious over it\" and \"sorry to bring this up but\". The behavior per se isn't what makes me feel bad - it's that it happens all the time. It feels condescending, like she's constantly expecting me to break down again. At some points I tried telling her \"you don't need to worry so much when talking about it\", or asking her to please just be upfront with me and not sugarcoat everything, but it doesn't really change. I don't know how to have a full blown conversation about it without sounding like a thankless asshole, and it's damaging our friendship.\n\nI know that she probably means well. I feel ungrateful and a bad friend.\n\ntl;dr I had a breakdown a while ago and my best friend constantly treats me as if I'll have another which makes me feel like shit", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She even has an instagram account showing her body and how attractive she is. \n\nI am not the ugliest but cannot be compared to her at all. \n\nIn the end, I could not handle to be her friend anymore. I could not see her smoking with scars on her arms saying she is not that much of a pretty girl, or there was another girl as pretty as she is trying to steal her boyfriend. \n\nI could not avoid the thought of what about me being not as beautiful, without having control of my body shape because of my treatment? \n\nI dont know if I did good, but in my own opinion she was toxic and I broke off our friendship. \n\nI feel bad but at the same time I feel better.
